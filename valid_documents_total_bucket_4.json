        "text": "I think we're ready good morning and welcome back the time is now 8:30 and I'd like to call the March 21st 22nd 2024 meeting of the energy facility sighting Council back to order Mr secretary please call the role Cindy Condon here Marcy Grail here Anne berer Katie IMS here Marcy Grail did I get that already sorry like skipping over the people who aren't here so I think uh Richard develin uh president remotely there we go um you have a quorum Madame Vice chair thank you Mr secretary now are there any agenda modifications this morning Madam Vice chair There Are No Agenda modifications at this time thank you I have the following announcements please mute your phones and if you are joining us by phone and receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other call for those who signed in signed onto the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam for agenda items D and F the contested case rule making public hearing and the public comment period there are two ways to let us know you are interested in providing comments to council for using for those using the web act you will need to use the raise your hand feature for those on the phone only you will need to press star three which will alert us that you want to speak we will go over these options again during that agenda item if you want to receive future email notifications of Council meetings project Milestones or rule makings through our click Dimensions program you can do so by clicking on the link in the agenda or on the council web page look for the green box on the right hand side of the page that says sign up for email updates you are also welcome to access the online project mapping tool and any documents by visiting the website please note that the audio and video of this meeting are being recorded and may be posted to the council's website following the meeting energy facility sighting Council meetings shall be conducted in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to State their positions at the appropriate times consistent with Council rules and procedures willful accusatory offensive insulting threatening insolent or slanderous comments which disrupt the council meetings are not acceptable pursuant to Oregon administrative rule and first did everybody get a chance to read the February minutes yes great do I have a motion to approve yes sure councelor Grail Madam Vice chair I moved at the council for the record this is Marcy Grail further Madam Vice chair I move that the council approve the minutes of the February 23rd 2024 meeting as present it and recommend it by staff we have a second second ire second any discussion all in favor oh all in favor say I I I Richard you and I minute thank you they are minute the February minutes are approved and now the Council secretary Cornett thank you madam Vice chair um so first starting with uh council member updates so at the last council meeting I had reported that council member Cho toots first term ended on March 15th of this year um and that he had requested to serve a second term unfortunately it was my mistake his term actually ends March 15th of 2025 so so I had incorrectly had his information uh in my tracking um tool and so he doesn't come up for um reappointment until next year on the positive side he's already put his information in executive appointment said he doesn't need to redo it so he's all set for next year so while it was an unfortunate mistake didn't have really any you know time ramifications so just a question on that because it was in the minutes um no this this will serve as this will correct the I mean it I mean the minutes reflect what the minutes were absolutely were unfortunately incorrect but now we'll have it on the minutes that that's that that's why I wanted to put it on this minute these meeting minutes to correct that okay thank you um on to project updates um as I had reported at the last meeting we received the notice of intent for the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility in nor Eastern Wasco County this would be a 201 megawatt wind solar and battery storage facility public notice was issued on March 14th and a public comment period is open until May 3rd we will be holding a public informational meeting on the project on April 3rd at the doofer k312 school gymnasium starting at 5:00 pm so if council members are interested in attending please let let me know either in person or virtually um you know we certainly encourage uh attendance you know are tracking that the only limitation would be you know if we end up having four that would be a quorum and we'll have to deal with that but if there are three or less that is certainly not an issue um also I had reported at the last meeting um on the Summit Ridge Wind Farm um which is largely the same as the new Summit Ridge renewable energy facility um that project has submitted their request to terminate the site certificate um so once they submitted that information we evaluated it there was missing information so we didn't provide the notice that's required after we received that uh We've since received all of the required information and um sent a notice on March 13th with a public comment period that concludes on April 1st so unless something changes we are on track to have that um in front of council at the next council meeting on April 19th for your review and possible termination of the site next uh missed amendment number 30 so this is for the Mist underground natural gas storage facility this project is an operational natural gas storage facility located on 5,472 Acres it has a permitted daily natural gas throughput of 635 million standard cubic feet it is comprised of underground natural gas storage reservoirs compressor stations Gathering pipelines onm facilities uh and a gas transmission pipeline the project was originally approved in 1981 uh has been amended 12 times and the certificate holder is Northwest Natural amendment number 13 proposes to replace and upgrade the two natural gas fired um compressors replace and upgrade an underground electrical power supply create a 7.5 acre construction lay down area that will be converted to a permanent storage uh after construction develop four existing storage reservoirs uh including above ground well pads to increase natural gas storage capacity so increasing the amount that they can um store at the site uh install injection and withdrawal Wells and transmission pipelines install three reciprocating natural gas fired compressors install two natural gas dehydration equipment systems and construct a new control and operations uh new control and operations buildings so we just received this um it will very soon be added to the project page where the amendment um can be looked at and uh we'll be sending out the notice very soon as well next on my list is the clth Falls Center early this week we received well we received the money uh for the notice of intent and I didn't get verification if we' received actual notice of intent but it was intended to come in this week um so this would be a 400 megawatt solar PV and battery storage project located approximately nine miles west of clamo falls on private land that is Zone Forest so this would be our first solar project zoned on on uh on Forest Zone Land versus exclusive Farm use Zone land uh project would be located on 7,350 Acres although the solar footprint self would be about 4,300 Acres or 6.3 square miles the developer is Savon which is a division of the Royal Dutch company um we have yet to create a web page for that um or obviously put the notice of intent on there um but that'll all be coming soon as well as uh establishing a date time location for um a public information meeting which would likely be in clouth Falls um so that will be coming soon any questions before I I'm this is chair Grail I apologize I just said oh if we go to Camp CL Falls I've not seen Perry in person before be opportunity um One update on a compliance issue so this is for the Reed College nuclear research reactor so at 11:43 a.m. on March 7th uh of this year uh an operator trainee operating uh the research reactor under the direction of a license operator initiated a planned manual scram uh following the planned manual scram the license operation or operator did not turn off the console the console switch um or remove the key from the console so they basically did a test they kind of walked away and left the literally the key in the ignition um um so the reactor did not meet the definition of reactor secured as a result of that action so the license operator then left the control room securing the door on their way out at 12:00 p.m. so this started at 11:43 a.m. basically 17 minutes later a licensed senior reactor operator entered the control room found the key in the console with the switch in the operate position they turned the switch off secured the key log the action notified the director so throughout the duration of the event all the control rods were fully inserted so this is we don't spend much time really talking about the Oregon State University or the Reed um College research reactors so these are small research reactors but they are nuclear reactors um and the read one particularly is is largely run by students um so obviously there are you know senior people who who have oversight over that but there's a lot of work that's done by the actual students uh in that program so the Oregon Department of energy on behalf of the energy facility sighting Council was not timely notified uh per o 345 03010 sub2 um which requires prompt notification by telephone of the occurrence of any incident or condition relating to the operation of the reactor that could have prevented a nuclear system from performing its safety functions as described in the technical specification so they basically should have let us know what happened um so max Woods who most of you know pretty well who is now the assistant director for nuclear safety and emergency preparedness um he has been in contact with the nuclear Regulatory Commission um they were timely notified of this incident so while we were not they were um per council's rules if there is a follow-up report to the nuclear Regulatory Commission then FC will receive a copy of that report so very likely um readed uh will create a report send it to NRC",

        "text": " an added layer of reliability and resiliency to this system so as of now with what we currently have if a major outage natural disaster weather event whatever it may be we're to take out system with our current capacity we are very limited to what we're able to do from an outage restoration perspective and a timely and uh matter this would create an adday of redundancy so if if anything were to happen in bourman or heran and this all went out for whatever reason we would be able to reroute power directly to the other 230 KB creating an added layer of resilience for number two again to assist and support Economic Development and future growth in the region and for this I want to highlight a certain area that some of you may be familiar with in recent years and especially in recent months as we know the Army chemical Depo transferred ownership to the Columbia Development Authority and with that we as the electric utility unit electric are anticipating a lot of growth a lot of development from economic job standpoint coming into the area and we want to be able to support and Aid in that growth for both youtil and moral counties the third one is to provide a clear transmission path for renewable energy so as we have seen the state of Oregon's mandates and standards Contin continue to increase and evolve this path would or this uh project would help create that path to help youtil Electric in our communities reach some of those standards and reach some of those mandates so that's a little bit about how we got to where we are tonight talking about the purpose and need of the project now I'd like to take some time to talk about the project itself so currently we're looking at a double circuit 230 kilovolt transmission system using steel single poles I'd like to reference the image on on the screen this is an actual render of what a pole may look like for this project the end points which is basically point A to point B is umil Electric's Highway 730 switch yard in moral County the project would head east to U's ordinance switchyard in umill county and from point A to point B that's looking approximately like 14 miles and the height of the structures the height of the steel single poles vary but typically they are 90 to to 120 ft and the span between structures so that's pole to pole again vary but typically 600 fet so that just gives you some fs and figures on the project itself and then we take it a step further and we perform what is called a route analysis or a route study and as you can see we have a defined area that we Define as our study area but to go into more detail and provide a little bit of more information I would now like to introduce Derek BS with our engineer thank you thanks W yeah so as um as won was describing the the first step in our our routing study is to establish a study area and so what we've tried to do is to give us multiple options between point a and point B here and so um you'll see to the to the left of the screen um is uh the this is bombing rang Road over here so we wanted to um look at options coming in from the West we also want to look at um options south of id4 so we we included roads um existing power lines in that area we also um wanted to give us some options to the north of id4 and so we had um a little band up there and and so that that's kind of the starting place and I'll kind of talk through the different steps of of how we've um gone through the routing process the first step is a is a desktop exercise where we pull um existing information um biological different land use cultural resources all all things that are publicly available um about um about the study area also look at some of the more engineering details where the existing roads existing utilities canals um agricultural pivots and so so once we establish um once we establish what what's out there we assign a a sensitivity level to that and and and the purpose of this is we want to equalize all the different um um all the different factors out there and identify what is what's going to have the biggest impact on on the area so um basically we we rank things high medium low so for this study area something that is high could be or was a a pivot an agricultural pivot um also federal land or if there's any endangered species those were also looked at high an example of something that is a lower sensitivity is if it's industrial land um commercial land there's no residential there there's no sensitive species around there that's going to be on the on the low side things and then the next step here is once we've identified all these different sensitivity areas we we start to put um like a spiderweb of rout links within the study here and these are all the different potential areas that that could connect us from point A to point B and we go through systematically and we compare um the the common end points of each of these different routes and and we start to eliminate which ones score better than others and so we look at a variety of factors we look at different land use we look at residential and we score these things and and we start to eliminate it down to the point where we have in in routes and what we've arrived at for for this study is we have four endin routes and that's what you'll see on the boards and I'll have a slide of that here in a so I talked about sensitivity and how we use this information is we composite that information kind of like a sheet of ply so we take the land use information the the biological information we look at flood planes cultural resources we take all this information we and we compress it together and so we we give ourselves a map that just shows what are all the high you know medium and low sensitivity areas and and so we're not biased it just based on what type of resource it is and this is the map of what our what our study area looks like once we've gone through and done that composite sensitivity so you can see there's a lot of RI um and that's really driven largely by all the agricultural pivots um there's there's other other factors that go in there as well you'll see on the um up here on the the old Army Depot there's some red that that's actually potential habitat for Washington ground squirrel so that's the reason that that's um mapped that way um one of the other important things to point out in this graphic here is even though there's a lot of red there's some there's some blue um woven in between and and the blue is the our opportunities and so what we consider um the opportunities as I mentioned before roads um power lines could be Rail lines it's basically where there's anything that's already built that you can kind of parallel that this can have less of an impact so going back you look at the blue and then you go the next slide this is um all our potential rout links and so you can see it aligns pretty closely with the blue with with with so many different High sensitivity constraints with with the with the pivots it really leaves us just kind of where where are the areas where there's the roads and power lines as the best opportunities to to site a line um and and you'll see we we generally as as we pair these down we want to at least give ourselves kind of three options as much as we can kind of throughout um and you'll start to see these end in routes kind of get paired down in that fashion so what you'll see here this is where we've arrived these are our four end routes and and so um I kind of want to talk through where we've eliminated some of these rout links and the reasons why um on the on the west side of the the study area along bombing range Road this area to the to the West is the the naval bombing range um there's there's constraints on how far you can move into that property there's also existing transmission on both East and the west side of boming Range Road and from a engineering feasibility standpoint there really wasn't room for another line and so what that's done is all these Southern routes all these route links here are were really put in place to potentially serve an opportunity went up bombing range Road and so um when we're going from point A to point B here dipping down this far south doesn't really it's not really too feasible another thing is um routs that were kind of in the middle of the study area but south of i84 um during some of the initial Outreach with land owners um we we receiv some feedback some preference against some of those routes um and so that was also a part of the reason that we eliminated some of those um routes of come in the center of the study area and so what we have here on the North I mentioned that we try to give ourselves three opportunities um however with um with the transfer of the the depot to the Columbia Development Authority U was able to um sign sign an easement across that property and so that allows us confidence that we have a route that goes across the the CDA um and so what we're really looking at is we've got four different options to the west of the the CDA property and then there's two um options here to the to the west or to the east where it crosses id2 there I think that's kind of the key um on those routes so that was that was an overview of our our routing study now for for the FC process we need to identify a site boundary um in in the noi and kind of moving forward and this basically what this represents is the potential temporary or permanent disturbance as a result of the project this this yellow polygon is much larger than than we're going to need for the project we we kept it a little bit larger on the CDA um so when we do further surveys before we submit the application we're going to need to do cultural surveys we're going to need to do biological surveys some other engineering work it gives us some latitude if there's things that we discovered to engineer around that um and in this you'll also see there's there's a lot of um while there are a lot of straight lines some of the lines that dip out that are kind of like semicircles around the corners those are um more for temporary servants for pulling and tensioning S so when you string the the line the conductor up um you need a little bit",

        "text": " back to that slide they're with the Alternatives they're giving us some Alternatives really we're evaluating the Alternatives we're not choosing Alternatives correct correct cor thank you however if it's possible you could um uh approve blank blank blank alternative and then if one of the Alternatives didn't meet a standard you do have an option of saying you know approve blank blank blank alternative and because this one alternative doesn't meet a particular standard for such and such reason you could not approve one of the Alternatives right but our job is just does it meet the standard correct right yeah so yeah not giving you sorry giving you the option thank you okay so that is kind of separating definitions application of definitions and in council's rules um and then the second part is um very similar to RFA 1 we're adding on Alternatives and this is very similar to rfa1 they are adding on they're not saying we're not going to do you know like we're going to remove these as options they're still just adding on options so one of the ways that I like to discuss like obviously I'm where's my notes there we go okay um one of the ways I we we talk about it is that it's additive right they're adding on adding on options for where to finally locate the transmission line um so it's so and when we look at that we're also then adding on acreage adding on site boundary however by Logic it it's they're not going to build out all those routes or roads It ultimately the final design and final facilities going to be you know like it's going to shrink in actual impacts and acreage and ultimately only one route or combo of routes will be selected right so um and let me here here it is so I think I don't want to misquote it so so if all of the rfa2 routes were selected for construction instead of the portion of the route that they would be replacing so if all of RFA 2 routes were selected the overall transmission line length would actually be reduced by .4 miles so like almost a half a mile it would be shortened if all of those were selected um so that's just kind of conceptually they're adding on but ultimately it's only going to be one final route in a combo of routes that would be selected um this is a table um it's just a a snippet um it's table two in the DPO starting on page 19 this lists out by County um the the Alternatives oh I don't think I told you I think it's 12 transmission lines so it's similar to rfa1 but it is it's bigger right um bigger as in there's just more Alternatives yeah 12 like 12 locations 12 route variations and this table does a good job of identifying the route um alternative by name but then also identifies other um changes that would be micro sighting area changes like are they moving around a multi-use area which is a construction area um or are they you know moving around or changing roads um and then it also provides a description for the addition which the vast majority of these changes um the certificate holder says are from ongoing coordination with land owners about the final placement of the transmission line or roads on their property and and a result of just final engineering as well so um they're proposing a midline capacitor station in Union County within the previously approved um what would be the micro sighting area now or site boundary um so this area has already been evaluated it's adjacent to an existing substation so capacitor Banks it doesn't have um uh Transformers it really is it's a station that helps like move on Long transmission lines helps like load and move like kind of push the power further to be able to carry it to its in destination Point um and so there's a couple conditions one of the conditions we recommended to change was this organizational expertise condition one which um addresses kind of inspections and maintenance programs for instance um this condition would require that the station maintenance program um be like results of it be reported to the department and that includes like monthly visual inspection inspections of buildings fences electrical equipment and annual infrared assessments for hot spots and then the Wildfire mitigation plan like the provisions and an operational Wildfire mitigation plan would you know as applicable would apply to the entire facility which would include this capacitor station and then um kind of going back in time when we look looked at request for Amendment one we said over there with the question of um hey Council does the does the amount of the bond or letter of credit it does it look sufficient and we had an evaluation there because I think for RFA 1 the route change was you know very negligible and we said nothing changed Council just looked at this the it's the same type of facility like we don't it's it's there's no change so really we feel like the previous amount which was $140 was still sufficient now over here it's kind of has been a little bit of time um and so one of the things that we look at that we really like having our updated unit costs um because even because the unit costs were getting a little bit old but really the trigger was that we now have a new type of facility component so we really want to kind of reopen we call it reopening retirement and relook at it we also pretty consistently at the department use are using this um kind of table spreadsheet you know applicants or certificate holders give us their retirement you know proposal and we kind of synthesize it and put it into this format um you know so we wanted to do that to kind of get it more um up to date with the tables and how we how we kind of look at retirement or how council's used to looking at it so we did that um certificate holder provided updated unit cost provided um costs for each type of facility component and restoration um and so we went from 20 Q3 2016 to q1 2024 and the updated amount is now 170 and so a million dollar and so we recommended that that amount is sufficient and are made changes to the conditions that are just specific to updating that amount and tying it to the quarter and year um so the CER iate holder is also and this is also again you know a result of getting into final engineering of the transmission line and Roads um the certificate holders requesting a a wider width of temporary construction roads to be able to you know basically get in the turning radius for some of the large equipment that would need to be delivered um to to some of these rural locations so um so this table here you know and I do have some red line we have a strike out of what it used to be so here on New Roads um that you know kind of like the the width logically so increases um the steeper the road gets um and for a maximum which would be a at a 30% slope the road may need to be widened up to 120 ft and again that's for construction they are not proposing to change the operational distance which is 14 ft so um let me see oh yeah and so and certificate holder explains that that this in that that maximum of like a 30% slope and the The 120t Wider Road would only be on about 3% of the new and modified access roads so in the DPO we kind of we talk about this um mostly in the soil protection um section um and really the the measures and we are not recommending any conditions be changed because we've looked at it and feel that conditions that we have would be sufficient to address any of the issues that we may see with this which are you know erosion and sediment control and also does the you know does the Reclamation revation plan um cover restoration of those roads to get them down to their oper operational width and then there's also measures and representations in the road uh classification and access control plan that um would would um cover this change as well what is my are we doing okay all right okay we're doing good okay so as part of uh RFA 2 certificate holder is um requesting um modifications to cond conditions um and so here is a list of the conditions some of them are from the certificate holder however you know as staff to council we also when we have an opportunity to look at this we are also making recommendations for some condition changes because you know in our compliance program and just as we are looking at things and realizing and working with reviewing agencies sometimes something or we are seeing that there are duplicative or conflicting requirements if we have an opportunity to you know clean something up or have it make sense we're going to take that opportunity so here's a list of some of those you know times that we do and there's some conditions that the certificate holder um you know requests or proposes in and it's included in RFA 2 and their Redline site certificate and we may take portions of it but we'll tweak it and make it consistent with you know condition language that we would normally use or that we think would be um easier more easy to implement so I'm going to touch just on a couple of these but again there is the list they're they're talked about these are provided uh anybody can see them in the redline site certificate which is attached to the DPO they're also talked about in each section so um this is consistent with um one of the requests from the certificate holder and we agree so we're kind of in the certificate holder department and the Oregon Department of Agriculture kind of cool coordinated a lot ongoing coordination on coming up with a mitigation plan for t&amp; plant species that would actually kind of work in the field and benefit potentially impacted t&amp; species like Lawrence milkvetch um and so ultimately uh the department Department of Agriculture and certificate holder did come up with this mitigation plan um it's included in the DPO and so we're recommending changes to the condition that that would then support doing that mitigation plan um whereas the condition kind of and I'm paraphrasing here completely um and and Sarah is our resident expert on Lawrence um so she can speak to it if anybody has any details but the condition previously said oh you know they'll do matting in the field if feasible and it just it really wasn't kind of uh sufficient protection for you know like avoidance and so this mitigation plan really kind of gets into um you know real mitigation that may make a difference for the T species so that said then we have the wording over here with fish and",

good to go there we go okay well we'll call this meeting of the climate action plan committee to order for Monday May 8 2023 present our hoy slider Stapleton welcome everybody and let's go around the room and uh have staff introduce themselves as well oh sure Heather denke management analyst with Public Works Ryan Zink I'm a franchise administrator and out of Finance Brian Martin the acting Public Works director he's still a city minute and our guests definitely working with us natural welcome and online we have Wendy Felice hi there Wendy the lease with PGE uh let's see so I did I just wanted to mention that I have appointed a new member to our committee Michael Slater welcome a member of our Planning Commission so he is joining us now as a full member uh it's we have time for public comment hi um thank you Mr Mayor um my name is Phil Carver for the 350 Salem and um and I thank you for the opportunity to make a public comment um we're pleased with many aspects of the climate action plan the PGE and uh the progress on renewable electricity and the agenda item I'm going to detail um but we're concerned that um this committee is not the right structure for doing the detailed analysis for um meeting the goals there needs to be a assessment of the ghd reduction potential which did not get really good in analytical analysis and original climate actions plan and for the three sectors the electricity sectors on on um even without the community program that would have accelerated um transportation is going to be a big um but the natural gas sector really remains unanalyzed in terms of the ability to meet the greenhouse gas goals so we would we really appreciate Michael Slater being added to this committee but we believe that in the summer a commission on molecular Planning Commission with a citizen with citizens um to take the time to really dig into the analytics of meeting the goals thank you thank you any other public comment on to item three approval of the 3 6 23 meeting minutes I will just put those up to next time then oh sure since we don't have enough all right it's fine and then on to uh item number four Portland General Electric clean energy plan and Community sword rules good morning Wendy thank you again for joining and I have your slide deck so whenever you're ready I can go ahead and get started thank you so much Heather thank you uh mayor and climate action committee City councilors uh a new member Michael I'm really happy to be here today and give you a little more information about the recently um file integrative resource plan and clean energy plan uh and so I'm gonna I'm gonna get through it through the slide deck feel free to ask questions there's a lot of information but we'll get through it so um the second slide Heather would be and can you hear us all right okay perfect second slide Wendy can you hear us all right yes can you hear me yes perfect okay hold on second there's this weird thing that's happening for me right now okay there we go so that's a little bit about PGE for those of you who don't um know about Portland General Electric we have been around for over 130 years and what this slide doesn't and we um have 16 generation facilities across Oregon and uh and Montana um what this slide doesn't share is that 46 of Oregon's population lives within our service territory and for those of you who are unaware in Oregon um Electric utilities have designated service area so we do not compete with each other and we cover about 51 cities uh 75 of organs commercial and Industrial activity occurs in our service area next slide please so I'm going to go through uh some information and at PGE we like acronyms but I thought I would just take this slide to walk through it with you so that uh it gives us all the same Foundation to work from as I'm as I'm go through the slide deck so um we recently fired up filed our integrated resource plan and our first clean energy plan on March 31st and so a little bit about the difference our integrated resource plan basically forecasts our system energy and capacity needs so it's giving it's giving it a long-term view on how we're going to meet our customers energy needs and it also provides um in addition to that our integrated resource plan um conclude it also includes a short-term action plan and the basis for any requests for proposals rfps now the clean energy plan that's um that is was required out of house bill 2021 and this one we filed together with our IRP and it's our first one ever and that one details pge's plans to meet emission targets and demonstrate our continuous progress towards that it also requires extensive Community engagement and must include Community benefits in meaningful ways together the integrated resource plan and this inaugural clean energy plan provide a comprehensive road map detailing how the company will meet customers energy needs and organs ambitious gas emission targets while still maintaining reliability safety and pge's path to these targets is possible with resources available today and I will get into that and talk about the company's strategy next slide please so to get we have huge goals uh and 350.org is very familiar and others in the room are familiar with our goals and I thought it would be helpful to talk about what these goals are which is our decarbonize our systems and you'll see our goals there and we are leading an energy transformation that will harness the power of clean and renewable resources on the Electrify side um customers and communities are electrifying Vehicles homes and workplaces and just a data point is a hundred percent of new car sales by 2035 will be electric vehicles um so it's not going to happen over time overnight it will be a transition and on the prefer side one of the things that our customers and communities depend on us to deliver affordable power to live work and play safely next slide please so how are we going to navigate this extraordinary transition um and as I mentioned on March 31st we released our clean energy plan and our integrated resource plan to the Oregon Public Utility Commission and now they will take some time to evaluate and review these and this combined plan is over a thousand pages long and I'm gonna try to summarize it here in this one slide for you uh interestingly I've spent a a good two weeks getting through it so it is long but um we modeled all of our load forecasts uh we looked at all of our generation and Supply options and we are proposing a five-part action plan which the piece P the Oregon Public Utility Commission will evaluate we puc there are five major actions and they are as follows customer actions uh we will not be able to achieve our Collective decarbonization goals without engaged customers and that means customers doing Energy Efficiency upgrades signing up for load shifting programs at lower usage during peak times when we ask them it will also require large Renewables wind and solar we need to cite additional additional large wind and solar facilities and we need to do it to diversify our portfolio on the small solar storage we also must support the siding of small solar and battery stores throughout communities including Salem and Marion County to add a bit to the complexity of this we are investing in a technology platform that basically Aggregates all these small batteries demand response programs like thermostats and solar panels into what we call a virtual power plant that we can basically ramp up or down like we do a regular power plant ultimately this platform could include anything that allows us to shift or add load so batteries at home or from plugged in vehicle or even just the ability during a peak time to start charging your vehicle if it's plugged in and wait to charge it in the middle of the night um so I can talk and I can mean I could do the entire uh hour on a virtual power plants but the key that I want to convey is that we will increasingly be using technology to make the system more efficient and shift load that can be shifted to better match the available Um which I can share is uh partly because solar and when uh is intermittent so we we'll need that ability and then D the um I have it listed here storage and that is primarily battery storage and then transmission at the highest level PGE strategy involves a wide array of commercially available tools in the clean energy uh toolkit between now and 2030. next slide please we really want to talk about maintaining affordability and safe reliable affordable and clean are the four attributes we focus on and affordability is a big one lately with inflation and added costs to volatility in fuel prices and extreme weather events and the Investments we are needing to make at a high level giving customer tools to control and manage their own costs is a big priority for us this includes an improved dashboard that shows their energy use and when they may be using power and also they can set the text alerts to notify them when their Bill gets to a certain level second we have a new program launched last year called the iqbd it's another PGE acronym which offers 15 or 25 discounts off electric bills to people of qualified income levels and that's where the iqbd comes we have seen strong enrollment in this program and are continuing to enroll people this year this is on top of the bill assistant programs that already existed and are run by community-based organizations and which street and which we received a significant Boost from the federal government recently um third the federal the recent Federal legislation and that is the investment the iija funds and the IR the IRA are there to help support this clean energy and we are frankly doing everything we can to get us in our region more than our fair share in the competitive process we are in the process of applying for nearly 500 million dollars in Grants to asset costs that customers would otherwise need to pay and we are hopeful about this process we're looking uh forward to working with you and other local governments to support Grant applications that we are eligible for and finally we are doing everything we can to manage our own costs this includes managing our own portfolio and purchasing Advanced contracts to keeping our own overhead basically flat even the face of significant inflation next slide please I just wanted to get a little more detail about customers and communities and that's by 2030",

        "text": " be more explicit that you have to provide that I think it's I think it's implied that it's that the department would have that right uh but if you think you want to make it stronger and say that you should provide those qualifications that demonstration to the Department's satisfaction we couldn't we could supplement to state um thanks and again this is really for discussion more um to provide a base I'm not sure what I believe right now I've certainly thought about it a lot but I view the timing as um somewhat problematic given the site certificate already exists at this point but I I certainly understand it's an attempt to well that's that's fair but they might not know who they're going to use to retire a facility right so so that's why it's built in that that says before you retire before you construct give us that make that demonstration yeah and I I fully understand that that there's a timing to their work too but um okay thank you okay Nancy can you bring us back to the first Ubi I think slide nine there you go thank you all right so we'll talk now too about retirement and financial assurance uh the purpose of this standard is twofold one make sure that the site will be adequately restored after the facility is no longer being operated uh and two make sure that funds are available to restore the site if the certificate holder walks away from a facility in other words protect the State against having to pay to restore the site I've highlighted in subsection 2 that Council must find the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit but before we discuss that I'd like to talk about subsection one to support Council making that first finding that the site can be restored to a useful non-hazardous condition the applicant must include certain information about site Restoration in the application next slide please Nancy so this is from our division uh 21 ST which of course sets forth everything that must be included in an application in exhibit W the application must include information about site uh this is all the information that they I've highlighted in C the fact that they must provide a cost estimate uh of what it's going to cost to restore the site the cost estimates are important because they form the basis for the dollar of the bond or the letter credit uh reminder that Bonds in letters of credits under our process your process our adjusted annually to account for the department also typically recommends that the bond or letter of credit include a cushion above the estimated costs of restoration so there might be a cushion typically a 10 extra for project five to ten percent extra for future it's called future development contingency that allows for uncertainty in the decommissioning cost estimates so for example in the future there might be different environmental standards or legal requirements that are more expensive to comply with uh it might just cost more to dispose of the equipment that's being dismantled uh the cost of Labor and equipment might increase at a rate that exceeds the standard inflation adjustment so that's why we include that future development contingency that question next slide please so this is a mandatory condition yeah included in all site certificates so it's important to bear in mind that the certificate holder must provide the bond or letter of credits before beginning of the facility so in other words the bond or letter of credit is provided after Council issues the site certificates but before construction begins but remember as I mentioned for Council to issue the site certificate the standard requires Council to find that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining the bond or letter of credit again because applicants are often single purpose LLCs they don't they might not have the relationship with a financial institution that their parents company does therefore when submitting the applicants often present Comfort letters in which the financial institution references its willingness to back the parents company we'll look at a couple examples yeah next slide please Nancy so hopefully you can read this uh this is a comfort letter that we received in the recent past and I like this one because it references not just the parent company but the LLC the by name the applicant by name and it also describes the type of project uh that that is being applied for it says it's a solar energy generation facility next slide please Nancy sometimes the Comfort letters don't reference the applicant or the project by name they reference just the parent company to say we've got the relationship with the parent we're good with that that's fine because as we've discussed the certificate holder still has to provide the bond or letter of credits before they begin construction so we're still protected but going forward I would still recommend I'd recommend that the Comfort letters be more explicit and reference the applicant by name and include just a brief description of the project that way we have a clear statement from the financial institution that the Comfort letter applies not just to the parent but it also applies to the applicant and the project at issue next slide please Nancy Cherry Brill this is Kent Patrick the um this is just my ignorance here it says in that example the issuance of a single Bond they must be qualified for issuance of a single bond in the amount of 10 million with an aggregate capacity of 200 million what does that mean the aggregate capacity of 200 million I suspect just off the top of my head that they're saying they would provide just what it says they can one single bond for 10 million probably for one project but they have their total credit with that financial institution the most they could do for all their projects would be 200 billion that's what I suspect that means okay okay good thanks that's what I needed Patrick yeah um this is Cindy uh one of the um or Cindy Condon I guess for the record um the one of the um things I thought about in uh this it's my understanding that we get Comfort letters at the front end before we issue a site certificate um but we do not currently ask for updates of that I mean these projects can take certainly some time to develop years and I don't think we ask for uh evidence that this Comfort can still exist we don't update these letters at all until the security is required um and it's actually the security as opposed to a comfort level a letter is that correct uh Todd my field answered that better for us uh that that could be that we we just get the one Comfort letter and then that we don't ask for it to be renewed uh it sounds like if that is how we handle it you would you would like them to to update the Comfort letters um I think it was it would be prudent to do so you know uh we just we've seen some thinking uh some uh things in the financial industry recently and we know there is some uncertainty about uh these projects and if they will be developed at all um and what happens to developers and it seems like a comfort letter issued five years earlier Main it may there may not be a comfort issue a letter issued five years later so you're suggesting though the scenario you're describing would be one in which the site certificate hasn't been issued yet so they provided the Comfort letter early in the application process site certificate hasn't been approved um that is the one instance but then if we're five years out from from issuance of the site certificate or three years out even um just like with the letter of credit is would would the same institution be willing to um provide the security instrument that gave us comfort when we first received it you know what I mean so I think I'm following you so then what you're saying so in this instance what you're describing the science certificate has been issued yes and that is why would it not be sufficient to rely on the condition that requires them before they begin construction to actually provide the bond or letter of credit um well I guess um it would give us a heads up that if there were no comfort you know we asked for uh renewal of a comfort letter um a confirmation of the previous Comfort letter or whatever and they refuse to do it I don't know it might give us a heads up um as to the financial situation but um yeah that's the only reason so I I can respond uh on a couple of different scenarios the first is if during the application process you know if an applicant submits their decommission costs but we do not agree with that and determine that the costs are actually uh greater than that and the Comfort letter is less than what we um more recently we've gone back to to the applicants and said you need to submit a different Comfort letter which shows that you have at least this amount um like I said that we haven't done that historically but within the last couple of years I think we've been consistently doing that so that's one scenario and second is between you know the um and the going into construction um no we have not uh required an updated Comfort letter uh within that time frame um so you know that could be you know four or five years old that would certainly be an easy condition to put in if you wanted to have some frequency of providing an update but but we've not done that um as Patrick had indicated we rely on the fact that they still have the requirement to submit the bond or letter of credit in the amount necessary so that ends up being a filter that if they can't provide it um the certificate will terminate because they won't have the ability to go into construction so that's just a um sort of a go no-go kind of requirement but you know we could obviously look at you know any kind of frequency of updates and then I'd say the third scenario if they do come in for an amendment to extend out the construction um you know we we do evaluate and whether they still have the fish sufficiency at that point so we would require a new Comfort letter at the amendment for a Time extension request or beginning Construction um so just so if uh if a request for Cindy Condon actually for the record um so if the requests were made um for an amendment an extension um it's at that time so we're three years let's say three years out and that's I think the maximum maybe that I've seen um that for completion of or beginning of construction um that there would be a comfort letter at that point which is certainly more timely we're not waiting eight years or you know correct for multiple extensions okay yeah because at that point they still have two I mean you know theoretically they have to show that they meet all of the standards again mostly they can rely upon what was in the record um but sometimes we have to evaluate you know what are the their changes",

        "text": " um certainly want to give um commissioner Sheron and Mary morland's an opportunity to weigh in if they want on any Reflections they have about this but but um one uh just maybe note for commissioner Decker and director Benner about two and a half years ago I think we had a did a deeper dive on um Regional markets and transmission as two of the really key um P things that that need to go well if if we're going to meet our goals and I just uh welcome um you to both uh propose agenda items for future meetings where um there might be some relevant updates and considerations um especially as we start thinking about uh developing our next um banial report but but anytime we can uh be a platform for kind of making sure those are those things are front of mind um and many of the other things you know probably it would be helpful for us to have a better understanding of energ burden and equity and rate classes as well and just how how to think about that um going forward so just um this has been really helpful um commissioner um any any any feedback on that now or um otherwise I'll open it up to commissioner Sheron or Mary morins to I think You' highlighted a couple of great ones and and we're always happy to um or you know subject to Resource availability we're we're happy to come visit with the commission that's great commissioner Sharon do you want to add anything um well first of all uh you know want to appreciate uh chair Decker's presentation um uh certainly find it helpful to sort of see the work that we're doing in this broader context of you know all the other plans um and and compliance mechanisms in play across the state um that impact the energy sector I think the the point that um I really want to underscore and and really appreciated was uh when when Cher Decker talked about sort of the iterative nature of this and and how we no sooner sort of file one plan than we're you know well underway of um of preparing the next and just how Dynamic this current environment is I mean it's always Dynamic and that's why our PS have always been on sort of a two-year cycle but even with that um you know history um this particular period is more Dynamic um than most and you know the inclusion of the federal funding with the IRA is really potentially GameChanger in a lot of ways the ramifications of which I think we're all still trying to you know wrap our arms around and just maybe as one quick example to underscore this um and for folks who are who sort of have followed along with sort of pge's you know IRP clean energy plan process but you know we we first filed back at the end of March and then did a fairly significant update over the summer months to capture the fact that in that interim period from when we began the modeling you know to when we filed um and then by summer um the combined effects of sort of load growth on our system and some of which are being fueled by federal incentives but not entirely um was significant enough and material enough that you know we had to file a significant update um in terms of sort of what our long-term energy need will be um um and how that plays into you know the how the utility is thinking about the resources that are appropriate to both meet our our load requirements reliably and affordably but also hit those decarbonization targets so you know that's just one example of sort of many things that are like sort of constantly in play and um and it will continue to be an iterative process and and and ultimately you know that even though you know we'd love I think all of us my team in particular who uh is you know already thinking about sort of the next round of of IRP modeling um you know with their eyes wide going wow I can't believe we're talking about this already um well we all might love sort of clarity say nope this is the plan and and we've Inked it and let's go forward and you know we'll see you all in a in you know in 10 years and see how it looks the reality is that it's in the best interest of the system and the customer and our long-term you know greenhouse gas reduction goals that this be an iterative process and that we continuously update um with all the new information and and as the market continues to change and adapt so uh patience and Grace um with all players involved as we all navigate this landscape um but uh hopefully we're all driving in the right direction thanks thank you Mary do you want to add anything um absolutely and thank you uh chair McDonald and chair Decker I want to Echo the appreciation for the presentation I um I both smiled and cringed to see all the the policies on one slide together it was a very effective tool um and uh and I think a visual one I'm going to definitely um use myself so thank you for that um I did want to just say that iterative is the word of the day U when we think about how we're learning in the process of utility planning um and really appreciate the awareness um of the commission and just policy makers broadly as we work towards that uh really Justice focused uh future for for utility planning and and just utility delivery so I just wanted to express my appreciation and uh see a lot of things that were not surprising uh but good uh good phrasing and um we have a lot ahead of us as we work towards these shared goals thank you absolutely and um Colin uh mccon do you want to add anything or or um perhaps we could U ask you to do kind of a similar how are things going on the implementation side for this CCP we can't hear you can you can you hear me now we can thank you oh okay I I guess I'm double muted apologies again for that uh I I was just saying yet chair McDonald would be happy to to uh provide a presentation on our CPP implementation and I think for today all I really am prepared to say is is just to actually Express uh gratitude to uh Cher Decker and her staff uh our agencies are work together uh in partnering in our respective regulatory spaces uh more so than we ever have in the past and it has been very helpful for for me and for my team uh to have that partnership at the at the Public Utility Commission um but again uh happy to dive more deeply into the CPP and and our implementation of that program with the commission at a at a future date thank you appreciate that any other uh questions for chair for commissioner Decker it looks like we do have a question in in the chat for chair Decker if she'd like to take that um I think we're doing okay on time if you are willing to do that J Decker yeah let me go ahead and I'll unmute arleene if she wants to ask that we could also um hear the question during public comment if um commissioner Decker you're able to stay on for that I don't see Darlene coming off mute so why don't why don't we um Move Along happy to stay on at least until 3:00 um yeah great I think I yes that that'd be great thank you and I think um I'll just kind of close by um thanking those that spoke up for their comments and and also um uh to note that in addition to the sort of compliance interactions and and other issues that we work on together with d EQ our engagement with the Oregon Department of energy becomes uh increasingly important and you know from our perspective making sure some of the critical questions that are coming up um in integrated resource plans are effectively treated in the kind of planning work that they're doing you know is important and we're having you know good conversations there so appreciate that absolutely really important role uh director Benner anything you want to add in yeah thanks I just wanted to Echo the appreciation for um chair Decker joining us today and walking through this I really appreciate the framing and especially the reminder that the mandates are not self-executing emissions reductions and I think that's really important for this group but also um important for the Oregon Department of energy as we advance uh our state energy strategy and look to leverage Federal funding and support of all of these activities and really appreciate the partnership of pu and DEQ and others as we look to how that Federal funding can support the um achievement of the really ambitious um policies and programs that we have in place so thanks for coming chair Decker thank you director Benner um well let's go ahead and um Abby can you kind of let us know how many folks we think might want to provide public comment and if if you do want to provide public comment and you haven't let us know um please do so now so we can kind of manage our time I'm currently only seeing that one question um from arleene in the chat and then I don't see any hands raised so give it couple of minutes I saw one uh about the relationship biodiversity and the work that we're doing so I don't not sure I completely I'm not sure I know who that was posed toward um so if um AR artimo PA wants to uh ask that question or put in some comments happy to have you do that and Abby if you could kind of maybe work with Arlene to help her get off mute yeah absolutely um I'll go ahead and unmute arene here on my end and she should be able to to go ahead and speak AR maybe it looks like you're still here uh we can always um follow up with Arlene after the meeting and find out what her question was and and forward that to you um commissioner de Decker yeah I just said the same thing in the chat so for thaning SAR okay that looks good arene is appreciating that um and we're not seeing any additional um hands raised relative to public comment so with that I can maybe move to next steps and um one correction I wanted to make is that I had mentioned that the natural and working lands meeting with the relevant uh natural resource agencies was the 14th I should have said the 16th uh which is a Monday not a Saturday uh like the 14th is so um I just wanted to correct that for folks um in especially in the agencies and um and then we have also offered a one-on-one meeting for any agency that can't make that",

received any comments uh no we have not and can we check with Brad just make sure no one's online right I will moving on to new business I will now turn it over to the city's city manager proem Craig Sheldon so the the first uh we're GNA pick off pick up right where we left off uh the first fund we're gonna talk about is the public art fund that was a new fund we created this fiscal year um Kristen will mention a little bit about what they've been working on in the fund and then I can talk about the numbers so I think uh most of you are probably aware that we have our first large sculpture project that is being created and it will be in the Oregon Street roundabout um it's of deer um and we're working with an artist over in Central Oregon I just received an update from her today uh the molds are complete and she's working with The Foundry um so we should have some pictures and some updates real soon um but work is progressing so we're very excited about that I do not have an install date but we'll let you all know once I have that um the other thing that we're going to be working on in regards to public art this year is updating the master plan now that we have actually identified a funding source we want to make sure that we have a plan in place moving forward to implement um some additional artworks down the road and whether that's through murals or more sculpture helping identify what those locations will be so so that's actually part of our C the council goals as well is to update that Parks or the public art master plan um so that's the main project that we'll be working on this year in addition to getting the sculpture piece installed any questions so what was the funding source the funding David do you want to speak about that a little bit Yeah so the uh funding sources is from the trans lodging tax dollars um that that fund had been building up dollars over years and now that we when we finally had our first hotel here in the city those dollars started to increase pretty significantly and so that that's the funding source um if you were to look at the the financial aspect that's where the revenue comes from it's a transfer from the general fund you know we're we're transferring all of our Transit loding tax into the public art fund and then from there some unrestricted dollars are moving two various funds one is the public art fund and another one is The Economic Development Fund but transi Logitech dollars can be used it's tourism related art is T tourism related and so is the art center so we're GNA talk about the T later yeah and so ju just looking at the uh basically the $37,000 represents the percentage that is moved into this fund and it's based off of how much we anticipate we're going to take in in the transit lodging tax fund um which we'll get to and what I did is I allocated at least all the $37,000 and available to spend because I knew that I know that U the the master plan was on council's goals and something that we're going to look at uh working on this year or next fiscal year so any questions on the public art fund the next fund is the economic development and promotion fund I'll cover a little bit of this um some of the goals is the complete an Oldtown strategic action plan I know that's in the works right now encourage and facilitate approval of phase two and three of the Sherwood Commerce Center uh development and recruitment of businesses to the paneton Rock Creek Corporate Park uh Bruce is going to be Bruce our amazing uh economic development manager is going to be attending some trade shows um kind of networking in the Portland metro area and then just continue to work with existing industrial and Retail businesses just to help them remain in the city and grow within the city um and you might see a little bit of activity now in this proposed budget compared to Prior year because uh when we created this fund we kind of really had to develop a plan on how we're going to utilize this money and Bruce working with Craig they developed the plan um when you look at like materials and services majority of that consists of the Oldtown strategic plan uh the cost of that some of that is housed in the general fund too it's kind of sharing the cost uh to produce that plan and then Personnel Services is part of Bruce's time and part of his time is also in the UR since he's focusing on kind of those Economic Development uh functions this upcoming year and that $75,000 just represents the portion of unrestricted dollars that normally would have helped fund the art center is now helping to fund this uh this Economic Development promotion fund any questions on the economic development promotion 75,000 are you talking about the 75 yeah the $75,000 that's the percentage portion because so basically we're we're transferring in the transit loding tax dollars into the art center and normally the general fund funds 100% of the the art center so now that frees up unrestricted dollars that now we can allocate it to one council's goals of Economic Development and promotion so represents um the portion when we had that work session that uh is to be distributed to this fund the next fund is the transi lodging tax fund um some of the goals is to just to continue to research and develop a plan to grow this tax program I know there's eventually will be a second Hotel be built here in Sherwood um I think that might have been put third and a third I'll take a fourth and fifth to help grow this program but you know that's basically where most of the dollars come from yes do we have some airbnbs and uh folks renting out their their homes yes we have a little bit of that but the majority of the revenue comes from the current hotel there um I want to say it's either 25 26 or 26 27 yeah start construction and yeah start but yeah the hotel I think is planned to go somewhere behind or somewhere over there by his by the ler storage okay yeah so that be once that is built then you're going to see this Revenue stream increase which will help fund the public art fund and The Economic Development Fund even more so we're slowly building the this uh Revenue base upad no you go first I'm just trying to remember the are you using actual TLT money for the public art fund or is that the general funds portion that you're giving yeah so what we're doing is we're we're moving the money to the uh Art Center uh that's a tourist attraction it brings in a lot of folks from around town it can be used for that um 30% of any Transit logy tax dollars is really unrestricted under the state law 70% has to be used utilized to for um tourism related um um things or objectives so we're we're moving all that money into the public art fund or or the the the art center department and now the money that would normally help fund the art centers now un those unrestricted dollars were moving into these other funds to help general fund is still getting that 30% yes yeah okay yeah so really it's the the art Center's funded 30% but that's just the unrestricted dollars and and U that's what the art Center's retaining so the is fed by sorry the the Beaverton just built that big art center and their funding stream is TLT dollars and uh and from Beaverton and Washington County because they're collecting T bton collects TLT Washington County collects TLT so for instance if you look at a bill for state wood you're going to there's a city component and a county component and when you say Washington County you're really talking about twon Valley some goes there some goes Direct I don't know the exact numbers but that's one of the ways they fund that there's a little mechanism and I believe Beaverton is the one that used this where you we have a set percentage we can charge here that was voted on and passed here um through the city that the city charges a percent on lodging you can temporarily raise that rate to build a specific project like an art center is in what Beaverton that's how they funded the building of that project but be clear David you're not 100% right the county in their 9% they collect they have pledged and delivered part of that to run the a million dollars a correct well a lot of Washington count are um so I guess I'm a little confused with the the idea of I mean whenever I look at the TLT I mean I think we might be pushing a little bit that the art center is a tourism completely related facility but um it's also supposed to increase I mean how it states is promotion of Tourism and how many other cities um have chosen to do 100% back to the city in some facility it just seems like a lot of cities around us actually support other organizations that do more tourism promotion well it's amazing the Arts Center they",

the energy facility energy a facility signing Council and I am here today actually presenting my first the first rulemaking that I've been involved in uh from the start well sort of from the start as you'll um and if we could just kind of go around and if you could tell me your I'll call on you uh and then if you could tell me your your full name your organization who you represent and why you're

renewable Northwest and we are interested in citing because it's super important to meeting our clean energy goals and also want to um you know just an interest in finding good public process around everything that we do so that's why we're here um oh and we have um we have developer members who are regular applicants here at fsec as well so it's kind of important to mention thanks all right um Bryce yeah uh Bryce Foster the director of project delivery for Pacific War and uh obviously have an interest in this because uh it has an impact on what my uh my group absolutely uh hi everybody Jack

the uh the manager Environmental Compliance and our biggest asset on our system is under abstract jurisdiction and this is always important to us all right so hopefully this works uh let me know everybody can see that trying to my uh my I think I crashed because I my my external monitor connection failed on me so I'm now trying to make it work with just my laptop monitor which is fun always good to learn new things on the fly when there's people waiting uh just so you know this yeah I just want to reiterate this is the uh you know first rack that I've done myself so uh I interested Chris the prior roll making uh coordinator to be on standby to make sure that I don't uh you know give you guys bad information so if he steps in with an act well actually uh I I told him to you know don't hesitate so just to kind of go over the agenda here um we I'm just going to present what I presented uh previously to council and uh kind of give you guys an overview of the rule making the scope and kind of our current uh thinking on you know how we're going to approach this uh rulemaking I'm gonna open it up to questions uh depending on how long we go have a break if people don't want to have a break we can skip that um we'll see we'll play it by ear uh and then we'll provide an opportunity for public uh comment and uh we'll also have a discussion discussion at the end for kind of next steps uh and also just as just as a reminder as part of the uh kind of question comments are all making if anybody has any special considerations for their concerns about how impact this would impact uh small businesses or anything along those lines uh please speak up see I'm going to attempt to make the display screen there we go slightly larger so I can see my notes better so first I thought I'd give you a little background on the rulemaking process um for those of you who are not deeply versed in in the process so typically what we do is we um propose to council to initiate a rulemaking and then would develop a a a draft of the proposed rules with with potentially the help of Iraq in this particular case we actually because of this kind of like very procedural nature um kind of the nuts and bolts of this um particular rulemaking we actually kind of scoped it out and kind of came up with a relatively Advanced proposal of the Draft rules for uh two Council and presented that to them and they approved that as part of the initiation of the rulemaking process um but I just wanted to point out and make sure that you guys understand that um that approach and we didn't intend to shortchange the rack process uh or the ability for public to provide comments and feedback uh on any proposed rule language or to offer their own suggestions on how we can optimize the citing process uh within the scope of the rulemaking uh that has been approved by Council so we are uh here uh still in the development of the draft proposed rules section once we as Iraq kind of move forward and the comments by the rack are receiving and kind of processed uh we would then uh present that to council uh and if they approved it we would do a notice of proposed rulemaking uh at that point there would be an additional public comment period uh and if you didn't you know if there's some things you'd from any new comments you want to make you can make them as just part of as part of the formal public comment period it's not um you're not prevented from participating just because you're on the rack so you have extra chances to comment uh I suppose uh there's no there's no limitation on that uh once that formal comment period is is completed uh it's several weeks um we then kind of take those comments uh incorporate them respond to them uh make our recommendation to council and then assuming the council agreed and was satisfied with the the the state of the rules at that point we would uh submit them to the Secretary of State for um uh adoption as a permanent rule um so I thought it would be helpful for everyone on this call to to kind of go over what we're what we're hoping to accomplish with this rule making but also with kind of like where we're where we're headed because this rulemaking is kind of tied to the next one which is tied to the next one and I know not everybody is um and it was as excited about this first phase quite a few people were like reach out to us in phase three and I totally get that um the this phase is going to be a little bit less interesting uh less substantive than than perhaps phase two and phase three um",

        "text": "welcome everyone we're really glad to have you today this is our fourth and final workshop for this um this particular effort that's a result of house bill 2021 we really want to thank the work group members and the members of the public who've been joining and following along in this um i think i want to make sure that i um start off just one thanking everyone for making the time these workshops have been long you've had to focus and be helpful and provide information in between because the bill is written so that this is the work group study and not the oregon department of energy study it means that a lot of the onus for planning and for sharing information and thinking about what ought to be in the report has fallen to you all and we're here to staff you and help collect this information and report it back out so i just kind of want to set the stage there to start with just the first thing out of my mouth today because i think as we're sort of filling finishing up with the workshops we still have a whole another six weeks of really we have two months until the report's due but about six weeks of work that we'll be doing as um a policy staff and we'll be continuing to work with the work group to make sure that we're getting the report right so just know that while this is the last workshop it's not the end of the line for our work group members so just really wanted to set the stage there and we'll talk about next steps at the end of the meeting as well i'm sure you've all enjoyed looking at our mission and what we do while i've been talking but um just we always want to remind people this is what the oregon department of energy does and in particular this is an example of us a venue for problem solving oregon's energy challenges and we've been really excited to take on that work at the behest of the legislature we can go to the next slide please this is a slide you've seen before we're recording this meeting so just a heads up we might click i think it is already recording but just a heads up on that and then also just so you know um i'll i'll put it in the chat in a minute or somebody else can that's um on staff and if they feel like taking care of that but we have a webpage for this study that has all the materials we've shared ahead of meetings during meetings the recordings in the past slide decks so just know that that's all there we'll get the slide deck up for today and the video up for today after today but just know that that those materials are there for you and that after this meeting we'll have everything loaded up in there if anyone's interested in looking back at past conversations we use we are big fans of the chat here at the department of energy feel free to ask questions there and when the time's right we'll get those questions asked to the right person or sometimes answer them in the chat you can also use the raise hand function asking a question or making a comment please note that this is a worker meeting so for the most part um the chat and the raise hand raised hand function this is to facilitate work group conversation we have public comment toward the end of the meeting and then or for the end of the meeting we also have breakout sessions in which we elevate anybody here from the public into the mix of that breakout breakout conversation and you're welcome to participate in those as a member of the public as well so just sort of a heads up on sort of protocol there and then we have some workgroup agreements that we've been using for all of our conversations at the department of energy borrowed from a state of oregon event last year really just hoping as always for an inclusive and respectful meeting so asking that folks be respectful the agenda and the time limitations that we have a reminder that learning can happen outside of comfort zones and sometimes you may not agree with something but hopefully you can listen and learn and also a reminder to listen to learn and not just listen to talk which is like a mantra of mine because i'm a big talker so that's you listen to that too and then avoid speculation and accusation and finally just one piece of logistics if you have technical issues like we did today um or questions you can contact linda ross in the chat you can also contact me if you want about anything along the way um by chatting me and i'm happy to be helpful or make sure that a certain point gets raised at the right time or anything like that so with that i think i get to hand things over to stephanie bowles who is our senior economist at the agency and is our lead on the report that's going to come out of this work group and she'll be for the most part leading the meeting and then i'll be helping out keeping an eye on the chat and helping to make sure everybody's being hurt during the conversation today thank you christy all right so quickly i'll just go and flash this up there since we're tight on time um due to technical difficulties um so we have three speakers that we'll be presenting today um and then we're going to talk a bit about the c-rep initial application round results um that are still in progress so very brief slide there we're going to have a discussion of the guiding principles for our recommendations then we'll have a short lunch break um then we're going to move straight into our recommendations breakout have a big round up from the breakouts um discuss the outline and the gaps in the outline and then move to public comment so i will move on over to um christy do you want to take this one oh sure i kind of already covered the first topic but after i said it thank you for serving on the work group work's not done we still have six more weeks together but this is our last workshop and then um just a reminder of sort of our objective that we set to convene a work group to examine opportunities to encourage development of small scale and community community-based renewable energy projects in the state that contribute to economic development and local energy resiliency thank you christy all right so moving on over to our uh first up we're going to have mark thaliker from three sisters irrigation project so i'll hand it over to you mark okay sorry about that for for some reason i just it just doesn't seem to want to let me in yeah i don't know well anyway uh so tsid um has been doing irrigation modernization for the last uh 25 years and we're in the process of completing uh piping all 65 miles of the irrigation district we're in the process of building our third hydro plant right now which is a 300 kw horizontal francis our previous projects have included a 200 kw hydro net meter demonstration project which has got four small turbines in it for a total of 200 kw and that project was designed not only to show people small turbines but also on farm turbines because when we're all done piping the uh we're going to have over 60 locations where we can do on-farm uh either net meter or uh power purchase agreement with the farmers with the co-op and uh that represents a whole nother megawatt of power uh the first project was uh the 700 kw uh watson horizontal francis turbine and um you know that's where we started learning about the challenges of trying to move um power purchase agreement power to cec has a wheeling tariff and uh that it's a real quick uh consists of basically uh five dollars and 34 cents per kw per month uh for the distribution system and then 90 cents per kw per month for the transmission and currently right now we're generating anywhere from about 150 to 200 000 of revenues that wheeling tariff consumes uh about 55 000 of our power generation um you know one of the things that i've constantly tried to talk to the puc about is that you know when you do a small hydro project you have to do a system impact uh and so you know we paid for that and then basically central electric co-op upgraded all three legs um of the system so that they could then move our power either out to tollgate and hudu or to the sisters substation or all the way over to eagle crest and so a hundred percent of our power right now is consumed by cec and then really all we have is a use of agreement with bonneville and they flip our power over the bus at the redmond substation to pacificorp there actually really isn't any ever any power actually being 20 miles back to the redmond sub uh cec consumes 100 percent of our power and um so in essence we're opening up bandwidth on the transmission lines uh for cec between the bpa substation and here and so you know this is kind of an inequity that uh is is problematic and for smaller projects uh it becomes even you know a big a bigger problem because uh they're harder to to finance so ultimately though um you know we've been very successful we build all our own projects ourselves uh which makes us unique um my guys have actually installed everything uh as well as uh you know building the buildings and putting in all the turbines and uh this particular project that we're finishing up right now actually ran into a two-year delay because central oregon land watch tried to basically uh extort more water from the district uh and and just to explain how conserved water works in the state of oregon we go ahead and do an engineering analysis on the canal loss and then when we apply for our grants which started literally eight nine years ago we let them know how much conserved water we have and then how much conserved water we're willing to put in stream uh for listed species and fish uh and then you know we make that deal and so we build the first we built basically the penn stock first and that was six phases and that was a 10 million dollar project and uh we actually originally identified about eight and a half cfs and we were going to put back six but ultimately we ended up putting back eight uh and then that gets certificated by the oregon war resource department and those certificates are create a in-stream water right that is now protected in perpetuity land watch came at us and said no we think you should do more ultimately the county commissioners",

        "text": "ay we'll begin. My name is Clinton Thomas Hamilton. My address is 12501 Southwest 27th Avenue. I'm one of the pieces that's at the top between this sub element and the Florida greenway. Okay, let's see here. You can sign in after you start. Okay, we're going to turn the green light on now. Okay. All right, I'm in favor of this project. I've attended the meeting before. I've spoken to these people, and yeah, that's my property right there. And they have worked with me. They've made concessions for us. They have listened to our needs. When I bought this property, I was not, I was aware of the fact that the property surrounding me was all zoned b one. So I knew it was going to be some kind of business thing, not residential. And I'd much rather surrounded by warehouses personally than residential property because I think I'll have less problem with the businesses that are around me. And I have green buffers all around my property because I like my privacy. And like I said, I plan on having horses and things out there. And it's a nice, quiet place. And I don't think that the businesses are going to be any worse than the interstate right now, which is not bad. I really hope that this gets approved. Like I said, I think these people are honest, genuine people. They, they've taken everything I've brought to their attention. The only thing I'm a little bit concerned about is I don't want to wind up with county water systems. We've got our own wells there and I'm hoping we can maintain that. But that's my only real concern right now. Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna. You can sign in. I'm going to surrender the rest of my time. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hi, my name is Rick Spade. I live 3087 Southwest 126 Lane Road. I have no idea how to run your marker thing. I didn't mean either. And I, so I just seen somebody squiggling around. He had it my property intersects at the very end of southwest 29th Av. He's pulling it up y and in that very corner there. My concern is there at the very corner of the house where it goes into the greenway. What their intentions are of. Right there is my house. My intentions are of how much traffic we have. I worked down at Coleman Federal prison with my friend Michael Carmack, and we sit in traffic every day, 1520 minutes to try to get out there. So I don't see what throwing two lanes of traffic behind that industrial complex is going to serve. With the way 484 tore up right now, it's almost impossible to make a left and go out to 75. The way it sets now with traffic at 06:00 in the morning, I couldn't even see adding this kind of three and a half million square foot. They had a tax break the whole time as agriculture, where I never got that break and now all of a sudden, business is boom and we're going to turn into a big commercial property when there's money be made. I see it down at Coleman the way it is with the villages taken over. They think they're going to run the largest federal correctional complex out of the country and they're building all around just like they're going to trap us in. I mean, it's crazy of what they're doing, just doing around. People don't have a say, but everybody'bought homes down there. Had no idea that this was going to come in. We would have been at the first one if we would have known anything other than a shingle was put up in some dirt. Said there's going to be a meeting and nobody read it because the sign was this big. So being aware of it, I am fully opposed to it. Thank you. ##icone please. Good evening, I'm Mike Carmack at my address is 4861 Southwest 151st Place. I have been a resident of Marion Oak since 20. Well, I purchased my house in 2016, moved in 2017. I started out at FCC Hazelton and like my friend Rick Spade said that I do work with him at FCC Coleman and I do see the negative effects of industrialization. I moved into my property seeing how it was a residential area, nice, wide open spaces, and I understand business has to go on. I do think that as far as the traffic's concerned, it's only getting worse. I don't see how putting a $3.6 million warehouse system right there at the entrance to 75 is going to alleviate that problem. I only see it exacerbating it. And personally, just going from I've lived in Orlando, every industrial park I've ever seen is not picturesque. To me, it seems like property values go down and crime goes up. So I am fully opposed to this. I think that in our county there are probably other suitable locations for that where you have solutions for traffic and you can keep business going, things like that. But I think it's a terrible idea to put it there. And I don't believe that many people would have moved in this area had they known this was going to be something coming along. Thank you. Thank you. Does anybody else want to come up before I close the public portion? Mister? Good. Do you want to come back up and address and we'll close the public portion? We're here just on the agreement. We're not here on the project, but some of their comments related to traffics, I think that's fair for them to bring that up. And I'm going to get Amber to address in terms of the use. This part of Marion Oaks, unit Seven was always intended for commercial industrial development. In fact, there were some deed restrictions that were recorded that prohibited anything except businesses going there. Now, in fairness to the people, they actually didn't allow, some of them didn't allow industrial, they required retail and stuff like that, and we got those removed. But this area has always been non residential, a non residential part of Marion Oakakes. And so that was, I mean, that sense, they designed it in terms of the ag classification. I sympathize with him. We're not Deltona, though. They put Deltona in our name because that's who we bought it from. That's to identify. My client bought it from Deltona and paided a pretty printing for it. We didn't get the benefit of any of those ad classification things. Amber, would you come talk about two things. One is the intersection improvements, particularly at 29th, that we're proposing, and also how much of our truck traffic is designed to go out 29th Avenue as opposed to the new road being built. Hello. Good evening. Amber Gartner with Kimley Horn'seventeen hundreds Southeast 17th Street ##eE 200 of Cala Florida 34471. I conducted the traffic impact study for the project, and those conclusions helped formulate the recommendations that are within our concurrency agreement that is before you this evening. So the subject improvement that I think will provide the most benefit to the residents who live along that corridor in that roadway is installing a traffic signal at the terminal of 29th Avenue Road and County Road 484. So today, the biggest trouble that they have is they can't turn left because the traffic on County Road 484 is so busy, there's no opportunity to get onto County Road 484. So this provides a safe option for them to be able to get in and off of the roadway. In addition, we are four leaning 29th Avenue Road. So that can provide an alternate means of travel for those residents as well as others in the Marion Oaks community, and also will allow for that safe movement to get from 29th onto County Road 484 with the traffic signalization. The other improvements that we are making are at our current entrance, that is at 20th Avenue Road. All these sound the same. I know it's confusing at times. So the entrance that goes into our current facility, that's under const construction. We will also be making additional improvements there to help traffic come in and out of our site, as well as what we'll call that loop road that could provide another alternate travel. With those improvements, we expect that a majority of our truck traffic is going to use that primary intersection at 20th. It's closest to the interstate. We're setting up that intersection to have the movements appropriate to accommodate the truck traffic coming in and out, and that will be the preferred route for the truckers. The secondary access ono 29th is really for our workforce. We know that for this type of facility, the workforce is targeted towards that local area. And so that would provide an opportunity for the workers at the facility to be coming through that secondary entrance on 29th. You putting a traffic light at 20th also? There's currently one there today, and we're making improvements there. So right now can show us 20th ma, please. That's the firstct takes you down to where summer Glenn is located. That signal is currently in place today. So is there by the McDonald's, right? Yes, it's a little. Yeah, a little down from it, but yes, Burger King. The Burger King is on the. Yes, it's where Burger King is. So we're building a new north part of that intersection, and that will go into our site as well as continue north and west over to. You can see this is a good exhibit. Marion Oaks Trail. Press the middle. I think Chris is doing that. Oh, Chris. So that, yes, that will provide a loop as well as options to continue farther west on Marion Oaks trail over to Marion oaks s course and then 49th. Yep. And I think one of the things that supports Amber",

        "text": " logistics uh I'm not sure if it would be useful just to do a show of hands or thumbs up just you know our folks on board with those those two basic parameters uh General concerns about tolling but if there is tolling we support the 400% Ami provisions and then I do agree that getting into the methodology might make it quite complicated so maybe just sticking to those higher level uh talking points might be the best way to go at this point all right so is everyone in agreement on those the first two bullet points Joy hands Yep looks like it all right excellent I think we have enough to work with thank you all right thank you everyone sure uh that brings us to item C which is jur jurisdictional updates so we haven't done this in a while and we sent an email was sent out last week hopefully you saw it giv each City about two minutes worth of time to let us know what's going on in your uh City and it doesn't have to be Transportation related it could be anything that's going on you think of his importance that you can cover in two minutes and so what I'll ask Stephen to do is we'll do alphabetically uh like kind of like we did roll call and I'll let Stephen start off I assume that would be Banks leading off I was just gonna suggest uh chair if I could I know mayor Callaway needs to step away at one and mayor Lenahan so I wonder if we might give them difference to go first and then sounds good okay I'll let you arm wrestle for who goes first right I defer to the mayor uh ladies first I'm glad you said age instead of saying age before Beauty thanks um yeah I'll be quick less than two minutes but um so our um fuel taxes have definitely you know a couple years ago during the pandemic we put um you know a three cent gas tax on the ballot and it passed surprisingly um but it passed and um so the fu taxes actually have definitely rebounded since the pandemic in North plains and so we're definitely um in you know seeing more uh uh funds come in that way which has been nice um and then I guess my question to this group and you can certainly email me or call me take it offline whatever but I would just be curious to know what's been what it has been like in other cities and then also um what other um community ities are considering alternative Revenue measures for for um with them more EVS uh coming online so i' kind of I wanted to throw those two questions out there just to see if I could get um you know some feedback from all of you and again feel free to email me or call me or text me or whatever um one of our biggest things that we're doing right now is um we will be doing our comp planning um for our ugb expansion in December um we're waiting on a few things um one of them being uh TGM Grant um but that is really big on our plate right now uh so that's where a lot of our focus is um other than that we're just sliding getting ready for the winter and um you know chili cook off and all those kind of social things Community things are happening of course but uh I know our staff is just really working pretty hard hard and diligently on on the ugb right now so that's it and I think that was under two minutes thank you here callway thank you um so I I would say you know one of our biggest jurisdictional challenges is probably you know what is being done outside of our jurisdiction and the impact that it's having inside and um you I think you know I was reminded of that today when we did a ribbon cutting you know for a joint project between the county and the City and the important role that MTI played in bringing that project to fruition and so I just you know I'm gonna say one of our biggest challenges is for me and I think also for you is protecting mtit um I know at a at one of the at the a recent border County Commission meeting um a short fall in I think with the jail and with it you know which is probably 20 25 million the suggestion was made to take msep money and apply it to those two projects which is absolutely the wrong use of msti and while it may be legal um because it's in the general fund I would argue that it's unethical and against the spirit of the voters who approved it time and time again which is why it's in the general fund so um that is uh so I'm just gonna stick with that one um if people want to hear more jurisdictional challenges in Hillsboro the number two one would probably be the mayor and then after that everything pales by comparison so with that I will uh yield my time back to the chair all right thanks Steve all right so Stephen I guess we'll start with ro and it'll be mayor Jones and Banks correct I usually start things off so um in the past six months we have updated and approved three of our big Master plans and so this coming month we are voting on SDC charges which we're looking to increase in some cases double and some cases not quite double um but we're we've had one development application no we don't have any applications yet we have a development agreement that has been signed and we see another one in the near future so we're just getting ready for uh some pretty significant housing increases in Banks and the other thing that has been on everyone's mind is safety we had a child killed in their neighborhood hit by a car um so that is very much on mind and the reactions of people of well it must be the speed limit and it it was not speed so trying to work through those emotions at the same time is making sure yes we have to go through every process because we can't just unilaterally reduce the speed limit somewhere without doing all the studies first and that's really hard for people to understand so so there's the city of banks um I will I'm going to put in a plug though my daughter is in a heart production of susal the musical it is fabulous it's the next three weekends I highly recommend everyone buy tickets to this right and if you do you may see me and my wife in our grandkids it's so much fun I'm I'm I'm in the costume committee I'm having a blast so yeah in the audience not in the play I want to make sure Stephanie you know that I yeah we're not expecting you to step step up Steve all right uh looking at the screen I believe mayor Batty's up next I'm shocked that another mayor is overly involved in something else and on a committee to help do other things I I I see you and I feel you which is why every time I leave the house my husband tolds me not to volunteer for something else um well I think like what's relevant to this group is we're working on a tsp update and we're working you know we're involving staff from neighboring jurisdictions beend is surrounded by some of our our awesome Partners so what we do impacts everyone else we're going to be one of the first cities to apply the new CC rules um and new ways to approach uh engagement and help reach diverse communities I think that's really important we we are actively working on two mstep funded projects the Milan Way Extension and the deny Road um you know we have a council Retreat coming up in November transportation is something my Council wants us to work on all the time but obviously funding is a huge piece of that um so those are kind of the big areas that we're working on and definitely want to to take the moment to congratulate the city of tiger and mayor Lube on their um awesome award this weekend from the street trust and some of the work that they're doing so we have a lot to learn from each next up I'm looking here ABC mayor Delan delaye there we go thank you um I would remiss not to start with safety as the first item so um on the safety front it's the fire Levy for us that's the and that is multi-jurisdictional right because every time something happens in our community if it's an RS or Forest Groves or Hillsboro OR North Plains or down in Gaston um Cornelius fire roles um so we are in the process this next month we'll have a out of cycle fire Levy vote um to basically substantially increase our fire Levy so we can maintain Staffing and equipment so that's a big deal coming through so I'm encouraging everyone to vote on that and uh it will be um we'll have to figure something out if it doesn't pass but I'm sure it'll pass it passed by previous ones passed at 70 and 80% so I'm sure we'll get the message out and people understand tying back into our traffic discussions and our our regional stuff um free and reduced lunch something struck me uh because we were talking about that as a pre-qualification to give you an idea I'm not sure what your communities are like I can't know everybody's demographics basically all of our elementary schools have free breakfast and free lunch um for the same thing that Tim talked about that basically once you get up into the higher percentages it doesn't make sense to administrate it so my entire community is uh for all the grade schools because all we have is grade schools is free and reduced lunch for breakfast and lunch so it gives you kind of an idea what our communities dealing with on income and transportation and then to touch on the uh previously mentioned one about EVs and how do you charge EVS um I think that's really talking to our State Rep when um Susan mlan our State Rep came and did her presentation to us I I leaned in really hard and said you know as we move away from gas taxes our major for form of local and state and County funding I think you can't forget that a lot of our communities do have local gas taxes we have a couple cents North Plains has three you know all throughout the state there's a lot of communities that have these and as we move to something which they're probably looking at a VMT we need to make sure that we continue to get that revenue for us right we need to have the the replacement system as part of the Inception and I think the the one I see is as people talk to me about this we're already up to registration fees that are much higher on EVS or hybrid",

        "text": " functionally in in the final order council did not assert jurisdiction under and finding compliance with the forest Practices Act but the certificate holder nonetheless needs to comply for the applicable provisions of the four of the FPA so here's this is just a little blurb like you know we you know we we reference and we talk about it under land use and public services the context of Public Services was cut was related to a fire player in in those areas but basically Council does not assert jurisdiction of the FPA and refers the applicant to submit its request for exemption directly to odf the Oregon Department of Forestry and so here down here in this footnote making you everybody get real squinty here okay as detailed in this order the applicant recommends and Council adopts various conditions related to compliance with FPA so related to compliance with the requirements would minimize potential impacts underneath applicable Council standards but Council imposing such conditions is not intended to assume enforcement authority over those requirements but rather Council finds compliance with FPA would reduce potential impacts underneath public services or it says protected areas but in land use so another example of this is Council has conditions that say and the certificate holder will build and construct and operate the transmission line consistent with nerc standards right count right and it's a represented well some of that comes from council's mandatory conditions but there's also these representations from the certificate holder that says hey we're gonna we're going to maintain the standard Council doesn't have your not saying well we are going to go out and we're going to enforce nerk standards but it's more of a representation so that's kind of aligning here so now I'm going to go back to those uh the certificate holders responses and the comments so that said because we know that there was a lot said about Forest Practices Act the certificate holder which also they kind of reroute which we hadn't really raised that we specifically address in the in the second amended project order FPA requirements and which that's the document that says hey these are the applicable rules to your facility and there we kind of reroute them and direct them to odf as well so that said I'm not going to go through these now Idaho Power gives more you know they kind of entertain and provide responses oh I guess the one aspect of their response I do want to say down here okay roads okay so consistent with land use condition for Idaho Powers coordinating with odf to ensure that all project related roads and Forest lands will be constructed in upgraded consistent with the FPA it includes this plan for alternate practice um and we'll finalize the plan and so they're working on it and they're working with odf and W on that council member Devlin has a question I the comments uh that were provided by b2h uh I frankly just assumed you know that what I say it as the energy facility citing Council there are going to be a lot of things the like the forest Practices Act where the applicant is going to have to comply with if they've become under that act if they take any action that's under that act they're going to have to comply with state law in that case if they have to uh have any fill and removal permits they're going to have to go to DSL and get those they're going to have to transport a lot of materials to build this so they're going to have to comply with all ODOT requirements and you could probably just develop a very long list of these and it wouldn't be something that we would have actually in the order it would just be assumed and I think expected that an applicant would comply with all other applicable requirements and it could be a very long laundry list to be quite honest of course you're going to apply all OSHA requirements for all of your workers so that's that um that's a very uh good good comment councilman member Devlin and I know that you're you're um you you weren't here for the the final decision on the application so you're probably relatively new to the project but that is kind of the intent of um the council's Consolidated review um so it's interesting that you met mentioned removal fill the removal fill permit is actually under council's jurisdiction so so Council actually did make a decision on the removal fill um so but it's interesting because it's like there's some it's whether or not a permit is ministerial um is one of kind of like those thresholds on whether or not it would be appropriate to be under council's um it kind of is uh up to what the applicant proposes right um because uh you know it's like applicants can somewhat opt for the Consolidated review or go seek out their permits elsewhere however ODOT is an external permit that they would never nonetheless need to comply with and get their permits from ODOT um comply with OSHA standards Etc yes there's probably a long list yes uh yeah so that said um I'm not going I'm just I'm not going to go over any more of the uh the forest Practices Act comments or responses and these are um I would say stop b2h they do identify Miss Gilbert's um comments in here too however I think that there's a overlap in those and the the response I just provided about the FPA would apply to stop b2h and to miss Gilbert's um is Council comfortable with that because there's um I think that gets us to page um page eight of their responses please do council member bear so we've received these comments and in the proposed order is is there a subsection where you respond to comments or is it in the background section where we can at least provide the language you just provided about not having jurisdiction over the force under the forest Practices Act just to be crystal clear and not give an opening for a contested Case by us not being responsive does that make sense yeah absolutely um so there's one to the proposed order we attach all the DPO comments and responses so they're attached to the proposed order but that said what we normally do is provide and what we'll probably do is not you know we could actually just provide this whole table in the document we'll we'll probably generalize will probably generate and include in the front end of the document a boiled down version of this and that's traditionally what we do so and so and so commented super summery um no changes made to the proposed order and if there was a change to the proposed order that table will route you there and then in that section where there is a change we'll also like footnote kind of explain what that change is so yeah I know we've seen that kind of reference and staff reports I just didn't know if it showed up in the final order and that's perfect that yeah in the proposed order thank you and it'll all those they'll be and they'll be in track changes so they'll be in red font so it'll be easy to kind of scroll through not only for council members but but the kind of the idea of the next task and not to you know jump ahead but right we talked a lot about um you know the the opportunity to request a contested case right like the idea is that you raise comments or issues on the draft proposed order There's an opportunity for the certificate holder to respond for Council to respond for us to respond the proposed order is that response we show what we what we did and then if a individual who commented on the DPO and met all the the criteria to proceed with a contested case request then they're saying well you know this this is still why my comment is was not addressed or right like this is why like there's still an outstanding issue that would uh necessitate you know litigating in a contested case yes thank you for the question all right so now we're going to move on to the Oregon Trail these are comments um raised by OCTA the Oregon uh California Trails Association so I think that these were provided to council a little bit more in advance than some of the other comments I'm just going to what I did here is kind of to guide our review is I highlighted because it's interesting um OCTA kind of made a comment but then like had a question so um which is a little bit weird in the process of like how do you I'm answering your question but it's weird with the process so what I want to do here is I'm kind of focusing on what their question is and then pointing to where the certificate holder's answer was even though there's more embedded information which is generally associated with the location of where that answer is so that's just what I was going to go over today so uh so OCTA points out this one um Road segment and then they're asking have archaeological studies been conducted and the certificate holder says yes the in this area of the direct analysis area right so that the site boundary have been complete no new Oregon Trail segments identified um and then the report for the surveys for the have been um completed through um these are provided as rfa1 but they're also all of all of this documentation that they talk about related to cultural um is also get getting circulated through the section 106 process right so it's it's going through and just as a very high level summary of what council um affirmed the position they would take with respect to uh historic cultural and archaeological resources um right so generally speaking under sub a of that standard what council looks at are resources that are eligible or likely eligible to the National register of historic places or the nrhp okay now the outcome of the federal section 106 are determinations yes eligible no not eligible and what council decided to do is to wait for the outcome of that and when those determinations start coming out for all of these resources that are in these very long tables for Council there those that those are going to be functionally trued up based on the section 106 process so that said kind of going back to here Idaho Idaho power is out they're doing surveys of new areas these new areas we're seeing in rfa1 they're also as they gain access to some properties they're doing archaeological surveys on those properties um that have already that are associated with the approved route but for pre-construction so there's a lot of stuff going on out there and it's you know there's a lot of moving pieces but the whole proposal is and and the you know the kind of the important part and I think I highlighted it down here is that really kind of the phase two is once they gain access like basically uh 100 of the site boundary will be will be surveyed",

        "text": " the decision making record staff would then have to keep track of that make sure they got into the record and also allow the applicant to respond to those comments we have a process that's in place right now for comments Project Specific comments there are two opportunities one is through the when the the notice intent is issued the public is given an opportunity those comments are made part of your decisionmaking record and then of course on the draft proposed order public comments Project Specific comments are made part of the record the applicant is given an opportunity to respond staff evaluates and provides you their input uh there is nothing in your rules that requires separate comments made uh comments made separately to you or comment made during the course of a public meeting one of your regular meetings that requires you to make those part of the decision making uh I want to point out that Oregon public meetings Law requires that the public be able to observe and monitor public meetings there's nothing in Oregon public meetings law that requires you to accept public comments during a meeting you have a rule FC itself has a rule that says during a public meeting you will take comments from the public uh of matters of concern except for those matters that are closed that you have indicated in the notice are closed to public comments so the practice has been once a matter goes into contested case we indicate in the notice you're no longer accepting comments on that matter even during a public meeting we haven't done that uh for matters that are just open that for projects for which there's an application but have yet to go to public comment people can come in and provide comments on those projects the question is whether or not those comments are made part of the decisionmaking record meaning the record that the staff considers when they're preparing a d and that you ultimately consider when you're making your decision M there's nothing that would require you to make such comments that are that are made during one of these meetings that are made separately to you part of that decision-making record and as I mentioned just a moment ago it would be problematic to do so from a fairness standpoint for the applicant and from an administrative standpoint for staff thank you record um so just question from The public's point of view um what then is the purpose it's not part of the record uh what's the purpose of the public com a portal provide public or I guess it's unclear to me take a step sure um so for the than you counc I think I want to make sure that we're talking about the same thing so there is public comment period during a council meeting that's where you know outside of a contested case looking for right information it's a public meeting you notice public meeting taking minutes we recording it um something comes in we notify an applicant certificate holder hey we got a public comment on your project you might want to be aware of this that's different than the public comment portal and the two comment time frames associated with an active project Patrick just talked about at the notice of intent stage at the dra propos order stage we have specific timelines we send out the notice we indicate what the time frame is within which to provide comment and the methods by which to provide comment which also includes the public comment for that is only active for a project during those time frames people can't go to the public comment portal and simply provide a public comment on a project that's not an opportunity there is they have to go into the public comment portal choose the project and then comment on that project if project is out not within a public comment period there is no way to provide comment on the portal for that project okay um sorry I just make sure I understand this so if I I have a comment to make on a project that and I'm coming through the portal I choose to make my comment is that part of is that comment part of okay so when we when we provide notice there's an open public comment period really people can provide comment in many different ways they can send us an email they can mail us a physical copy of their comments they can go into the public comment portal they can provide a fact they can show up at any kind of public hearing associated with that and provide oral comments there's numerous ways that people can provide comments but outside of that comment period before it starts and after it ends those they're all the same you can't provide comment I mean they might they might submit comments two days before or two days after that's not a public comment associated with that comment period so the public comment portal you know activates and deactivates during that time frame somebody can always submit a handwritten letter to us afterward and we're going to say that's not part of the decision record as Patrick was talking about because that was submitted outside of the public comment and is the public aware of that like is there respon very we try to be very explicit that your time frame to submit comments during the notice of intent period during the draft proposed order are within these dates and here are the ways within which you can provide comment right but so if somebody does provide comment and you know not familiar with the timing um and they provide comment that it's not it's outside of the period do they receive a response that says I'm sorry you know thank you yeah we the so at the last meeting we talked about the the various comments that came in we have responded to all of those um people letting them know that you know submitted your comments outside of a public comment time frame we've provided these to the um we provided these to all council members however you're not consider part of record please let us know if you would like to have a conversation so we can help you better understand how our process works how to work within it um what to look at how to participate all of those things thank you council member so just to confus if somebody comes and Prov public comments clearly on the agenda saying won't take public comments on these projects because the record is closed but there's probably that gray area between when the comment period on the notice inent closes before the draft order issued and another period St where somebody put conceivably come offer comments on the project and still in the process those comments would not be part of the decision record but there could be an opportunity for that individual to come under public during public and that would be part of Rec so even though we hear testimony um dur the public comment period on a particular project not part of the decision record unless it's prescri period That's thank you looking at the screen council member counc CH everybody did there thumbs counc com thank you for providing such Clarity I apprciate um and the last update uh is bway amendment number one um and The Challenge on the denial the cont case I'll turn that over to Mr you an update last month uh that in that matter was uh filed in Union County Circuit Court and that we intended to we had filed a motion to transfer to the Supreme Court that motion has been denied so for now it stays in Union counc Circuit bu um just a quick question we um got the link to the Supreme Court on the project any IDE decision there I can't remember the time they had to decide yeah theet um the Supreme Court has six months within which two reach its final decision and I believe that time of filing or is that the time of uh six months from when the petition was petition for review was filed right now I can't recall my head when that petition was filed I want to say was wrong early theal arum was January right so it might it might have been early December right it might have been early December probably ability is a reminder the Forman Hemingway project um you know which was quite voluminous and complex they issued their final decision in four months so I that means they issue this decision you know in less than six months but um I think again going back to how our process works is you know that it gets refined along the way from the notice of intent to the draft proposed order you know all the way through contested case in the final order that there is a good clear clean record that's the design that the Supreme Court then has all of that information um that's well articulated and that's the design is to allow them to be able to have all that information with which to make a relatively decision thank you um Nancy can you forward the slide please okay see that um very well so uh you know it's not every council meeting but when there is some incident or significant compliance activity provide you that update so we did receive uh earlier this month from the big low Canyon Wind Farm a incident notification so they um found a broken bearing blade bearing bolt at the base of a particular wind turbine and um they notified us within the time frame after the incident so that was spond um they tested all the bolts on that particular wind turbine they all passed and just as a reminder this was an issue where we've had you know elements with the big cany wind farm wind turbin um we had other issues with bolts and and other things falling off the wind turs um but they currently have a monitoring protocol which on an annual basis they will go out and check all the these same FS on every single winter so you know in this case you know not afraid that the B fell down but you know what are the what are the followup activities and that's I think Where It's always important what do we do now they already have a protocol place um is it was previously every four years now it's every year so we concluded that there is no additional followup that's needed they recorded it timely they already have an annual protocol for testing those so for us that was sufficient to to move forward and conclude this incident okay moving on to we are currently in the short legislative session so uh we talked previously about three bills that relate to the energy facility sighting Council House Bill 415 um that proposes to add a definition of battery energy storage systems in fex definitions so as you recall we have numerous projects where the council has reviewed uh and approved battery storage but those are in conjunction with a wind or Soler or natural gas facility um so they're not by themselves so currently there is no definition of battery energy storage whether it's in FX statutes or when in conservation development commission statutes or anywhere we know there needs to be you know a lot more battery storage systems out there and the market is such that we're going",

        "text": ". Okay. Motion for the developers agreement by commissioners. They like seconded by commissioner Stone. Any comments in favor? Say ay. Aye. Ayeosee like sign. Motion passes unanimously. So we're done with that one. Yep. It was three one, so. 1540 115. 424344. I think the best thing to do, since we're all interrelated, is take them together, and then we'll come back to 15 4.1, which requires. I've handed this out to the board. Requires three separate motions. So, Belton, if you want to start. Yes. Thank you. Commissioner Elton Holland, county engineer. This is a public hearing to consider adoption of resolution to vacate portions of the Platte of Marion Oak unit seven as recorded in platbook o, pages 140 to 153, and a resolution to close and abandon that certain portion of Southwest 27th Avenue. And do we have proof of publication for this? Yeah. Thank you. So the portion of unit seven that is being vacated is outlined in red, and. Hold on. Can everybody hear him? It would be helpful you spoke up. Just. I can do. Okay. If you need hearing assistance, we have those. I forgot to mention that. If you want them, just raise your hand, and I'll have a staff member come to you. But, Elton, if you can elevate a little bit. Yes, sir. That'd be good for all of us. So the portion of the Platt that is being vacated is illustrated and outlined. And it has. There are portions that have been assembled by TDC Deltona, and the segment of 27th that runs through is a segment that was, was deeded outside of that plai. And that segment is illustrated again in this hatched area. So an overview of the project. An overview. Got it. So an overview of the project shows those properties combined and running through the middle is the deeded portion of 27th. So TDC has assembled properties and have an industrial development programmed. And in order, in order to vacate these properties, the vacation must not negatively impact the access to adjacent properties or properties other than those being vacated. So an agreement has been developed and has been reviewed for the purpose of managing that access. It also manages the utilities that service those parcels, as well as stormwater associated with road improvements through the development. So with that, in this particular action, we must have public comment. So we must allow for a time for public comment. We do have to have three separate actions. And as mentioned, it sounds like we're going to go ahead and have some presentation by staff as well as well as the applicant related to the particulars of the project. We'll just move through them and then we'll have public comment on the entire block. Okay, so with that, I, I would turn discussion over to Mister Ron to discuss from growth services. Yeah, does this hearing have to be closed out or we just can move forward? I think you can move forward, but as you said, you have to have a separate vote on each one of these. Ro ##eah we'll do that. Mister chair, before Elton leaves, can we go back to the proposed project map right there? And I don't know if you can enhance that any for those that are in the audience. And it sounds like from what I picked up, some people losing their access. And could you just use your pointer to kind of highlight where a new roadway is going to be for them to have access to their property? Yes. So this is 27th Avenue and that is the deeded roadway. Does it does serve this area. So this roadway and part of why this roadway agreement was developed, this section of road will be constructed by the developer and will be deeded to the county for our county use and maintenance. It'll connect 484 through over to Maryion Oaks Trail, but these properties will be afforded access. The developer will also be constructing an access along the backside which comes back to what is what remains, deeded access along this side. So they will have constructed and civilized access. It'll be a public access eas, but all the way to their properties. Okay. They won't have to move any of the. Or anything like that. This will not cost them anything. That is correct. Okay. You can't talk. Can't. We've got certain. Yeah. Well, we have to have all the comments on the record, so we can't have comments from the audience, but you'll have an opportunity to come up, mister chair, do we want to go ahead and take public comment on the public hearing before we move into the other portion of it? We can do it any way y'all want to. I just recommended one. What? Jimmy. He'd rather it do. He said he'd rather hear the whole thing. We'll give y'all information that's relevant to that point in connection with our presentation. It's a very big, complicated package based on that. That's why I wanted. Let's just deal with the roadway right out of the gate. So we know that there is going to be a proposed constructed roadway for those to be able to have access to their property, and it's not going to cost them anything. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. And that will occur for both temporary access during construction of the development. And once the development is complete, then the temporary access for both the roadways and the utilities will be addressed. Okay. So at no point during the project will they lose access. That's right. Okay, so that's 14. 4.1. You move into 14.4.215. I. So I am. And I will turn and Chris will be taking thatart. Chris reing with the gross services department following up for our requests. These will be three separate items. One is a comprehensive plan amendment. The next item is a rezoning for a pud. And then the final item is a development agreement for improvements related to the overall comprehensive amendment on the PUDZ resulting classification. Ultimately, the project's been referenced under transesterern north. It's also been referred to as Trailhead north, which is a proposed commerce park located in the northwest quadrant of the I 75 and Highway 44 interchange to the north of an existing commerce park. Overall, it does the join portions of the Marion Oaks urban area. It's located and includes a portion of the Marion Oaks Special business area. It is south. To the southeast is the Marco Polories Commerce park. To the southwest is the remaining portion of the Marion Oaks Special business area. Overall, the site is approximately 228 acres. The ultimate request is for the whole property to be designated employment center, which is a mixed use residential and commercial and light industrial land use. However, the PE is proposing 3.6 million commercial industrial distribution warehouses. There is a chapter 163 agreement proposal for a development agreement to go with it. And this does represent infill within the Marion Oaks development, which is a historic project that was initially established a number of years ago. This is an increased aerial of the site. This reddish line that you kind of see here identifies the existing limits of the Marion Oak unit seven area east of what is Southwest 29th Avenue Road. This, for reference, is the Ocalon RV resort. And this is the Marco Polo Industries'commerce park. And actually trans Western is building inside that pud over 900,000 square foot industrial development building right here today, overall. And that building is located roughly right in here. This is the proposed site. This is the remainder of the special business area. And this is the Merle Polries'Commerce Park. P. It is both the north and south sides of Highway 44. Just to give you a quick reference, this is part of the overall Marion Oaks master plan community as well for portions of it. It's located up in here in this region. The project was actually created in 19, 73, 50 years ago this year, and it consists of approximately 26 sq. Mi total, 28,000 residential units along with associated designated commercial properties, school sites, utilities, and so on. Today, there are just over 9000 houses in it. They're about 25% of the way. And at this point, there are only approximately 37 multifam family sites, typically duplexes, triplexes or quads. No actual apartment complexes today. And right now, technically, we have 25 commercial sites. Existing uses within this surrounding area. Of course, this is the RV park. This is the outlet mall shopping center complex. This is listed as single family because there's an old house sitting on this property right now. But just to give your bearing, this is the O'Reilly auto parts. This is the new transesterern building. These are the existing neighbors that are here in the audience, for instance. And of course, these are portions of Marion Oaks to the west on the western side of southwest 29th Apenny Road. The comprehensive plan amendment deals with a series of parcels which are dras or buffer tracks, and then these two rural land parcels which are being converted to the employment center to form the cohesive site. Ultimately, it will all be employment center, which is consistent with the other land uses throughout the employment center. For staff's proposal, it is compatible with the surrounding uses. It will not adversely affect the public interest. It is consistent with the comprehensive plan, and its consistent was chapter 163. So staff is recommending approval of the comprehensive plan amendment. Now, if you've got questions, I can stop for a second. Moving on for the Pud rezoning. Again",

        "text": "okay well let's get started welcome to the august 18th meeting of the oregon global warming commission it's not the july 13th didn't fix the headline there today we are going to be going over our two main projects that we're currently working on uh first to get an update and look at the scenarios and some of the financial metrics and a sneak peek at the co-benefits work for oregon's roadmap to after the presentation which will include some clarifying questions we will open it up for public comment the public will be welcome to comment on anything that's on our agenda or anything they want to bring before the then we'll take a short break and come back and have a commission discussion on the work that's been done specifically on the work we present and then the last

i'll ask linda to remind people how they can raise their hand for public comment and to make perfect comments to the i just wanted to acknowledge the significance of the inflation reduction act that was signed into law on tuesday and the significant opportunity that it for both of the topics that we're going to be discussing today um the work because of the investments across all sectors including national and working lands that that that bill will uh that act will will have uh that and the support it'll provide to states uh towards meeting their client mitigation goals so i'm really excited to see that and i think it makes me feel more confident the work the potential to achieve the goals that we're discussing so very excited about that i wanted to um also as an update uh thank wendy who has been supporting the commission this summer as the department of energy recruited for maya's replacement and i just want to thank wendy for stepping in and really helping out i wanted to thank the department for the speed at which and the great work that the department did in recruiting maya's replacement who has joined us today zach baker is um will be helping the commission as part part of his duties and i'm just thrilled to have him uh on board to support the commission and and the department of energy more broadly alan did you want to say anything or do should i just pass it

wait to work with you in this role and uh for those who i haven't met yet i'm really looking forward to meeting and working with you i've worked in the climate and clean energy space for a while now at the local state and federal levels uh with the majority of that work in oregon most recently i was at the oregon public utility commission working on utility planning procurement and decarbonization including implementation of hpe 2021 the clean electricity bill and before that i worked for a northwest based nonprofit called climate solutions uh designing and advocating for state and local policies on climate and clean energy and in that role i had the privilege of serving on the rulemaking advisory committee for deq's climate protection and then i've also worked in the oregon legislature a staff to a state representative and served as a city councillor in fort valles oregon where i helped the city develop a climate action plan so definitely more to share uh but i'll leave my intro there for now and uh i'm really looking forward to supporting the work of the commission and um please don't hesitate to be in touch as we go and uh thanks yeah welcome zach it's really great to have someone with that diverse background so great to have you here let me just look at my notes and make um one thing i just wanted to mention i've been having challenges with my internet so if i disappear or so i can't see a slide i will it'll it'll pass soon and we can pick things back up and i appreciate understanding of that then i thought we would go ahead and take roll call and i will just go my screen and try and go down the list to um and have folks that you're here uh so representative brock smith yes here commissioner jackson directly director bateman and welcome thank you commissioner chippentower commissioner oh i don't think we could hear you cheryl we do that again we can't hear you so maybe um linda can work with you after we get through the roll call um to see if she can help you figure that i i was having trouble with that earlier today so i i understand the challenges commissioner ford i'm here good afternoon director benner i'm here nice to see everyone jumping over you guys are all jumping i'm commissioner after here good to see everybody director whitman here good afternoon everybody senator finley mr phillies president thank you commissioner patowski you are on you try to come off mute and say you're here it looks like commissioner patowski might be having some challenges as well my challenge is i didn't unmute sorry good afternoon and commissioner magnera uh present i think that concludes if i missed anybody that's on the commission i think i did so with that i will open it up to commissioners if you have updates that you want to share with the commission i would love to i'd love to hear hear those director benner yes chairman donald thank you um uh chair mcdonald asked me to share a little bit about the recent visit from us department of energy secretary jennifer granholm she was in portland on monday a week ago monday um to see some of the great things that our state is doing on climate change and some of the new technologies that we're pioneering that are going to help us with our clean energy transition so we started the at electric island the collaborative between daimler trucks and portland general electric we were joined by governor and the two senators it was a little bit of a victory lap on the inflation reduction act um but she uh the secretary got to drive one of the trucks it was pretty cool hear more about the the goals and the efforts of daimler which are pretty fantastic and and some of the work that the state is doing support that effort in the governor's remarks at the press event she mentioned the work that this commission is doing on the roadmap to 2035 and the analysis that um we talked about last time showing that uh we are that our goals are in reach um if we implement and fund the programs that are on the books and i thought she did a really good job of sort of taking a victory lap but also emphasizing the need to do the work that we say we're going to do and the importance of continuing to keep our our feet to the pedal on that one then we went south to wilsonville and visited a battery manufacturer called ess it's a long duration energy storage battery that doesn't use lithium and they are doing some really neat work there the senators were very excited about that and the potential to expand some of the work that's happening in that facility uh and then finally we went to oregon state university to see their wave technology center and learn more about the packwave project where they're actually starting to get some um well soon we'll be putting some of the wave energy devices in the water and hear about the um funding and um permitting successes they've had and there was a lot of interest from the secretary in the work that's happening at our universities so um thanks for the opportunity to share that i will just um share one other thing which is uh direct uh chair mcdonald mentioned the inflation reduction act and um that's really really exciting i just want to make sure people understand that at least for funding for energy the us department of energy has a lot of work to do to get money out the door from the the iija that is starting to come our way but you know it's it takes time um for them to sta they're having to staff up and get money out the door and then we'll have to staff up and get money out the door so i just want to make sure people understand that inflation reduction act money is great it's not coming yet it'll be um it'll be on its way you know soon but the i think one one great thing about both of those bills is that they are not um really focused on shovel-ready projects they're really focused on um supporting capacity and development and implementation of longer term plans so i oregon is very well positioned to receive a lot of funds in part due to the work that's been happening at this so i'm going to put in the um chat a link to the oregon department of energy's webpage on the infrastructure investment and jobs act which will you know update with information on the inflation reduction act as we get it but feel free to reach out if you have any questions sorry that was a long date thank you director benner that's great and i completely agree it will take time but knowing that it's a 10-year program it also provides that certainty to be able to kind of expand programs there are other updates that people commissioners want to make i'll just note that um suzanne carlson is here for representing and catherine williams is here representing northwest natural um and i don't know if uh mike is officially representing oregon department of agriculture but he's here um glad to have you join us and i'm trying to see who else might be in that same i think that might be it but um do uh catherine or suzanne do you have any updates you'd like to share kathy can you hear me this is catherine okay good sorry we've been working behind the scenes on",

        "text": " it's in the utilities interesting you can util you can get the utility to write the grant proposal but it really works it it really needs someone who is not uh distracted by other duties and it needs someone who can focus on those issues to do it so that I think there are opportunities in solar I think it's a good thing for us to continue to explore and find out the things that the city is already doing to learn what other cities might have and to identify some of the opportunities and then maybe we can have a two-way street through it's my goal with it Council task force and planning commission that I think this is one of those areas where we should try and figure out the best way to exercise our advisory capacity as well and utilize that too uh gather information and explore different options good point other yeah I have one more question for Rob sure I can wait if other so Rob given some of the financing challenges that people have right now and the administrative burdens uh that people are facing to install some of these projects do you have any experience of municipalities taking on a leadership role um and in leading this an effort like this so Salem were to say oh you know we we're in the middle of our resiliency plan and we decided that we really need to have five megawatts locally produced and stored um and we want to take the lead on that and develop that is that something that another city has done you know there have been some projects that have certainly had a strong Municipal component including many of the ones that are being funded in our community renewable energy grant program where Salem is already participating because they you actually have to be a public body just to apply for that one um but two that come to mind one is um Milwaukee and um I don't know how much Clackamas County is involved but Milwaukee has a similar vision for developing rooftop solar on a vast amount of warehouse I'm not sure how far they've gotten along at that path but it's certainly been something that's been discussed and then another one is the public safety center in in Beaverton or no maybe it's in Hillsboro um I think it's Beaverton Public Safety Center this is a uh a municipal building that has solar and storage um and it houses a lot of the emergency response capabilities for the community and so having the battery back up and the ongoing solar recharge of the most of these facilities are fitted with a diesel generator which is great you can serve a lot more load with the diesel generator than you can with a little bit of rooftop solar but in the event of you know a seismic um you know emergency or something like the the state's liquid fuels are likely going to be um really hard to distribute and so having a truly resilient recharge on that battery is something that's driving some of these so you know if Salem really took the reins and and did something at the municipal level I think you would likely kind of be leading the charge but you might look into what Milwaukee has been talking about for their um their rooftop plan thank you I don't have any other questions thank you Robin thank you other questions it's your fault thanks uh it's actually not a question it's more of a I guess amusing that uh we're talking a lot about solar specifically as one of the renewable um but what if this was essentially treated more in a resiliency manner as it relates to to getting these projects permitted because there's some way we can incentivize uh you know maybe there's an offset cost or something that you similar to if you have like STC credits for example uh if you you know are doing a demolition of a project and then coming back in with a remodel is there a way that we can kind of Bank um renewable and resilient strategies at the design side that can then offset in the construction on the construction side so that we can really start encouraging more development that that uses those strategies from the beginning rather than I mean I think solar rooftops is a fantastic idea depending on the you know the existing structure and what kind of solar your your implementing and you know there are a variety of factors that come into play and I think having those conversations is certainly in the design process as you can is really where the value is and if you know as a as an architect if we can you know be able to call the city and find out what those paths are that we can use as a as an opportunity that you know conversation that we can have with our clients to to encourage that approach I think there would be a lot uh interest maybe in in pursuing those because at the end of the day the spent desire would love to have all of my clients very happily charge forward into that's correct okay and maybe as an example of of our challenging approach but it is seeing results and there's a city in California that actually requires lead certified lead silver buildings um all commercial buildings and um which is fine as a prescriptive path but it the actual certification they required does create I think some Financial barriers that also May prevent people who are out you know less ability to to enact that that approach but if we can do it as I said in some way of offsetting uh you know in some in some way I think that would be any other questions for Rob words for Lisa thank you rob for joining us tonight great information and I really appreciate your time and most likely commissioner Slater will be back in touch with you thank you yeah thank you for having me and I know that um commissioner Slater and Shelby both have my contact information feel free to reach out at any time if there's additional questions thank you sir another comment or observation which may be wrong Lisa can correct me but you know Salem has done a resiliency with the public works program but my understanding of that is it came about in large part it's just by coincidental circumstance and then PGA was doing some resiliency work in a particular location that happened to be close to the public works department and I bring that up because it's it's something that happens by circumstances a great opportunity and it proceeded but things aren't going to be that easy those circumstances aren't always going to be there and as obvious as they were improved for that so well it's a great project and it worked out great I think it's important to recognize that it was it was just sort of something that came together by coincidental circumstances and not a fun really necessarily planned way ahead good observation any other comments before we move on in the agenda I would be interested in hearing commissioner Levine's thoughts in terms of just if you have any thoughts on where the market is or is the commercial building owners if they've been thinking about this or you're getting awareness of what might be on their minds I can give some input this goes back to uh 2008 2009 but I have had clients put solar on Industrial um and there's some uh logistical problems between utility companies and tenants paying for electricity and so if it's a building that you occupy for your own business it's very easy to then put solar on because you're recognizing that if you're talking about a building and owner who is renting out their building which a lot of those buildings on the GoPro start mentioning my attendance um how to uh as the owner of the building you invest in that solar get compensated for the electricity that's generated is not a very easy thing and at least full transparency PGE did not make it easy themselves and so the conversation between tenant landlord actually became somewhat contentious it if it wasn't for uh the federal dollars and as well as which was mostly tax incentives as well as the I believe it was a grant from Oregon Department of energy that was sponsored at that time the value in the payback on the system wouldn't have been there and so the system paid for itself by the incentives and the grants which luckily this particular property owner had some tax liabilities carrying forward that they were able to leverage and benefit from those but otherwise this system would not have penciled and to date uh the income from it um was uh such a problem with the tenant that it had been connected to that when the contract ended and the property owner could disconnect that solar they went and took it away from the tenants that he was feeding and they gave it to the non-profit organization that occupies space in the building because that was the cleanest simplest way to get some kind of income again they're taking it as a charitable donation but that tenant is willing to share their PGE bill which has to be recorded with the building owner CPA to show what that monthly donation value is so the the bookkeeping the logistics the whole there to do it on the private side of the meter just needs to be vetted more thoroughly for how something like that would work on a different scenario because a lot of the examples that you made were the McGill Crest area they're um to Pivot to something more Central like downtown buildings that are traditionally Office Buildings um you'll see a full service rent structure which includes the utility bills in those instances landlords that rent Office Buildings on a full-service basis could very well benefit from it and very easily benefit from it because they're the ones that simply pay the electric bill I happen to own a building just half a block from um and I have multiple tenants we have a large flat roof we have looked at the feasibility of what would that do as far as reducing uh what is effectively a thousand dollar a month electric bill for that building and the unless the department of energy brings back their grant program um just paying for the system for me as a very small investor would be two grades I would have to take out debt to put that system in to have something substantial enough of size that would generate a basically reducing electrical billing in total which is theoretically possible on that building and then just uh to note a building that I rebuilt on Capital Jefferson streets in 2009 we engineered the trusses for that building to hold solar it has a shed roof that is south facing with no tree we put conduit in for solar to be wired into the building we marketed the building as with a solar calculation from a provider that went with it and in I don't know 14 years of owning the building I've never once had a tenant take up the opportunity to engage in a solar project even though I had numbers that showed that if we put it on the building it would effectively",

        "text": " the Wildfire plan standards that were clear and why would require certain reviews how those are handled and tie them back to the risk factors and I'm comfortable with this one so just wanted to make that point because it did look like a slightly different condition than the other projects that we've seen and since these are new um I think we will try to address these on a project specific basis again I'm comfortable with that as long as we're making findings to reflect that I kind of Collins Hardy weather for the record I do want to note that the applicant did not propose the the five years that was a department recommendation as I'd rather than it was a little unclear well it was kind of through the review of that section I think that that was kind of what we recommended so it may have been in their application but it came through our review of that's what it came from the the department I think the applicant did there's a fairly low risk of wildfire and they've addressed the other factors so I would be comfortable in the final human being thank you other questions comments related to we needed additional information um accomplishment responded for the perfect City Condon because the Wildfire rules are so new and these are of course coming through I am very interested in that in the process of review and approval since we are in approval we're approving those plans um I'm I am interested in what that process is for an investigation you know have Stafford use the plans the expertise as as it's bracket Council in the future we don't have to necessarily talk about it now but um I think we'll learn a lot through this process and as each of these come through with different risk offenders and how those are assessed so yeah it's and I don't I have to didn't look it with him I didn't look at that I don't have the condition in front of me but the the intent and like in in my mind and like in the reading of the rule is that kind of the the information requirement and the application is like a baseline evaluation what does the site look like when when we're looking at it and then in the Wildfire mitigation plan because to me the standard reads and contemplates that wildfirevis is dynamic that's what it's trying to capture is that the landscape changes based on development climate change drought all of these assets and that's what we're trying to get snapshots on through time to see if what is being proposed at the site by the applicant and in inspections vegetation management Etc is is still adequate to adjust for pivot to any increase in Risk thank you and you know I think it'll be interesting when we yeah so when we um I think it'll be interesting when we do get one and have have updates about what that looks like great thank you all right other comments then let's get back to our studies story uh this is final order well Madam chair this is Kent yes sir I'm ready to I'm ready to make a motion if uh the rest of council's ready we are ready for what I can tell by the okay well I moved that the council approve the application for site certificate for the West End solar project based on the recommended findings of fact conclusions of Law and conditions of approval as presented in the proposed order and issue a final order and site certificate as presented and recommended by staff thank you do we have a second council member continent council member continent for the record and I sent it that thank you very much any further questions comments hearing none Mr secretary to please call the roll very chalk tube come back around Harry have we're going to come back to you so if we can pick you up and Byron yes Cindy Conan yes Richard Devlin Marcy Grail yes can how Jordan Truitt yes very chopkin 's um okay um councilmember Shopkin we're not able to hear you if you can hear us right now did one more call for the vote so if you can't hear us councilmember choctude please designate whether you've voted for or against the motion well there's enough for a permanent decision so okay I would say motion carries thank you Kellen as for your fairness in being engaging and uh if we acknowledge the applicant for uh their efforts in addressing our concerns and questions thank you for uh being a good participant in this process to council thank you for everyone's comments and as Patrick stated our ability to have things clear on our mindset will help everyone and along also thank you very much um I'm just going to look at Todd for explain the check we are doing great in my mind so uh agenda item C is our 2023 legislative session update this is an information item where we have Christine said the government relations coordinators who give us an overview of what's happening in this session hey there thank you chair Grail members of the council can you all hear me okay yes great well I'm normally in our office every day except for Fridays because I volunteer at my daughter's school so I'm sorry to not be there in person but uh not sorry to volunteer at my daughter's school on Friday so um but do wish I could be there but did just want to come by today at um secretary cornett's uh request to talk about the legislative session give kind of a midpoint update and also share what we know around some of the citing legislation that is still in the mix right now I'm going to keep it pretty quick and high level and hope that you all have clarifying questions this is meant to just be an update and there's actually a lot that we don't know right now so I just want to be candid about that and just really open the door to questions discussion comments um to help sort of inform my work and secretary secretary Cornett and other staff members in the sighting division who are also engaged in the legislature with me so with that we can go to the next slide please thanks so I highlighted where we are um as counselor Dublin can attest uh one of the busiest times of each legislative session is right where we are now between that deadline first chambered a post-work session what that means is a work session is where bills move out of committees and so there's a deadline by which any bill that's going to be moved out of committee gets posted and then there's a Scramble for those bills to move out of committee and into either another committee or to the floor for a vote of that first chamber and what it means that a state agency is we are getting a ton of fiscal impact statement requests so we are just looking at bills seeing what kind of new work they would give to us and figuring out how we would staff that new work if we need resources for Contracting so on and so forth so it is an extremely busy time at the department of energy right now and that's because there's actually a lot of bills I say with our name in it that would give us new work so in one way it's kind of exciting that the legislature entrusts us with doing work that they find important but in another sense having to do sort of quick program design on the fly with a couple of days notice right now is feeling a little a little rough so um just kind of wanted to generally flag um that sort of big picture of where we are in the session what it's like to be at the department of energy when this is happening what it also means is that policy bills are sort of racing through um really quick turnarounds for Amendment requests or amendments so there could be a bill that looks like one thing and an amendment could come in and completely change it or we we could get all of our plans laid out to be ready for that fiscal impact statement request about what a bill would cost our agency just to have the whole bill dramatically change we're experiencing that right now with with an amendment we just saw yesterday and we're having to like I said kind of on the Fly design what a program would look like for the agency so um just kind of giving that sense of how things are going but also I think it's pretty relevant to how things are going on citing bills so with that I'll go I can take any questions on General timeline if you like but just really quickly to preview ahead the legislative session has to end by the end of June constitutionally um and then there's other deadlines coming too but really after April 4th that sort of frenzied nature of the place dies down for a little while until it just becomes the budget conversation about anything that's going to cost money and then it gets frenetic again in May and and for some people in the legislature and not not all it gets frenetic all the way through June um so I'm just kind of giving that um General context and then we can go to the next slide but if anybody has questions along the way I'd welcome folks to just feel free to interrupt me as I'm going that's fine with me so one area that our um I know that our uh counselors and our staff at citing track closely relate to nuclear energy I'm I think most of you probably know that there's some decades-old statutes on the books in Oregon that make it basically impossible to cite nuclear facilities in Oregon with some exceptions for very small facilities um I think some folks might know that there's like at read and OSU each of them have some sort of small test nuclear type projects but not big enough to to trigger that ban on nuclear energy facilities it's not really a ban outright it's like a practically practically abandoned um but anyway the um there were three bills that were all very similar or even identical that would have undone that statute that creates that practical ban and one of them House Bill 2215 the first one listed here had a public hearing this session and actually they had two public hearings there was enough testimony that it spilled over into another day so just wanted to flag that there was a lot of conversation about this issue in the house climate energy and environment committee this year three legislators introduced the bill came and testified in support of the bill and then there was an organ based company that also testified in support as well as other sort of interests related to the emerging field mostly of small modular nuclear reactors so there was also plenty of testimony and opposition related to environmental justice concerns for the most part I would say and then the other two bills that were in the Senate did not have hearings this session and these three bills all as we say in the capital died with that deadline that I",

        "text": " leaders from a variety of backgrounds and organizations who contributed key ideas to help make this resolution um climate change will continue to affect us greatly and this resolution is key to allowing and creating spaces for students to not only learn about climate change and its effects but also create spaces to generate Solutions this resolution hopes to bring forth this issue so students can adequately learn about climate change in class as well as create School communities that prioritize sustainability and climate and so the educational opportunities related to climate Justice can be offered to all we are doing a first reading this evening and so I won't read the entire resolution out loud but we do hope that this will um pass at the next meeting or the um June meeting is when we would bring it up for a vote and we hope that by passing this resolution we can be a catalyst for other Oregon districts to follow suit and hopefully districts Across the so every student deserves the right to know what's happening to their home as well as the right to have the space to generate Solutions um so because this is a first reading um we are still open to input ideas um I know director Chandra Geary provided some feedback and ideas in email today I'm hoping our student advisors might get some feedback from some of the student groups that exist in our schools in case we've not Incorporated all of that I know some of them have been consulted already and that we can work anything in so that we can bring this up for a vote in June so with that I'll open it up for discussion director hayan sorry about that thank you yeah I have a few comments to make and I'm hoping that we can have some good logical uh discussions about ghosts but I'm going to read to what I wrote earlier today you know I love this world that we live in and I do whatever I can to be responsible about resources including recycling reusing and repurposing unfortunately we are being pushed in a direction in the name of environmental environment and environmental justice that we are not really ready to maintain California telling people not to charge their electric cars should be a big red flag to the rest of us that we are currently just not ready we don't have the infrastructure the infrastructure must be in place before mandating changes that cannot be wind turbines I see those every time I make a trip to and what happens to those giant wind turbines once their lifespan is over they go into a landfill what type of resources are required to make them how many birds are killed by them each year and what and how is that kind to the environment a two megawatt wind turbine weighs 1 688 tons uses 1300 tons of concrete 295 tons of steel 45 tons of iron 24 tons of fiberglass 4 tons of copper four tons of neodym and 0.065 tons of dyspromium and more many of these things need to be mined and these wind turbines are not recyclable again they will end up in a landfill solar panels which I have on my house and that's how we're going to have electricity in in Idaho I love solar panels but yet what is the energy cost to produce see what chemicals are involved and what risk does this pose to the people who make them my understanding is that these will need to join the wind turbines in the landfill when their life is over and finally lithium batteries they're wonderful lithium batteries they're the things that allow us to charge our cell phones over and over again without them overheating and they are what allows us to have electric cars and electric school buses the important part of these rechargeable batteries is called Cobalts and it takes 1 000 times more Cobalt for an electric car battery than for your cell phone how much more for a school bus I don't I don't know most of the Cobalt comes from the Congo where women and children mine this material for about a dollar a day uranium think radiation because radiation is uranium is often found in the mines with Cobalt many of these workers have no protective gear they are touching these materials with their bare hands I'm talking Children Here people they work in horrendous conditions it's called artisanal tartisanal mining sounds nice but I promise you it is dangerous and horrible these conditions have been equated to those of mining for blood diamonds how is this Justice certainly we must move forward with protecting our that means all countries not just some but we need to look at this logically and realistically let's not put the cart before the horse and for those of you who do not understand that figure of speech that means there's a there's a proper order of things and let's hopefully make sure that we do that and come up with some solutions that actually make sense thank you thank you director hayan student advisor Brennan so I want to First iterate that I agree with some of what Marty said or director hyen said about how certain effects of uh clean like what we describe as clean energy isn't always clean and isn't always effective however I do think that it's the building up to being able to get it completely clean and we have to take small steps in order to achieve but I also think that it's a lesser of two evils because whereas we could either start doing the progress to slowly make changes to be able to provide a better environment for students to learn in and a more sustainable environment for students to learn in or we can stay in the past and we can make it so it's not a sustainable environment for students to live in thank you student advisor McDonald yeah I'd like to refocus the conversation on the climate resolution at hand and schools and just kind of highlight the work of the students and the student group who got this resolution to the board and I think they brought this here because they understand and students and teachers understand the the space that climate change takes up in the minds of Our Generation um and so as a system that serves 42 000 students would be irresponsible to not recognize um this climate problem and the shifts that everybody needs to make to help solve it and I reviewed the resolution and it seems pretty simple and that it instructs a committee of students to assist the school district in thinking about how we can make our school system more sustainable and so I mean that seems pretty plain and simple to me and I know before this resolution and in years past there have been students group who have already been doing this work and have been having great success and I see it all the time because this is something that just students feel deeply and students understand and so I just see this as a formalization of collaboration between students and the district and an acknowledgment of the district two students which I think will go a long thank you very much director Avila and thank you um couldn't agree more with our two student advisors as well and earlier we how this resolution is is they don't see that connection of educating our students and what make an impact and taking action for our students and um I think to to Isaac's um points to reiterate or or to kind of in almost explaining why the need to focus the work which is going back to the exact language here that we would direct the superintendent to establish a climate crisis Community develop recommendations for taking action on climate change that are within the purview of the district I think that's just key the purview of the district and you know and then bringing that action where students can learn about all the facts or statements that director hayen made they can learn about that so providing this type of action and creating actionable items for our students to actually Elevate the ongoing is is going to be um I think very effective and efficient way for students to continue to learn just the education opportunities that they need to be considered of the changes taking care of the Next Generation action now being proactive instead of reactive when we have the opportunity the type of careers inspiration it can bring forth with opportunities of exposure right having them become advocates build Independence renewable energies as and and others as director hyen had mentioned Recycling and repurposing so I really appreciate the the students who brought this forward and in the bringing it forth as well and incorporating to meet the needs of our Salem Kaiser community thank you director Chandra Gary but thank you chair and I sent you a little summary and you may kindly share it with rest of the board you know this is an important topic you know we had a student from South Salem his name is mihar Joshi he's a he came to our generally stem mentoring program and gave a presentation on how he used data science in developing a predictive model for early identification of algae growth in Detroit Lake he could almost predict it by two days when the growth is there you know as Salem we faced some water shortage because of that that is an example of how we can think of using this topic so kobit 19 also exposed the shortcoming of global addressing climate Justice requires us to think globally but act locally and that's where our students can play a huge role simply blaming does not solve problems action solve problem the way I see climate Justice can occur only when we provide

        "text": " study from house bill 2021 that's being carried out by our agency right now on what's called small-scale renewable energy projects and community-based projects and so these are smaller projects more like the purple realm for those of you that i'm no purple better than i do i get freaked out every time i say it out loud but um more those those types of so we're doing a study to see like what are the barriers in oregon for those projects and i think the end result that a lot of people want to see is like how can we address some of those barriers in future legislation in order to encourage some of that smaller scale or just period organ developed energy versus developed elsewhere so that's an ongoing conversation and if they decide to look at land use that's definitely part of the study is considering that question if the recommendations include changes i could see something coming forward that touches on what you're talking about i do not expect to see that same concept move forward it was deeply controversial with a lot of people who were really concerned about some of those provisions and felt like they went too far so i would expect potentially something more measured that gets at that same at that same sort of issue around that conflict between our land use laws and renewable energy development so hopefully that's a fair that's a fair answer i mean i think it's a correct answer and hopefully it gets at the question um but there are some unknowns there and a quick follow-up you mentioned so under i wasn't aware of that 2021 kind of having this study be conducted uh do you know when you say smaller facilities are the facilities that they're looking at as part of that study would they rise to the level of f-sec jurisdiction are they looking more at smaller facilities that would have be fall under county jurisdiction i think it's i think it's the latter but i think that it's possible they could be some of the smallest types of projects you'd see might come into their conversation yeah but it's designed to be about smaller projects the qualifying facilities under purple being one of them and i i assume that sometimes some i could be wrong though i feel like i'm going out on my like fear of math realm um but i assume that some qfs fall under your jurisdiction and some don't nope never okay great then no not under abstract thank you great questions thank you any other questions for christy well i just want to say thank you because um i cannot i've tried to limit my own exposure to um quote the building during this virtual thing so i appreciate your efforts and keeping us abreast on what's going on i cannot imagine how chaotic it will be with all the leadership changes and seemingly every longtime uh leader now deciding that they want to be governor so good luck with that we'll look forward to hearing back uh after session and i presume if something hot and heavy comes up then you'll relay it to todd if you don't jump back into yourself so thank you thank you so much for having me chair grail and members of the council have a great rest of your day all right well moving on to our next agenda item we are up to public comment which is agenda item d this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment which includes the born to hemingway transmission line proposed order and the obsidian solar center proposed order both of which are in contested case at this time i'm going to flip over to wally and let him direct whether we have anyone wishing to make hey so if anyone would like to make a comment please use the raise your hand feature in webex if it's a phone-in caller you can press star 3 on your and that should raise your hand and we will try to take people in order thank you so wally they're very very dark so they're hard to see but i can see uh irene gilbert and jim kreider have their hands raised i didn't see what order they came in um i just found those two thank you todd so i'm going to start with jim crider he's at the top of my list mr kreider your phone is unmuted your line is unmuted okay so i guess i'll check can you all hear me yes thank you well thank you for taking my comment um i've talked to todd and patrick about the issue i'm about to raise but it's involving the boardman to hemingway transmission line and idaho power using a pre-condemnation procedure that is outside of the this is chair grail i'm gonna ask todd and patrick you're starting off by saying you want to talk about something that's outside of our process so my understanding is we can't talk about hortman hemingway so todd or patrick will you please step in but but it is your application process that is not being followed by the idaho power company but i'll i'll let you guys talk it through yeah so so uh mr crowder had um basically sent me an email asking about whether or not this could be brought up to council um and when we looked into it you know the there are sort of two two parts you know we have to be careful that it's not something that's part of the contested case which then would be precluded from being discussed and then the second kind of question is you know the public comment time frame is reserved for issues that are within the council's jurisdiction that are not on the agenda and so you know the you know admittedly this is sort of a nuanced sort of question about part of it you know being within council's jurisdiction but the eminent domain or condemnation or pre-condemnation is outside of council's jurisdiction and so so i had indicated to mr creditor that um that based upon the rule in the uh related to public comments that would not be within council's jurisdiction the condemnation part of the conversation but if he wanted to request that to be added to a future agenda um he could and we would evaluate that and and ultimately that would be uh the chairs discretion uh regarding adding that um so if this is related to the condemnation i think it's outside of council's jurisdiction but i would also look to patrick to to respond to that as well the concern is that this is a project that's in the ongoing contested case uh anything related to the project uh is is not appropriate at this time uh for public comment and my understanding is the issue as todd just touched upon and my understanding for mr kreider said he has concerns about uh condemnation issues which is outside of that sect jurisdiction so that is not something that that regardless of whether or not we were in a contested case council would hear the concern about the fact that this project is in the contested cases that were counseled to allow a public comment on this without at the same time other participants in the contested case to respond to any such comments that could be seen as an ex-parte communication with council as the development decision maker in the contested case so i think the safest way to proceed is for mr kreider to request that council make this an agenda item at a future meeting if council wants to take it up then council should also give other participants in the contested case the opportunity to speak to the comments that mr kreider may have thank you for that clarification uh for my purposes and mr kreider do you uh understand what they are asking to ensure that we stay in compliance with our rules um i i do not because in section 3d survey data based on final design and site access in your application you outline the process that the utility is to follow and they are not following i'm sorry sir we're not questioning the substance of what you're saying the issue is that present this to council at this point in time when we have a project that is pending before the conflict contested case it is not appropriate to have you present comments on your own without also affording the opportunity to other participants in the contested case to address those comments that is the concern so the appropriate thing to do is for you to request that this be placed on the agenda at a future meeting and to afford other participants in the contested case to also address those comments if they care to we have written to our legislators asking them to intervene or assist us and i'll be happy to share that letter with you if you are interested so that you know what we're are what we're saying to our elected thank you we're always happy to receive as long as we are following our criteria that meets the fact that we're a contested case so do you wish to ask that we add this to a future agenda item most definitely i would very much appreciate that okay todd is there anything that we need to do other than him making that request in the way he just did to allow for that probably helpful to have it in in writing an email would be fine and then just articulating what his what mr kreider's interest is in the agenda item so then as patrick said you know we can reach out to other parties as well to be specific so i would want to make sure that i'm not misinterpreting you know what the intent is so that if we have something in writing we can utilize that thank you todd mr kreider is that okay do you um are you able to do that in a way that mr cornett has yes i would be very happy to do that and todd and patrick and i have been in a dialogue for the last couple of weeks on this issue so i'm very happy to refresh and summarize that for you thank you sir we appreciate your time do you have any further comments i do not thank you wally if i understood you said miss gilbert was also wanting to make yes and miss gilbert your phone is now unmuted hey thank you um thank you for letting me speak i just wanted to go over some things as far as i've recently been reviewing the minutes from council meetings over the past two or three years and one thing that i've noticed is that there are areas where council members have said made comments saying things like they see the words of the rules but they're not quite sure how they're comments like how does the council supposed to understand this you know these statutes and make a anyway um i've been attending these council meetings now for a decade and i reviewed have reviewed nearly",

it tends to to move you in a direction of denial when it may not necessarily be the right decision in the instance that you're evaluating so I I'd encourage you to not get all hung up on precedent setting those were the only comments that I had today thank you thank you very much M Gilbert no one else is in the room to give comment and let's just check one more time the phone and the web act Wendy King does have her hand raised Wendy I'm gonna unmute your mic and you will be ready to make a comment Miss King oops just unmuted Wendy okay thank you um I just wanted to share that I appreciate the careful deliberations all of my requests for a contested case I'm uh disappointed that none of them made the threshold for a contested case I um I was unaware that I had to um present all my materials um in this uh in this uh Arena uh I was reserving all my materials to present in my contested case so um I'm very disappointed that I didn't get to bring all this information forward word to give a a better and clearer understanding of my impacts and um I would love to entertain the idea of an appeal to this decision if I don't know if that's within your rules but um that's where I would leave leave this with you and um I have some really good um requests that when the certificate um seeks local or local coordination with for instance the weed person or the um the firefighters that that consultation may need to also include the land owners adjacent to the facility so that they can provide a more coordin means of communication and response that will help in um in in the general community rather than just work separately between the um the responders and the certificate holder I think that would be valuable information to share and work with and that's all I have to say thank you thank you very much Miss King any other hands up or people on the phone Nancy there are no other hands raised I will just remind everybody online if you wanted to make a comment um excuse me in your participant window on the WebEx um you will see a little hand you can overover your name over the participant list and it will raise your hand so you can click the raise your hand icon when you're finished commenting you can go ahead and click the icon again and it will lower your hand if you're commenting on the phone then you're going to press start three to make your comment to raise your hand excuse me and star three again to lower your hand after you are done commenting there are no other hands raised at this time okay um no one in the audience No Hands raised and no star 3es on the phone so I'll close um public comment and we'll move on to the next item which is the Leaning Juniper 2A request for Amendment Three Council decision on any submitted requests for contested case possible material change hearing and public notice of hearing to adopt final order Chase McBay Walker senior sighting analyst will present an overview of the facility great thank you chair how uh good morning still uh members of the council for the record my name is Chase McBay Walker senior sighting Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy and as chair how just uh introduced I will be providing you with an overview of um any submitted requests for a contested case and of the request for Amendment Three to the Leaning Juniper 2A wind power facility um leaving it up to you for Council deliberation and potential action um on the proposed order next slide please Nancy oh well we just I just went over this next slide please thank you um as I summarized in the staff report for this agenda item the council issued the site certificate the original site certificate for the Leaning Juniper 2A wind power facility on September 21st 2007 the facility was was approved and was designed to be divided into two sections leaning Juniper 2 North and leaning Juniper to South since its approval in ' 07 uh Council has authorized two site certificate amendments one in 2009 and one in 2013 the final order on request request for Amendment one authorized uh the construction and operation of up to 84 wind turbines and related or supporting facilities within a new site boundary area which was referred to as leaning Juniper 2B the previously approved facility components um and site boundary became or were referred to as leening Juniper 2A and then in the final order on request for Amendment two leaning Juniper the Leaning Juniper 2 facility was separated into two act two site certificates the Leaning Juniper 2A site certificate and the Leaning Juniper 2B site certificate as it currently is built the Leaning Juniper 2A Wind Facility is an operational wind energy facility located within the site boundary of 6,44 Acres the facility consists of 43 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 492 ft and a peak generating capacity of approximately 90.3 megaw the certificate holder for this facility is leaning Juniper wind power 2 LLC whom themselves are a wholly owned subsidiary of aeng grid Renewables LLC and the facility is located entirely in County next slide please request for Amendment Three seeks council's approval for wind turban upgrades to 36 of the 43 turbin um and those upgrades would include replacing the wind turbine rotors the Nels refurbishing the turbine generators and reinforcing the turbine foundations Additionally the installation of a of a new 34 a half kilovolt collector system and the decommissioning of two of the 43 existing turbines uh is also included approximately 396.25 osed repow Corridor and I'll get to two figures on the next couple slides but the repow corridor itself is entirely within the approved site boundary of the facility and lastly the amendment request uh seeks an amendment be made to condition 27 to lower the above ground wind turbine blade tip clearance from 30 m to 21 MERS for the for the 36 turbin to be upgraded next slide please okay so these next two slides are an actual figure of the approved site boundary and the proposed repower Corridor um and the locations of all the turbin so the approved site boundary is the black polygon and the proposed reow Corridor where all disturbance would occur uh is everything within the purple boundary and you can go to the next please and this is the Northeast portion of the facility the previous slide was the southeast okay now now next slide please I'll get to the procedural history for this request the certificate holder submitted its preliminary request for Amendment uh Amendment Three on September 22nd of last year 2023 following review of the preliminary request for Amendment the department issued a determination that additional information was needed in November of 2023 and the certificate holder provided responses to the Department's requests for additional information in December 20123 the department reviewed the certificate holders raai responses and determined that the amendment request with the responses contained sufficient information um and the certificate holder submitted a complete request for amendment in February of this year February 14th 2024 the department issued its draft proposed order on the request on 2024 and concurrently issued a public notice which established the public comment period for the draft proposed order and identified uh the date of the hearing at the public hearing the department or during the DPO comment period um the department received four comments on the DPO one public comment one from the reviewing agen a reviewing agency and a comment from the certificate holder as well as a response to comments from the certificate following receipt of the comments well Council uh reviewed the DPO last month um which included an overview of or summary of the comments received um oh yeah yeah and then following council's review of the DPO the department issued its proposed order last month as well on April 24th and concurrently provided a notice of request for a contested case the deadline for a dead the deadline to request a contested case was May 24th and no requests were received next slide please so for council's scope of review Council must determine that the preponderance of evidence on the record supports the following conclusions that the facility with the proposed change complies with the applicable laws or Council standards that protect a resource or interest that could be affected by the proposed change and that the amount of the bond or letter of credit required is adequate next slide please so this slide uh I tried to identify the standards for which uh were not modified in the proposed order but I think it's actually easier to just say what standards uh were included changes and that was the retirement and financial Assurance standard and uh the organizational expertise standard specifically there is three conditions that we we did discuss in the council's review of the DPO um but I will uh go over those changes to the conditions uh in the next slide or two next slide please okay as I mentioned we did receive four comments on the record of the draft proposed order um and at the April 19th 2024 council meeting Council reviewed the DPO and the issues raised in the comments and the council uh provided comments to the department uh in response to those comments as well as as your own um specifically regarding the consistency of the evaluation of both the organizational expertise standard and the Wildfire prevention and risk mitigation standards uh consistent consistency in that we want to move forward and be consistent with recent decisions in response to council's comments on the DPO um relating to the Wildfire prevention and risk mitigation standards the department Incorporated additional requirements and Provisions into the draft Wildfire mitigation plan itself which I believe was a attachment h of the proposed order um but no no changes were made to any conditions in that standard but there were adjustments and requirements added to the plan itself and those adjustments included requiring the certificate holder to on an annual basis at a minimum work directly with local emergency responders to compile and maintain a current list of adjacent land owners and Property Owners with contact information the final mitigation plan would identify the best notification procedures of adjacent land owners and Property Owners to provide to local and Regional Emergency Services for emergency notifications in the event of fire ignition",

of the dotted line area ensures isolation from the grid and that's to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines lines during a power outage so now that the program is nearly up and the agency started to hire staff that will run the program from here pandian krishnaswami is on the line and is our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here yes my name is james cogell i'm a policy analyst for the program um so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th uh there are four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity announcements uh more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes with additional funds online applications will open shortly we will only be accepting applications through the online application next slide please opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and benefits the scoring criteria includes topics such as project leadership involvement of environmental justice jobs and economic development direct energy cost savings families and small businesses inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses assisting with natural health and mitigation plans and geographic and project diversity the grants will be reported on a competitive basis at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories how the funding will be distributed will depend on the number and strength of applications in the different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in legislation next slide please so uh the online application is still being finalized and expected to be available uh shortly uh you will be able to access it from the community renewable energy grant program web page um the red arrow kind of indicates where it'll be when it's available next slide please if you're familiar with odo's custom service portal you'll also be able to access it here by selecting the financial incentive drop down menu and uh selecting community renewable energy grant program next time please you get the application uh you'll be able to apply for a planning and construction grant change information and withdraw an application using the drop down menu next step please after that uh if you haven't already you'll be asked to sign in uh if this is your first time accessing the customer portal you need to register and create a profile as well next slide please so once you start an application you'll be given information about the eligibility requirements for the program and asked to confirm whether or not you and the project meet these requirements next slide please and then uh it kind of just flows into the application itself you'll be asked for details about uh the applicant organization next slide please and there'll also be opportunity to provide contact details for uh an uh which will be the person odo uh which is out to contact with any communications about the application and any questions that we might have uh you'll also be asked about if you're partnering with any organizations next slide please and you'll be able to input information about project partners i'd require documents relating to the project partners in the application portal similarly if you're working with a contractor you'll be able to put their information on a subsequent page next slide please as you go through the application portal you will then be prompted to provide information about the project details of what information will be asked can be found in the opportunity before you submit you'll be able to review the document submitted and you can click back through the application to check information that has been next slide please so once you've submitted your application uh this kind of chat shows the process our process with applicants um if you have questions about the opportunity announcements please submit them by may 20th this will allow staff to respond and post answers online before they close the application on june 10th following the close of the application applications will be reviewed after which the successful projects will be offered a performance agreement while unsuccessful projects will be able to reapply in future opportunity applicants will be able to request up to 30 of the grant funding upon signing a performance agreement for the construction grants the applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek side control filed the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met any other requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement to be eligible to receive that 30 following the signing of the performance next slide please and so thanks for uh taking the time to hear about the program um we'll be happy to hear any questions you have regret regarding it and if there's any specific information you would like more detail on please let us know thanks james and one thing i wanted to do to kind of kick us off while folks formulate their questions raise their hands um put things in the chat was just about the role of utilities when they're not applicants but are working with and um i'm i think rob and james know this i'm rusty i just got back from being on vacation so uh everyone i just want to make sure everybody knows that to start with so in case i make any horrible mistakes or anything just blame florida my dad moved there and it's way too distracting there but um but um could you maybe just riff on that like what the role like there are requirements by applicants to work with utilities um could either one of you speak to that and then talk a little bit um how you could imagine utilities supporting community applications you want me to go through some of the requirements rob and then you can maybe speak to um how some of that relationship can develop yeah that sounds good um so applicants one of the requirements in uh the processes applicants will need to consult with um the utility uh that kind of is the host utility um kind of we'll need to seek information on the impacts on to the existing utility infrastructure as well as the estimated costs of interconnection so and we're going to want to get this information so we can assess the feasibility of the projects and so quite often they might be asking for a letter from the utility to kind of demonstrate they've taken that step in consulting with uh the utility and that's going to be for both planning and the construction grants and the level of detail obviously you'll differ um because they'll have different information for a construction grant might be more details you'll be able to provide a bit more uh information in the letter but for those planning grants it might be a a little broader broader brush um and then also successful applicants um may be seeking to um file a request for instant connection um early on in that process and that because that's one of the triggers to allowing them to get that 30 percent uh upfront grant funding um in the uh once they signed the performance agreement rob do you want to continue on sure yeah um and and as christie said that the reference to consulting with the electric utility is in the bill and essentially it recognizes that all of these are complicated electrical systems that are interconnecting with grid infrastructure and all of them will require interconnection agreements and so you know consultation with the utility is part of all of these projects but kind of backing up one step we also see that there is an opportunity one for utilities to develop their own projects and in some cases they might look like some of the community solar projects that we've already seen around the state and i know that there are there's at least one of those that's being considered for the program where it would be a consumer-owned utility starting a community solar project but also just a way to pass a potentially very valuable service onto your members if you're aware of any of your members that may have a that they want to develop this is a great time to do it if it has these community attributes or some you know energy resilience attributes or serves an community within your service territory this is a great time to come in and get some funding for these projects and so we're really hoping that it's seen in that light that it's an opportunity to essentially convey this benefit to your members if you're aware of projects and i think i'll leave it there unless there's any other thoughts from christie or james i think that sounds really helpful and i i think that gail malcolm who represented cous at the table when we were developing this program was really instrumental in us thinking through the role of utilities and just want to give give her a shout out charlie tracy you have your hand up do you want to go ahead and ask your first your question um you should be off or maybe you took your hand down i'm not no question well keith has his hand up can patricia can you take keith off me okay keith you should be good chrissy can you hear me okay yes we can thank you okay thank you hey um we're working with uh bonneville environmental foundation on a possible project out here in forest grove that would involve um upwards up to about 400 kw of community solar but our project would involve us um taking all the production credits and pushing them back into our low-income uh assistance program serving all of our customers that qualify for that program would that uh under the direction you have now would that qualify for as part of the this grant funding for direct energy cost savings to our families and small businesses from that language does that seem like that would rob um yeah definitely so the eligibility requirements are are pretty straightforward that there's technology eligibility and that has to essentially just be a renewable energy technology so 400 kilowatts of solar apply without question or would be eligible without question and then the the other eligibility requirement has to do with the actual applicant and so as long as the applicant was either you as the utility or some other public body that would make the applicant eligible and the way in which the benefits flow back to low-income members of the community would help it to score points",

        "text": " be able to really fund both of those at a pretty pretty um strong level so yeah that's good okay thank you thanks you bet so um yes I'm ready for us to finalize this uh and I also want to say thank you for participating uh through the various members of your team in the development of our first ever Capital Improvement plan here at Washington County having that um planning tool here in the county is finally a good sign as we are a County government a municipal government compared to State and um also there are an incredible number of Transportation projects that we have across our County so it's just hats off to you literally today versus just figuratively for the terrific work that's been happening from Lut really appreciate it no thank you and we really appreciate again the board's engagement and support as you said it's been a long process longer than any of us could ever have imagined so we appreciate you hanging with us through it all absolutely absolutely you've really scoped out uh sound financial plans into the future cost uh adjustments really we're very proud of you so moving on to the rest of the presentation yeah so Jessica alluded earlier we're working through an administrative procedures update we also want to bring that back to your board as a resolution for adoption and again those are just the rules around the program that um articulate again and that's that is the document where uh the board has uh uh articulated the role for the wccc and the wccc TAC in the MSP program so we're not envisioning any really substantive changes it's really updates to just bring it back into line probably with more current practice and um and I Jessica alluded to earlier too we'll need to write some rules around how the large project match process goes as as she alluded to we we anticipate um a process very similar to the opportunity fund where again these this is in to be a very opportunistic bucket of funding that will be available and the um I was trying to think of a good analy but the the idea of um trying to find it's it's that combination of the right funding source at the right time for the right project with the right match and a whole variety of stars have to align in order to really make one of these things happen so um we're really really I want to recognize commissioner Rogers experience in being the county rep and for so many years uh the chair of the Washington County Coordinating Committee uh you were in that role when the opportunity fund was created uh uh at least three Cycles ago excuse me uh and I think the not only has it developed a track record and staff has come to us with the history of that and the track record sometime in the last five plus years uh and so now graduating uh to these larger needs as a result of State Transportation packages as well as Federal Transportation packages and federal grants so um I'm really looking forward to to um the development of these new administrative procedures now I was just wondering on what time Horizons that update might be on yeah we anticipate we'll have these ready to go in another couple months we've been focused on just getting the the the package pieced together and uh the administrative rules of course would guide then projects that we undertake using 3F funds so that's our objective before we start any any true project expenditures with this funding we'll have those new rules in place well I would appreciate it if in addition to the 3F package if we could get get the new administrative rules um defined and adopted while commission Rogers is here as well oh absolutely starts finish excellent all right uh any questions on that then okay and then lastly uh you know I just want to say to um the there's obviously a lot of discussion around countywide funding needs and challenges and opportunities and so I just want to re reate that we've been working really closely and you said it earlier chair that we've been working very closely with Mrs Angie and uh the county administrative office and um our chief finance officer Greg mun on how to make this work and so we feel highly confident that we have a good plan going forward and we'll continue as you alluded to again through the annual Capital Improvement plan review that's really our opportunity to just make sure that you're getting a good annual update on how things are going and what uh what things look like uh as we continue to progress forward so we look forward to keeping you engaged in that process throughout and commissioner Wily's question earlier uh was an Appo one of transportation is transportation funding is a puzzle and the the puzzle shapes or form uh changes over the course of decades and and along with that I just want to express my appreciation for the flexibility that you and your staff has shown in relationship to all of the budget issues that we Face the expectations that we face all of the different pieces and I think that that's part of that larger puzzle but uh you guys have been great in uh in working through all these issues and to me that's even a little different than storms ice storms leadership Chach and all those other things yeah now this truly it's it's been a one Washington County approach so I I really uh give a lot of credit to the other folks uh in the county that are really helping us move this move this through yeah if I come back to your question commissioner um when I was a Metro counselor my very first RTP in 2007 uh Tom cluster uh was the main lead of that RTP in that cycle and uh he paid a huge to Washington County uh particularly with the misp program and building out the super grid that we basically take for granted now here in Washington County but as a result of this program the uh across Washington County we've been successful in having Metro designate Urban growth boundary because of that discipline and determination to build the transportation infrastructure not only at the neighborhood level but at that grid level which is something when you look at uh uh clamus County you just don't see and I remember what it took at Metro tables to uh direct more mtip funding and State package funding just to get the the uh Sunnyside Road Corridor done uh and while they while Clackamus County has used every other tool except for a voter approved uh property tax you know Urban R renewal districts uh local Improvement districts you name it um the misstep program that was created uh under the leadership of Roy Rogers and prior commissions uh we are really blessed here in Washington County to have it yeah well with that uh I think we're I think we're done any additional information other questions that we can help answer and okay nope don't think so terrific great job you all thank you yes we're very proud of you thank you okay we're going to go to a different part of the Lut Department over to planning and uh we are looking towards the end of the light at the tunnel on significant natural resources yes don't worry yes Teresa's been working this program uh for a good say at least seven if not eight years I was a Metro counselor and that was the first time I met her was the creation of can't excuse me Michelle it was Michelle I saw at a cp7 meeting so yes it's been a long time uh but you've created a lot that we haven't had before so we're getting this one done too we are well thank you chair Harrington and members of the board my name is Aon Wardell I'm the planning and development services manager and with me are Michelle Miller Senior planner and Teresa chernak principal planner we are here to give you an update on our significant natural resources regulatory update well good afternoon chair Harrington and Board of Commissioners I'm Michelle Miller Senior planner with land use and transportation um today I'm here to give you an update on the significant natural resources work that we've been doing and to go over where we're headed in our update to the regulations for the urban unincorporated areas of the county I also want to talk a little bit about the community engagement that have that has helped really inform this project and talk about our next steps the purpose of today's discussion is to share the draft code Concepts uh for the significant natural resource regulations for the urban unincorporated areas of the county and to brief the board on the public engagement and Outreach that we've been busy with today's discussion questions are about the general direction we're headed for the draft code Concepts and our approach for regulating development in the Urban unincorporated area and whether there are any questions that you might have about this work so for some context on the planning and legal framework for why the county is taking on the task of updating our natural resource regulations and um and our inventory for the urban unincorporated area I want to talk a little bit about Statewide planning goal it requires local governments to identify and protect natural significant natural resource areas it also addresses things like Scenic and historic areas but we're going to be focusing on the natural resource regulations today so the county adopted uh policies and regulations for the unincorporated areas both urban and rural in the late in the early 1980s and those were acknowledged by the state our state law changed in 2017 and expanded the requirements for land use regulations that they needed to be clear and objective um when applying to housing and the County's rules concerning natural resour resources were not clear and objective as a result our natural resource regulations for unincorporated areas have been under scrutiny so a few years back uh community members requested um and argued that because our uh rules for development concerning natural resources were not clear and objective um they were out of compliance with Goal five so um the county could not enforce those protective measures on development projects in the urban unincorporated area so as a result we adopted some regulations in 2020 for the urban and rural areas uh of unincorporated Washington County to address this but they were appealed to Luba oops sorry as we began our work on making the rules clear and objective um they were also found to be out of compliance with Goal five by the land use conservation and development um commission and they put a uh in place an enforcement order on us uh directing the county to amend its regulations So currently there's a stay on certain development that may impact wildlife habitat which is a type of uh County Resources so here's our project schedule broken down by the various tasks within the goal five um planning process the bulk of the time has been spent on",

        "text": " would see on the side of the road there will be many of these kind of stacked up next to each other and the reason we have elected to pursue the the battery proposal is many folks have no renewable energy the wind doesn't always blow the solar is not always shining sun's not always shining this will allow us to deploy energy you know in the evenings or in the night time when it when it may be next slide please just a quick overview of some of the other components of a facility this i like this picture it's a wind farm in illinois that we recently i mentioned the two blue dots earlier the project substations on the bottom portion of this slide of the picture you'll see that's a single substation all of our electricity is is consolidated via underground wires which will all go into a big substation that looks like what you see here and then the voltage of of our electricity is stepped up to a higher voltage and will leave the site on an power line and you can kind of see that overhead power line leaving that substation on the right hand side of the picture it will be a similar concept on this site in the background is our operations and maintenance building which is where we'll have offices we'll have um you know maintenance shed and that's where all of our technicians will be based i think we've got a number of acreages listed on this on this slide that's kind of our expected worst case impact i think it's important to note that if you look at the the disturbed area within the square around our o m building in our substation that's actually a 10 acre parcel for all of those components we will undoubtedly take up more room for this project it's a bigger project but um you know it is a fairly compact footprint in terms of where are where where our local headquarters will you can see some of the turbines in the background with the permanent roads in in white as well as the temporary impacts around each turbine but this just lists a number of um a number of stats that will be associated in terms of access roads and um we'll also have some some new meteorological towers on site right now we actually have five temporary towers that you'll be able to see if you were to drive around the area those will come down after construction and we will put up three permanent towers to measure the wind if the project is built uh we'll also have a temporary construction yard that will be upwards of 27 acres that's where when our components are brought to site they will be staged there and then be delivered to the to the pads where they're installed next slide please on the transmission line i mentioned earlier you know there's the the uec option which was the red line heading west the bpa option which was the blue line heading north this gives a little bit of detail around it we have not finalized design on what it will look like the project is currently being studied by um by bonneville power administration to connect to the stanfield substation we expect to have results back from them in july of this year connection will require a five mile overhead line it will follow the existing bpa line that there's actually a bpa line that goes through the site right now that was one of the reasons why the site was chosen and so um we would we will need to build a new line next to that bpa line to get to a new newly constructed stanfield substation so that is the lower impact option the five mile option um bpa transmission line the the uec or umatilla electric co-op line is a much larger line it's a 25 mile line you could um skip to the next slide this provides a good uh this is a very busy slide so apologies for all of the uh all the colors but the uec line is the line that you see it's a bit of a squiggly line headed uh north and west we did not choose that squiggly line it's not obviously not the straightest line but it i think that the the key item to flag on this is that we will be following the existing uec lines that that are already there and so in discussions with uec we would take their existing lines and put new power poles on that same side of the street that they're already on they'll be taller poles power lines will go on top of the poles the existing uec lines will go we call it underbuilt on those lines uh we've done this on projects in illinois and while design is not finalized because of that that the wires have to be taller i'm sorry the poles have to be taller when we study uh this corridor you'll notice it's a pretty wide corridor ubc's right away is typically about 100 feet uh we've studied about 300 feet so if you go through the maps on the project you'll see that you know we've looked at both sides of the road and the reason for that is when these taller poles get they're laid down on their side we actually have to study you know the temporary impacts of a of working on both sides of the corridor but the intent for uec is to construct the line within their existing right away where the polls already are next slide please in terms of the the local economic impact so this is uh all assuming that the entire project gets built so if a smaller project ultimately gets built these these dollar values would come down but we do expect to pay upwards of 100 million dollars to umatilla county that would be done through the strategic investment program agreement which the county already has a number of agreements with existing wind farms it would be a similar structure to that that we will be working with the county so it's a pretty large taxpayer within the region i think that the biggest economic stimulus you'll see down the the fifth bullet it's you know we are estimating this will be about an 800 million dollar project if inflation continues the way that it has it will likely be higher than that but it's it's a pretty sizable investment um it also has a pretty large construction workforce you'll note here 400 workers on site at its peak with 450 000 person hours for once the project's up and running you know it's less of an economic impact in terms of permanent employment it has anywhere from 8 to 12 employees typically we have one wind technician for every 10 so all 112 turbines get built we would have 11 technicians plus some oversight staff so but it's in the in 8 to 12 um in terms of the permanent employees i think you know the last bullet on here is is you know part of that um you know capital power i should have mentioned this earlier like we do own and operate our projects we're publicly traded company you know we when we build a project our full intent is to own and operate it we invest in our communities and last year alone we invested almost 1.9 million dollars a picture here of a local fire department in texas where you know donations like that are very important to us and you know the folks that are directly impacted by a project in their community we like to give back where we can next slide please so this slide you know there's a quick summary of some of the engagement that done over the years you know as part of that noi that came out in 2017 we've we've engaged with a number of different agencies across the state state serving a variety of different purposes i think this is you know just this is not an exhaustive list but i think the key item here is as we've talked to these folks there's been additional studies and that we've had to do throughout the site and so if you could skip to the next slide this is a list of all the different analyses that have been done again not an exhaustive list but we've got folks on the line here that can attest that this project has been well vetted in terms of you know environmental impacts and and cultural impacts we've done lots and lots of surveys whether it's habitat surveys avian surveys wildlife surveys we've looked for a lot of washington ground squirrel habitat it's a very dry area but we've been able to avoid wetlands and waters visual noise analysis anytime you have a wind farm that's a very important analysis to be done uh we will meet all the standards required for that and then obviously the the avian surveys and eagle use surveys if we go back to earth if you recall from that prior slide at the very beginning where there's a southern portion of the site in the northern portion of the site there is uh alkali canyon goes right through the middle of the site and we've established a setback to ensure kind of minimal impacts to those those folks let's get to the next slide this is a kind of high level overview of of you know the results of all these studies is that we've redid that redesigned the site to minimize these impacts so we've avoided wetlands and waters we've avoided impacts to washington ground squirrel colonies we i mentioned that step back to the alkali canyon which was requested by odfw avoided or minimized sagebrush habitat impacts as well as that collision risk setback of our turbines from um kind of the hunting grounds in the canyon i think the last bullet on here relates to the habitat mitigation plan that has been approved by odfw the details of that will be finalized once the design is finalized so once we choose kind of uh what size turbine we will ultimately use and whether we'll build those 112 turbines or something less than that ultimately a mitigation plan will be will be implemented to address any impacts that our project has next slide please so additional impact assessments that were done relates to cultural resources not only identified sites that are outlined within our application but indirect impacts such as visual or there there's some sensitive sites and cultural sites around the product that we've worked with shippo to um to minimize decommissioning um there will be a decommissioning bond or letter of credit that will be posted to account for the cleanup of the project when the useful life is over we generally plan for 30 years on the on the wind farm upwards of 35 or 40 on the on the solar facility but a bond will be posted to when the site is reached the end of its useful life we will uh there will be funds available to clean it up and finally on the on the sounds you know we will comply with the oregon noise route noise rule uh regardless of the",

make of that disclosure will remind you and we'll include a transcript of this proceeding in the record thank you good afternoon my name is javana kasas and I'm here to share the story of my father Adan kasas a small business owner in Salem who has been part of this community since 1987 when he moved when he moved from Mexico City after many challenges and with very little money he decided to start his small business he took a leap of faith and found a small place to open his business where he rented it for 20 years 2 years ago my father decided it was time to invest in a commercial property and found the place located in Silverton Road our realtor had communicated this property could be used as a mechanic shop and we trusted her word when we first saw the property there were homeless individuals living just outside the main entrance windows were broken and new paint was needed this didn't matter to us because we knew this was our Dream to finally buy something of our own however just 8 months after we bought this property we were notified by the city that this property could not operate as a mechanic shop without a 7,000 conditional use permit this came as as a complete surprise since a realtor had never mentioned any of this running a business is not easy but my dad had never come across something like this would we have to move would we have to sell the property What Would We Tell the bank this caused stress for our family and father since my dad had just invested all his life savings onto this commercial property I went to the City Hall to look for answers and didn't understand the magnitude of this until I was told if this is not if this is not approved your dad will not will have to move somewhere else how can I tell this to my father he already had enough going on at work for me to tell him this I already knew what he was going to say this was too good to be true Joanna I knew then that we couldn't do this alone and that we needed the help of an expert and thankfully we found Britney who has been helping us and getting the permit we need however we recently learned that the city is proposing 12 conditions of approval and if these conditions are impos they will have lasting and severe consequences on the operation of my f family's business that has existed over 22 years I'm asking to please help uh my dad's business to continue operating in location throughout the years my dad has provided job opportunities pay taxes and help the community of Salem these conditions of approval have serious consequences on my dad's business throughout the years he has provided job opportunities and and has done a wonderful job in helping his customers we appreciate your time thank you for listening thank you next up is Aiden kases Angeles um good afternoon members I'm from the town of Salem my name is adanas aneles he and I'm the the owner of a mechanic uh adan's Automotive in Salem I I immigrated to Salem in uh 1987 and I've been part of this community um with me and my five kids and my wife we moved to the United States to to um make our dreams come true with a lot of effort and dedication me and my family uh try to get ahead in life and going with with the with the support of the community Road uh go in 2022 I decided to open my own business uh a mechanic shop where I was um renting locally it wasn't an easy task but with a lot of determination we we started our small business uh two years ago me and my family decided that it was time to buy our own property uh our own mechanic shop and thanks to God we found a place a local place in Road as a uh our real our realator uh communicated to us that this place was an appropriate place for our business and we trusted his word but in in 20 September 2003 the City of Salem notified us that we need to apply permission uh of a different kind to to continue operations in this uh mechanic this news causes all of stress because our agent never mentioned anything about this it was almost like if they took our Dream my dream away uh these last couple months there's been a lot of unknowns and my business uh it depends on this permiss on this uh permit to to keep uh to stay in operation uh we've been um with in this process with the help of Britney who has uh told us that we need a uh who's been telling us what we need but recently we we found out from the City of Salem that we there's more conditions than we need for for I'm I'm here today to ask for support and let you and let everybody know uh that these conditions have had direct impact on my on my business my goal for today is to keep on working like a as a mechanic and uh support my community today I'm asking that please uh help help support to reconsider some of these conditions to continue serving my community silam is my home it's where my family is at and we have this opportunity to grow please continue supporting me and my small business uh thank you uh adanas kasas Angeles thank you Britany Randall okay thank you good evening mayor and Council my name is Britney Randall and I'm the owner of brand land use located in W 2 I'm representing my clients um adon's automotives great job you guys I have conditions of approval and comments here um prepared for each of you if that is helpful to bring some context to this issue so previously the property which is located at 3393 Silverton Road in s was utilized as a commercial Bakery dating back to the 1980s after the bakery ceased operations the site and building were listed for sale and sat vacant during its vacancy the site became an attraction for nefarious activities the windows were broken the building was vandalized with graffiti illegal camping took place there was trespass and drug activity uh persisted and plagued the site giovana and her family made an offer to purchase the property in 2022 prior prior to the adoption and implementation of our Salem comprehensive plan amendments and zone changes at the time the offer to purchase the property was made the site was designated as General commercial and the motor vehicle use or excuse me motor vehicle service use was an outright permitted use on the site the family closed on the property in January of 2023 after the implementation of the r Salem changes giovan's family was not the property owner during the implementation and therefore we're not sent notice of the changes taking place and we're not uh suggesting that the city aired in any way in the notice um they believed they were buying a property in the CG Zone which would permit her dad's business to operate there after closing giovan's family excitedly secured their new building and began repairs and cleanup the exterior of the building was cleaned and painted and giovan's Dad began providing his Services repairing vehicles in this city it was not until the business sign was painted on the side of the building that giovan's family was made aware of the fact that they were actually operating in violation of the zoning code at the time it was believed they only needed to permit their sign to become compliant but after submitting their sign permit the planning department had informed them that their Automotive use requires a conditional use permit in the mixed use 3 Zone which is the property's new designation this is what brought giovana and I together our team was hired to assist her with obtaining the conditional use permit using examples of other permitted conditional use permits we imagine the city would impose some conditions of approval like the installation of wheel stops to better protect pedestrians along the sidewalk but what we were given was a list of conditions which will render the site unusable by giovan's family for their business with only three minutes to bring your attention to this matter I don't have time to comb through each of these conditions and our responses but we've prepared a handout for each of you to review and can answer any questions that you have thank you I'm going to defer to the City attorney counselors as I your microphone's not on councelors as I mentioned this would be an next party communication from the applicant and the applicants representative to council and I would recommend not getting into a discussion within this matter is at the preap stage at this point they haven't completed their application it'll eventually go to the hearings officer if they complete their application at that point point it could go from the hearings officer to council so it would be inappropriate for Council to take an active role in this application at this point because it's the hearings officer who will make the decision councelor Phillips I have a process question thank you mayor uh this is I think for City attorney Dan ainson um in regards to the documents mentioned would they be captured in the typical work that's coming in future I'm I'm not sure what documents you're referring to the the documents she has with her like outside of this being land use which is unique and it's exp parte how would that normally is that going to be captured and communicated to whoever is making this decision process if she submits them then they will be yes okay thank you for that thank you all right now we're going to go back to item two as a reminder folks we have no we're folks we're not going to be clapping all night we have a lot of folks to get through so we need to keep our uh our audience participation to a minimum I'm going to call you up in twos remember we have two different uh

bicyclists like myself but Walkers families dis the disabled everybody and that's kind of going to be my mission for the next while is not to forget about our other wonderful Parks but to focus on on the canyon to bring it back and make it not only a great recreational area but an area of Economic Development because Maran county is pretty and we want to keep it that way and uh we just want want things to be like in the 30s when the the CCC came in where they built beautiful things that really benefited people 50 years from now that's what my vision and the commission's vision is now first

look forward to be having him on commission with us so again I'll let Brad talk a little bit about what he does go Ducks go duck I am a little neutral here I will sayerland the Beavers are over there

and uh obviously the resourcers uh project is a big commitment tell us a little bit about well my my story is a little different from herses I'm am a native Oregonian I grew up in Eugene and spent my adult life and career in global Health mostly in uh Africa so about a year and a half ago I decided that Journey was ending I retired and moved back to my native Oregon where am I going to live the best part I came to Salem and then started looking around for something to do you know when you spend your entire life engaged in Saving mommies and babies and then all of a sudden you don't save mommies and babies anymore a 24hour day can be pretty long so I began looking at different different opportunities and came across this thing called marry and resources and since environment was one of the things that I wanted to get involved with uh it seemed to be a perfect uh match for me and during the training I heard about this thing called the solid waste management advisory Council I thought H",

        "text": " advisory committee meetings um we'll have property owner engagement and then tabling events that I talked about a little bit throughout the throughout the summer next slide and here's some more of the different events the community forums we I think we'll be needing two Community forums or listening sessions and those will kind of follow the online open house survey for those that are just more generally interested but want to give feedback and uh those will be in October and February that'll be right before um we're proposed before we file uh the ordinance with the proposed changes and then I have the Planning Commission work sessions lined up here as well and at the different topics that we'll be talking about at the various project milestones next slide so a little bit more about um Planning Commission involvement and any other I'd love to hear your thoughts on the engagement strategies or if you have any questions about the process moving forward I know it can get quite Technical and some of some of you are new to the new to our new to this topic um and process so be happy to try to answer your questions or do you have any I have I have a couple questions um but I'll I'll defer to commissioner um vedu if you'd like to go first thanks chair Lockwood yeah I was just wondering if you could um talk a little bit about uh if there is a Dei framework that we're working under um to engage historically underrepresented communities and um you know ensuring that we're hearing the voices of all of um the residents of Washington County great great question one of the the work that was done through the misstep project and the middle housing work that was done they developed that I'm a rapport kind of took assessed our demographics and our Equity strategies and we incorporated that into our public engagement plan and took a look at where we might be looking to have different groups for um different types of Engagement that might be needed and one of the where we have we have from that work we have a list of community-based organizations that will be reaching out to at the start of the project to see um if they would like to to meet with us and talk more about the project and get their thoughts on it and then we thought we would put on the website as well a place for interested groups to let us know that that they would like to have more information about the project um and then they'll also be at the various tabling events we plan on having um uh Spanish interpretation as needed um the website will also be in Spanish as well and we'll be um doing Spanish interpretation of some of the materials and some of the materials will be translated upon requests and starting with the draft public engagement plan we are working with the office of equity and inclusion we're going to be meeting with them in a couple of weeks to get their feedback on our plan to see if we can add any components or if we miss something in in this draft to focus on as as we move so we're really trying to consider all of those all those very aspects throughout the project an important important piece of this work commissioner poder thank you thank you for the presentation um having been working with the county and um having been part of seeing what the Dei strategy has been in regards to community outreach for the past couple of years including for transportation for land use planning and all of it um honestly their County doesn't seem to have a plan um on hand so none of the Departments actually have a strategy because when that question is asked that what is the Dei strategy um I think we keep going round and round in circles that we will we will but we don't have a plan that this is what these are the steps on between now and then we are going to uh the Dei office has been uh is part of this community is part of it we do not have a community-based Dei board that is actually engaging with all of these departments and we do not have any information on what uh the uh I think acre does somebody know if it is called the DI community board yes it is called acre yes so um um the ankle is not what acre has suggested for the planning um department for the Planning Commission we do we do not have any information about it and frankly when I had attended the transportation um planning for Transit um I think 108 180 people out of 700 000 people had filled in a form 180 if I'm not over exaggerating I think it was 108 which was quite outrageous considering that we have that many people in our County we seem to be able to get voter pamphlets to every household but we can't seem to get information out to people so since um we talk about a strategy but we don't have a strategy I would really appreciate a concrete strategy that uh to be brought to the Planning Commission so that we can see where um where the missing chunks are and help fill that in that these this is what is actually being done and this is the exact game plan these are the dates these are the places uh what farmers markets which ones are the are they in the farmer's market historically we've seen it's the same people who attend every single week so once it's been done in one farmer's market where else in what unincorporated area um uh Spanish is not the only language that is spoken by people of color uh based on where which unincorporated Washington County we are in uh there are people who are speaking Pacific Islander um indigenous languages other indigenous languages Asian languages so those languages are never taken into consideration so that that is part of the strategy um also um which we are going to uh which I'm going to put in a motion at the end of the meeting with planning commissions the exploit uh the county exploiting expert advice of planning Commissioners by not by not giving Planning Commission stipends so that we can be engaged and involved at a deeper level with the community and with the Planning Commission so that the time that we are dedicating to this is uh worthy of something that is part of Dei strategy that when we include planning Commissioners it is not just anybody on any given day walking in and volunteering for this commission we are supposed to read things in advance we're supposed to understand things ask people questions engage with 700 000 people which the nine of us are not doing uh or are not able to because of our lives so all of that is also part of the DI strategy so when the planning department asks us that yes absolutely planning Commissioners should be involved and engaged in this process but without a proper di strategy for the planning Commissioners and the community it almost feels like we're just still talking in the air um that's it commissioner uh will I think you had your hand up put my hand up again and looking for the mute button yeah so I just wanted to volunteer if um staff needed in addition to uh chair Lockwood additional participation and Technical advisor committee I'd be available oh that's awesome thank you sounds good um I had a couple questions um I wanted to clarify Ms Miller that um the the impetus for doing this came from the Board of Commissioners I believe and the context is that we have materials relating to where the significant natural resources are that are dated and not really that helpful and I'm trying to remember when we talked about this before we're talking about Urban unincorporated Washington county is that correct that's one aspect of it but but the ordinance 869 what included um standards that were in the urban and rural area are significant natural resources is all-encompassing our Focus for the inventory part is on the urban unincorporated area but will ultimately be making changes to the policies and regulations in both the urban and rural areas okay because we have significant natural resources in both areas um go ahead well and the impetus for the impetus for doing this the extent of this particular work is to address the remand of the ordinance 869 and so they gave some direction about what we need to do to make our um our Co our language and our development review code clear and objective we we need to follow the goal five process and the remand came from Luba a land use board of appeals right and I'm trying to remember I think it was around 500 Acres that in total that were being talked about maybe that was yeah go ahead it's quite a bit more than that I I don't have the exact number um we have in the 1980s we we developed significant natural resources for both water related resources and wildlife and over time those res inside especially inside the urban growth boundary the areas have been some of those sites that had significant natural resources were annexed to the cities or they may have developed but they still have that overlay that says their significant natural resources so that's kind of problematic when you're trying to develop regulations on some sites that maybe don't have significant natural resources anymore and so one of we we don't really know how much exactly we have that's significant that's significant habitat that's what our Consultants are working on to figure that out for us and they're using our layer our existing habitat maps and metros habitat mats maps and kind of looking kind of what's happened over over time to see what is significant so I don't have an actual number for that what you might be thinking of is when we did the significant natural resource assessment and we did a real kind of very high level there's about 300 acres of Wildlife habitat that could be considered habitat kind of based on what we what a real high level analysis that we would be developing regulations for and then there's another 200 Acres that is likely not very developable it might be water related resources but it's labeled wildlife habitat because our data was so our data sold if that makes sense yes it does okay um and I thought my attention that you said that there might be some that there would be developing rules for around allowing development on snrs and did I hear that correctly that could be one of the one of the analysis will look to allow limit or prohibit we'll get feedback on that we likely will have what we had in the past was a limited decision we we allowed development but they had to do certain things in order to develop on sites with significant natural resources but it was really not clear and objective so we'll we we foresee that we're going to kind of keep within the the lane of that type of limiting decision we allow we allow some development and if you read that specifically",

        "text": " know net acre we will see and so Sherwood would need over the point of your planning period we see that we'll need 485 acres land so like with a factor of 0.7 or something no no no go ahead so that's that available because when we look at sure West there's thank you 1291 Acres 12 191 yeah so if we we don't say 1200 that's gross Acres so that's a net number so to get gross anchors we need to add back in to compare apples to apples if we need divide by 0.8 to come up with the gross Acres because you reduced by 20 for not just for infrastructure not including wetlands for for infrastructure usually isn't it about thirty percent thirty percent I'm just putting it out there to say that means 692 of the 1291 Acres would need to be industrial land or jobs plan to accommodate the growth we as non-planners look at 1291 Acres we think gross acres and gross acres for employment land is closer to 700 Acres not 485 because if you were to say that number to the Sherwood West citizen advisory committee they're thinking ah 485 acres and try and figure out how that's going to build up Strong West at 1291 but that's you know we're talking more than 50 of the land and sure what West needs to be jobs based after because I think we need to be Apples to Apples what's in the 0.3 infrastructure of growth setbacks right aways and that doesn't I don't know if it considered Wetlands not generally mainly roads and utilities yeah okay and this is only specific to you short of us no no this is before the current Urban this is this does not include Sherwood West this is the need that of sandwiches the need that exists as defined the 485 Acres but you're going to have to subtract from that what already exists that's buildable and we're going to get to that in a minute that gets you the number that is is needed beyond the current Urban profile it's not complicated it's just there's a lot of pieces not the only Factor but when those houses come in what does it do to itself these shots yeah all right nope yeah it's good all right and then the third step here that's that we're required to see according to the states we have to look at our short-term Supply and the state kind of the state defines that short-term Supply is over the next five years or so how much um land will be needed for employment um in the next five years and uh it comes out to about 143 acres and and Sherwood and that includes our Tonkin appointment area and that also includes the Brookman area as well so that's required in five years people needed yeah I shouldn't say it's required of the 485 1043 it will be yeah it's estimated to be needed including the PHD yes so that's the talk and employment area in in Brooklyn but not sure but not Sherwood West all right so getting to our buildable lands inventory this is our supply side of things how much land do we actually have in Sherwood for these employment opportunities so we took a look at our buildable lands in the touring we went back and did some refinement and so like I said we we put all of our personals into different buckets we you know put our Parcels we look at how many Parcels are already developed that can't be developed anymore we look at Parcels that are partially developed and have some redevelopable opportunity and what that redevelopable opportunity is and and five and then when we look at you know constraints um and we take out all the constraints uh you know Wetlands floodplains deep this was the gis based model we went into our GIS system did some refinements and so we took out from our last boa to this eoa we took out an additional 41 Acres and this is where I thought this was one of my goodness I thought this was a very good discussion that that particular model or whatever it was identifying me it had since laws I remember there one person was way way off I don't remember that one you guys it's like 19 acres and it showed the original the 2021 version basically had a fair amount of alcohol land it's not yeah it was Eric's yeah yeah and it sounds like this is I think from Metro or somebody owns this thing so the original model for our buildable lands inventory came for Metro um so Metro has modeled our land use inventory for us and then you know we went back uh and we have done the best as we can to you know figure out you know what missteps they might have had um and so we really just refined it yes knowing knowing the parcels here in Sherwood knowing that our technical advisory committee their boots on the ground like they know what Parcels out there are developed or can be but we can apply some overlay space on what we know and there was a good people in there that I can view these properties very well and technology build our own model to verify I want to say that we have refined their buildable the buildable lands inventory um we've taken our model and had done that heavy refinement to it making sure that it matches what we know what's on the ground here in Sherwood yeah I'd say we did ground true things looks at Parcels at a very high level they're looking at like aerial maps and saying here's how much building coverage is on this lot here's how much bacon portion and then they look at property values as well and say is this going to reach reasonably redevelop in the next 20 years or not um but there's all sorts of flaws where if there's open space for example on the lot itself it doesn't weird things happen and so we that's what we did the ground truth parcel by parcel and said look this thing was built in 2016 and you guys think it's going to redevelop in the next 20 years it's a 50-year building there's no way um and so we flip that we just said look we're ground truth then we're flipping that one and Brokers are able to confirm the ones of any significant yeah we have as small cities we can we can do that you know City Apartments you know they're using the same models typical to do that but that's what we have a leader of being able to do that but one of our getting back to our account plan and our goals on policies and our actions uh staff you know in the call plan it definitely says go back to our bli you know every two years and take a look and to refine it so an open running model that we can yeah um so this table here table 5.2 in the report this is the employment acres by classification and plan designation so you can see here that we we show all of our planned designations we show how many tax slots are in each the total acres in each of those plan uh designations how many constrained acres and then how many unconstrained buildable Acres we have and so this is telling us that we have um 208 a constrained buildable Acres total for foreign um this I'm not gonna get into all the specifics of this table but I think this is a very interesting table and this gets back to what Bruce was saying um yeah about employer needs and site specific needs that they need so this table here if you look down at the at the tax slots I think this is really interesting um so let's just say our let's just say our uh let's go to like our light industrial plan designation so uh we have uh five tax lots that are you know under an eager um and then we have you know five tax that range between you know two and uh five acres and then what's really interesting when we get we have zero tax thoughts that range between five and ten acres and we have zero tax lots that range between 10 to 50 acres so we are really kind of lacking those larger sites that um yeah larger are larger targeted Industries you know may need graphics for that you don't have a Graphic for that is reality is the way it works with the Brokers and the city knows what we need because we get the inquiries maybe every two weeks from the state economic request for information uh we have a manufacturer a dance manufacturer in some kind of Aerospace component and they need they need 50 acres and they were able to create sites for advanced manufacturing companies um but we don't that's the 47 Acre Site that's gone we have a 60 Acre Site which is normally remaining site that we've got and that's being developed by schnitzerland properties so everything else is tidy side so when a company is already in the humanity assets for recycling everybody's a friend we don't send them on that road uh there's there's about four or five five to ninety percent so the airpoint the mother could try to figure out how to build a hundred and nine hundred eighty thousand square feet of new space event they couldn't make a pencil because it was a nine Acre Site you can't pay for all the infrastructure that you need you know you just you can't make it so they went away they went away and and so um we see that fair amount here he's designing her sites are not terribly useful you know and it could be a challenge for Brokers and developers to consolidate fight and and the site acreage that they need and have all the property owners you know play Banks how how does this information factor Metro's process when we you know request um a ugd expansion or our our place and I imagine that that municipalities are able to try to bring in large areas of land for that type of development is that pretty sure potentially do that or if there is a way of just not so just like our h a um if our h a is telling us yes our housing needs analysis sorry if that's telling us that we have you know a certain deficit of of land for uh you know a certain type of you know housing type we can ask you know Metro when we do a ugb expansion like why we need that land to be brought in for a specific housing type so we can use this inventory here for our urban urban for a urban growth boundary request um that kind of helps um you know back up kind of you know our concept planning process and the need so this becomes a factor when it",

        "text": " experience you know running decarbonization projects and trying to get get Energy Efficiency projects implemented working with asset managers which um all in all I feel it's an important uh perspective to add to the thanks uh Kathleen bad everyone Kathleen bayette um Energy Trust of Oregon and I manage um our operations and maintenance and um behavioral offerings that includes strategic energy management for commercial customers um so my focus will be on you know you know programs that we may want to design or um how we can support um building owners in this process yeah thanks Kathleen um next up Mason good afternoon everyone I'm Vin Mason with the city of Portland Bureau of planning and sustainability and a leader building decarbonization work to meet the city climate action plan goals um here because I um worked in the original policy for the city of Portland and Commercial Energy benchmarking um in 2015 and and over continue to oversee that program as well as our home energy scoring program and the development of multifam uh energy reporting uh policy as well um and in addition to that in the last several years I've worked uh on a policy proposal for building performance standards it's um broader than just energy and carbon um it also includes Health standards and resilience and temperature standards based on what we the feedback we received from communities of color uh in Portland and uh thinking about benefits to low-income residents and so um this there's a lot of stakeholder engagement that uh happened for the development of those standards in 20 uh 22 and um I think everybody who has spoken so far was part of that process so it's great to see you all again uh that process went on hold though with the passage of HB 349 and so we want to assure alignment uh with the state and have a seamless process especially from the property owner end of of of um having to comply with two sets of policies so the city of Portland process on hold until administrative rule making is done at the state level so I'm I'm happy here to um to represent for the city and in align with the state and continue working with you all great thanks man um Abby reer with with Odo ab's yes sorry I couldn't find my cursor um but I'm ABY reer with the Department of energy I'm the division assistant with the planning and Innovation division so you all got the meeting um request from me um so I'm here a lot with the just kind of the administrative support putting um through these meetings and doodle polls and things like that thanks Abby uh Rick Becker good afternoon um Rick Becker I'm with mckinstry uh we do everything from uh me engineering Energy Efficiency facility condition assessments um pretty much within um every Market segment municipalities universities schools hospitals um data centers um and I think one of the reasons that um I want to be part of this team is that um we have a plethora of experience with very similar programs in Washington Colorado whether it's Seattle benchmarking BPS um SP sptu we and I think we bring a lot of value to the team just by knowing what challenges um we've had to go through um working with both Washington and the um programs great thanks Rick uh next up is uh Rick hajes good afternoon uh Rick Hodges with Portland General Electric um very a large utility in the state providing a lot of electricity to a lot of commercial customers um I have a background in Energy Efficiency um and working on flexible load I've engaged with you know the city of Portland's benchmarking and Washington as well um and currently looking at uh building decarbonization and grid interactivity see how that all comes into play here thanks thanks next is Zach bradovich he thank you I'm Zach bradf the account executive for Joby controls um our mission is as a global leader is smart healthy and sustainable buildings and this kind of meets that I'm responsible for all the HVAC um controls and um equipment side for my customers so I just want to help be a part of the process and then help my customers understand and how to upgrade and um be thanks and I think we'll round it out with a couple Odo folks that are also on the line um Christy split hi there nice to see everybody today uh christe split I'm our government relations coordinator and also just general helper outer on all things new bill implementation I'll look forward to listening to your in-depth wonky conversations on all this stuff especially given all the great experience I'm hearing in the room thanks thanks Christie and Alan zelinka hi Alan zinka assistant director for playing Innovation uh the codes and standards uh uh section that Blake manages this spits with my division and I following on Christy's lead I'm a help her outer on almost everything thanks Alan um is there anybody that I missed going through the list hopefully I didn't miss anybody called in everybody so great um I realized I I didn't really give an instruction for myself uh I'm Blake shalai I'm the manager of our codes and standards section at at Odo um we do a lot with energy code development Energy Efficiency standards and the building performance standards program will be um will be under this section too so looking forward to working closely with everyone on this committee over the next few months so um the ne so the next thing on the the agenda is I'll just give a a quick five minute review of the building performance standards um and the what was in the bill uh the general framework and structure for BPS in Oregon um so I'll kind of get it up on my screen here make sure I can still see everybody there we go so as you all know question will the slides be available um us they are yeah so I sorry I I forgot to mention it so we have the SharePoint site that everybody should have access to I dropped before the meeting and I emailed out to the um the agenda and the draft Charter for the ruem advisory committee and then just before the meeting I posted these slides up on that SharePoint site um along with I'll pull up later in the meeting today a draft schedule and that's all up on the SharePoint site too so but please let us know if you're not able to to access it and that's the site that we plan to use for for all rack collaboration commenting review um so hopefully everybody's able to to get to it and it so as we all know in 2023 House Bill 349 um was passed it included a number of different energy and climate related uh policies one of them was building performance standards for Oregon to address energy use in commercial buildings which accounts for about 20% of Oregon's total energy use in general it's going to require many large commercial buildings to enhance their energy management practices and potentially Implement Energy Efficiency measures if they're not meeting a certain performance Target that's based on site energy use um and it's an an eui energy use intensity per square foot um and it again it's based on site weather normalized energy use and it'll be modeled after ashray standard 100 there was a new version of standard 100 that was just published about a month ago um and I also dropped a a version of that standard onto the sharpoint site too so everybody should have access to that we have a a licensing agreement with ashray where were able to use take their standard use it and modify it for orgon's use if you're familiar with the way that Washington State approached their process too they did something similar where they basically took the standard created a state specific version of it that's our plan too um so that standard's available for you review now but as we go through the process we're going to be taking the language in that standard and modifying it and that'll essentially become our state rules so uh the PPS program is administered by Odo and the language in the in the statute and now in or in ORS is very similar to what was past in Washington modeled closely after that program as far as the building thresholds go they've defined these tier one and tier 2 buildings uh tier one buildings are all commercial buildings non-resident IAL hotels and motels that are over 35,000 squ ft and depending on their size we'll determine when their compliance date hits the largest building start in 2028 then phasing down to slightly smaller in 2029 and then ultimately anything 35,000 square feet and above by 2030 there's also this definition for tier 2 buildings which includes certain sectors of buildings multif family residential hospitals schools dormitories and un buildings over 35,000 square ft um and then also General commercial hotels and motels between 20 and 35,000 square fet and the difference between the the main functional difference between a tier one and a tier 2 building is that tier one buildings will be required to meet a building performance standard to meet that energy energy Target the performance Target where tier 2 buildings will just be required to Benchmark and Report their energy usage we have a directive to evaluate potential building performance standards for these tier 2 buildings um in a few years but the the initial step is to gather data to Benchmark tier two to inform future policy so are there are there any general questions on PPS in general in the state any of these State uh specific thresholds or targets at this point happy to answer if there are any I'm not seeing any and as we go along to feel free to raise your hand if you've got some yeah go ahead then oh yeah thank you um a question for uh this Ru making committee currently is it just for tier one buildings or are we also uh working on administrative roeming for tier 2 benchmarking so we do have to um write the rules for tier two tier 2 benchmarking um by the end of the year that's all part of the same process the statute directs us to also establish a tier two rulemaking advisory committee but it doesn't ask us to do that until next year really um so we are planning to kind of develop a focused tier 2 group this year too the main function of this committee is tier one but it'll also include some of the tier two components also so if that if that kind of answers the question but we started to think about what that tier 2 building the tier 2 uh committee looks like and and we plan to issue kind of a call for um Representatives on that one too soon but yeah the main function for this one will be tier one but",

What is the purpose? of the MP program that was established to encourage the development and in the centers of city \u200b\u200bin transportation corridors It is not designed to make a program of affordability the part of Affordability is what the council wanted Add as requirement If the developments want to obtain this tax extension is a way to obtain affordable units on the market redevelopment we have done it in a way similar with our renovation areas urban single property add the affordability requirement in a development is a good way let's say usher in affordability in the development developments but there is a threshold a breaking point where the feasibility of the projects Then the project the purpose is not the affordability would be generating more units and more units in a denser environment in the cities in the centers of the cities Thank you That helps us understand the MP woman n questions comments thanks If we were to approve it tonight the staff recommendation would be basically adopt the resolution approving the tax extension under the mep and how tax exempt we are speaking in a period of 10 years of a total How much money we would be collecting in taxes I don't have that number in the fingertips but I can go back to the report and I tell you in a moment what we included in the report 700,000 personnel for the first year of tax deduction by multiplying it by 10 we are thinking 1.7 million at that point 1.8 the reason I'm asking or I mention it is because we have definitely received a written testimony online reviews of how the city can afford to give exemptions Prosecutors seeing our restrictions financial How could I answer it I know They are talking about tax exemptions. a political opinion but I'm sure It's not the first time they've done it this type of question the answer to this question is that this deduction has zero impact on the fund general of the city if not we provide this exception just not helps general fund situation because these properties are in the urban renewal area would be the area of urban renewal that would have to analyze the collection of these funds How much money do we have in approximately for the urban renewal area We raise 7 million dollars a year approximately currently not we don't have we don't we're losing money to invest in this Thanks That It is very useful another question I have is we hear many concerns testimonies of people who came tonight I know that you provided us He sent us an email talking about salary problems, I don't know if it was subcontractors level what they found They identified yes I was there for a couple of hours talking to union representatives of carpenters watching the videos that also the counselor and stapleton the counselor stapleton and the they saw we saw that it was not at the subcat level The problem was a little below this level we are talking about agents labor or labor get these employees below the line of the subcontracting Then for the information that is given to me shared the complaints is that these labor agents or agents labor are sending many employees to many workers throughout the state and also the west coast the recommendation is or apply a transparency ordinance or Add requirements for you to obtain something where contractors would have to reveal following that line of employment reveal whether they work directly with subcontractors or Who works with labor agents and identify themselves to those entities Thank you if I have another ask more sir mayor commented previously working whoever is the builder we can have a list to have more transparency about contractors subcontractors, bosses and construction workers recent work those that are about also below subcontractors we are creating a burden for the city keeping that list and asking for that project list for this I would say request it and receive it and keep it in a file would not be a excessive load but if that means going to the site conduct interviews do some type of monitoring in that case if we have to see an impact on the staff makes me curious because the construction is certainly not my area of expertise but I don't know if the cities they reach that level if they do some inspection random inspection interviews or This is in certain cities in Oregon It is carried out according to I only s in salary projects established with they have the funds generals or higher authorities So that's when we see and review the payrolls and we do interviews in the site of work and at this point feel that there are many allegations of this fraud with salaries, he believes that concerns are being resolved there current research What is the status of this the representatives from the carpenters union yes shared cases what happened to and who are since we have very few staff to carry out this investigation I don't know if the complaints are that presented against dcon projects in the city or in other projects in the city \u200b\u200bSo I don't have that level of specificity this is the right way start with these complaints and move on to the entities that already exist to monitor this type of behavior and there are several people who They testified that There are mechanisms to inform or to reveal information my expectation is that ours is a project of the entire city \u200b\u200bbut I would assume that in any moment we are working any dicon worker etc. We hope that developers continue on foot and and that they work with the workers employees and to investigate the allegations that take authority there is something what the city does so that developers know and let them see what it is acceptable What type of message are looking when it comes to the sector completely private we have no funds federals involved we do not have no notification of course I know I don't know advice on the departments in federal projects yes we have a whole flow of requirements But when it comes to incentives urban renewal or tax exemptions We don't have that kind of existing requirements because we follow the State law State law does not have it now that we know that these allegations are They're chasing us and we have no idea what are they going to do with them and how much does it take eh In case how long Take this case you are comfortable to achieve this project and go ahead with the project Yes thank you thank you and yes I have one amendment to potential motion did not see it in detail but eh it goes in these lines and When consulting with the union carpenters The idea is to try to eh put the spotlight on this problem and avoid these problems in the future where we have to have a eh minimum required of all contractors subcontractors all people who work there provide you with the city so that you are subject to files that are public and that people can review the lists and if you want to look for patterns of behaviors etc. well then this basically it would give us light on knowing What are the actors that are not behave appropriately in the city It would be a good first step and as he said mister dicken would also work for you I don't think it would prevent the project moving forward would give us the beginning of safeguards to prevent it that was the goal in creating this amendment Sorry, you're going to hear it again. I couldn't get it out time because it took me 3 hours to create it but advisor Barney Thank you very much My question is hey to the director and thank you chrisan for your patience these last few weeks and all the answers to so many questions we learned a lot about taxes property and also to Mr. Laren and the documents were very helpful and My",

already got adopted plus all the secret traces so the dashboard is supposed to be able to help us get there and it will build over time it won't be perfect when it first comes out great thank you uh chairman gone well just as a as a general comment yeah that's all good and and in business we we can move faster is is a different game and and sometimes if we push too hard too fast then uh there's repercussions too so just just have to watch out so that we actually do accomplish but we want to even if it's a little bit slower good point commissioner eatman and um and it is really important that we also take the time we need to engage um oregonians and and how we how we solve this problem so uh trying to kind of balance those two things that's a Trevor Donald commissioner Ford yeah thank you um I I just want to make a comment as well I um the comments in regards to transparency to think I think we are doing a better job at that uh business and government aren't the same it would be nice if they were closer uh in alignment but in particular I think what we need to pay attention to more moving forward is one of the thought processes which is you know or are we measuring process are we measuring and and I think we just as we as we set up the the dashboard concept let's make sure that we really do keep an eye for uh for the outcomes rather than the process and and because I think that's going to be helpful to everybody so I do appreciate the public comment on this um government and business are are different and have different roles uh but I do think that that we certainly um can work on our transparency and in particular work on uh the outcome goals that we're measuring against um and I think that'll be beneficial to everybody so thank you for the opportunity thank you commissioner Ford uh Linda has anybody else signed up to yes we do we have a k jellen Fletcher just a moment sorry I missed that name um K uh j-e-l-l-e-n-e-l yes hello am I unmuted yes you are yes you are awesome thank you so much um hello my name is Kellen Belcher and I really appreciate both the opportunity to comment and appreciate all of the commissions leadership on climate action I'm a climate policy manager with the environmental defense fund and I'm speaking today on behalf of EDF 70 000 members and activists in Oregon we must act to reduce carbon emissions and we must act quickly we have less than a decade to cut Global greenhouse gas emissions in half to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate impacts oregonians are already experiencing dangerous climate and health impacts as a result of fossil fuel use with communities of color low-income households and Rural communities bearing a disproportionate burden EDF strongly supports the commission's recommendation updating Oregon's statutory climate goals The Targets in these updated recommendations are consistent with the best available science and consistent with both the level of climate action we are seeing from Oregon's West Coast neighbors and the level of ambition of President Biden's National Climate commitment interim 2030 and 2040 targets are especially important for keeping Oregon on Pace and driving near-term reductions the impact of long-lived greenhouse gas emissions is cumulative much of the pollution we're emitting into the atmosphere today will linger and continue to cause warming for decades to come so ensuring persistent year-over-year emissions reductions in line with interim goals is critical we also also want to emphasize that Oregon's climate programs and regulations will need to be expanded accelerated and made more comprehensive in order to ensure that the state actually achieves these ambitious updated targets I'd like to also voice really strong support for the draft recommendation to position Oregon to take full advantage of federal investments in climate action these Investments really offer a golden opportunity for states to supercharge their progress on clean economic growth while lowering energy costs and also reducing harmful climate and air pollution I also want to note the strong connection between these two things between updating Oregon's climate targets and maximizing the federal funding that Oregon can receive updating Oregon's climate targets and providing certainty that they'll be achieved will provide confidence and certainty that the state's economies on a consistent pathway for reducing emissions which will in turn provide the confidence and certainty needed to help catalyze projects and Investments including in the private sector um so I'll just close by saying we're extremely appreciative of all the work that this commission has done this has been a huge undertaking and the resulting recommendations to update Oregon's statutory climate targets are thoughtful ambitious and a very important step forward for putting organ on a path to cut emissions at the pace and scale science tells us is necessary so thank you so much thank you Kellen appreciate that um we are due to take a break just before we do um I'd like to just kind of tee up what I'm hoping will happen next um which is Commissioners can identify um uh additional discussion you want to have uh on the specific recommendations um and then what I'm hoping for is that we will someone will be able to make a motion with as many of the things that we think um we all agree on based on some of the conversation today um and then if we need to come back and kind of have additional discussion on um individual um recommendations we can do that so just let me reframe how I said that um so we'll we'll ask people to flag any any topics that need additional discussion and then after that uh we'll ask for a motion to um Advance uh as many of the of the recommendations as we can and then if we don't get a a vote in favor of of something with all of them and we need to revisit uh some one of the sub recommendations we can go back and do that so um that's how I kind of want to handle the the voting uh after we all come back um and so I think we're slated uh Zach are we for a 10 minute break I think we had 15 minutes in the agenda that I know we're a little bit uh over time but I think up to you and in terms of whether you want to do 10 or 15. um let's do 10. so we'll be back here at um 11 well let's say 11 25. I got the recording going again just in case we want to start up thank you you're welcome welcome back if you could please um either maybe come up put your video on uh so that we know when folks are mostly back appreciate it it's like we might be still missing a few people if folks could put their videos on um when you're back with us you can turn it off again but just uh that'll help us track who's who's with us Miss Cheryl Kristen are you back with us in just a minute more Kristen if you can turn your video back so we know you're with us okay well um why don't we go ahead and get started and hopefully Christian will um we'll be back shortly um so as I was going through as we were going through the um meeting and discussing uh possible changes I made some notes about some things that I think we need to follow up on and just make sure that we're all thinking the same way about the and so we discussed splitting 2C into two different uh so that we could have a net zero net negative goal and we could have a sequestation goal uh to clarify that you know achieving that zero we can consider a wider range of ways of um getting to Net Zero than just natural and working lands obviously we I think we have a lot of reasons to be thinking about that first but there are other ways that we can get there so we wanted to separate those two uh to make it really clear and I think we also wanted to make it clear that the commission would be engaged in making recommendations on both those fronts so I think we had a pretty good conversation about that and um we don't have language drafted but I feel like the conversation was robust enough that we could have uh staff come back with a new recommendations and and based on the discussion that we had that that's at least my view we talked quite a bit well there are a lot of changes in a recommendation three we talked quite a bit about the substance of those changes um one thing on my mind as we were in terms of some of the um comments that we got uh from the public uh I think we might want to add some language that references the importance of including key and enabling conditions in the aips the action implementation plans so you know we could add that in to make sure that we're asking agencies to consider what some of those key enabling factors might be so that they can get a little more attention as we go into thinking about how to um how to achieve the the goals that we're trying to achieve and then um we discussed quite a bit about how to reframe 4B to make it clear why we want to update road maps uh and telling that it's it's really about um the most up-to-date information in the hands of decision makers uh as possible to inform how we do our Advance our climate work and then I think on 5c we talked about what to do with the local government representation it now appears uh in the recommendation about voting members I think I see three options for how we could handle the local governments we could leave it where it is in the voting members move it to the non-voting members or include text that talks about the importance of uh doing more Outreach and engagement with uh local governments uh to inform our work and to make sure they're informed um by ours we had conversations about the other two editions and we checked in with agencies um and some other uh collaborate collaborators uh about those proposed changes uh might be good for us to reach out to folks like the league of cities and Association of counties to talk they would like to be included in the which I think would lean towards maybe including texts that talks about text rather than putting them in one slot or the other um this app also flagged for us that putting local governments in the non-voting number might there might be some statutory challenges to that so those are the things that I think um under consideration are there other recommendations that",

        "text": ". So how are they able to do that? Because from Commissioner Bryant's point of view, if that's the case, staff should have never accepted the application. So something's confused. And I think that's what we're all here to try to solve. It's just that simple confusion. The last part first, from time to time, we have a question come up, whether staff should be the gatekeeper and tell somebody who wants to apply for something, they can't apply for it. That puts staff in an awkward position. They can tell the applicant that they would recommend against something at their very first session with them, but if the person wants to go ahead and apply, they're free to apply and leave it up to the board to make the decision. We have that come up in several different contexts periodically. So going back to, you could go back a long ways. The 8555 Growth Management act in 1985, our comp plan, we attempted to adopt one in, like, 92 or 93. It was finally adopted in 94 that had the rural land use. Clearly, the idea of the rural land designation, the RL designation, was intended to preserve rural areas. That's what it was for. And so one of the things you want to do to preserve rural areas is to prevent the encroachment of urban uses into the rural areas. And so at the same time, though, even before we actually had some of the statutes that talk about property rights and incorporating into our comp plan a specific section about private property rights, the board recognized that when we adopted the rural land use part of the entire comprehensive plan, that if we had totally imposed that on people that owned commercial zoned properties, the issue with the comprehensive plan is, is that that is the law. Okay? So, for instance, over in Citrus county, there was a case that went to the fifth District Court of Appeals, citrus county versus halls river development. They had a situation where the county changed its comprehensive plan, but for some reason, they neglected to change their zoning code to conform to the plan. And so somebody came along and asked for a zoning or a development consistent with the zoning, and the county granted it, but it was inconsistent with the comp plan. And so what happened was third parties, not the applicant, but let's say neighbors who didn't like that, came in and filed a lawsuit and said, wait a minute. What the board granted was inconsistent with the comp plan, and it's illegal. And initially, the circuit court disagreed with that challenge, but they appealed it to the district court of Appeal. And the district court of Appeal said, the comp plan is the law. You cannot approve something that's inconsistent with the comp plan. If you do, it's unenforceable. So I think the. I wasn't here in 1996. I came here in 2010. I'm trying to glean from what I know about having worked in local government law for 40 years, that in multiple counties, that, again, the rural land designation was intending to preserve the rural character of that area. And so, but still, they were wanting to at least protect the private property rights of those people, rather than just saying, okay, we're going to come in and down zone all of you people with commercial land uses to conform them to the comp plan. We're not going to come in and rezone all of you people to a one. The board didn't do that back then. It could have to make the zoning conform to the comp plan. Actually, if you look at the Florida statutes, within a year after you adopt a comp plan, you're supposed to make all your zoning conform to the comp plan. So this was what I think Mister Risen used the phrase a walk around. This was what the board came up with to not down zone all of those commercial properties to an agricultural use, but said, okay, we're going to leave your zoning in place, but we're going to say if you want to come in and actually develop, you have to develop to this new category of RC one that we've created to accommodate some level of commercial development that would be consistent with the rural land use. And so that's where that came from. And I think the idea of the 1996 code, it's, you know, hindsight, and the rear view mirror is 2020, you know, but, so I might have recommended wording the 1996 version of RC one a little bit different. But again, where you have the problem that we have right now is when it came up to the 2017 code, it certainly seemed to eliminate all those references to the b one, b two, B three, B four, B five. And so I think the effort here is to get back to that intent that it was trying to clarify that if you had one of those, if you were one of those thousand parcels that had a commercial zoning when we adopted the comp plan, you could come in and apply for the RC one. And the RC one was intended to be just for those people that were kind of grandfathered or whatever term you want to use back then. But Mister Minter, it clearly says all undeveloped commercial parcels. There are only so many zoning classifications that mean commercial. Ken, what are they? Right. The commercial zonings to b one, b two, b three, b four, B five, RAC, which is commercial, but it's for RAC land use. And you have rural commercial. Right. It says commercial parcels. There's your key word, commercial parcels. All they did was say commercial parcels instead of saying with b one, b two, b three. Because everyone knows that that's what the zoning classificate will not, you know, in your office. The board knows what a commercial parcel means. It has to have a certain zoning classification. A one is not a commercial parcel. Correct. That's not a commercial classification. Correct? Correct. This policy does not apply to agricultural a one land as it sits today. The application that came in, we told the applicant that. And you just didn't stop them from making their application. They pushed it. Right. So, Mister Van Wagner, they told that applicant that their a one property did not fall under this policy. But the applicant made their application regardless. You're very welcome. And look, I know this is. I know how frustrated you are. And under the country code, the reason they did that was they were trying to fit a square thing into a round hole, right? I mean, they were trying to take Ag. And I put it in here because in this classification of rural commercial, gas station is listed. Right. If gas station is listed and they're trying to put a gas station in on AG, then they're trying to make this jump. And they're trying to get the board to go along with them. And we didn't go along with them. And in that reality, that's what they were trying to do. And you heard them when they testified here that they were trying to get us to believe that this was a significant agricultural need, right. That all of y'all out there, we're gonna fill up your farm tractors at the racetrack. That's basically what they were trying to say. Well, yeah, you know, maybe let's stay. But I'm just saying that's what they were trying to do. But it fundamentally didn't fit. Well, it not only did it fundamentally not fit, but that piece of property was not eligible for RC zoning based on the policy as it is written. So we are not. Whether it passes, whether it doesn't pass, regardless of what happens up here today, we're not taking anything away from any a one properties. Because a one properties today are not eligible to apply or be approved for RC zoning. I would also reiterate another point of the applicant always has the ability to apply for anything, which is exactly what they did. And we said no. So again, property rights are never going to be taken away at this point, ever. I hope so. Not with this board. Miss Coffin, before you begin, I would just like to ensure that Caroline Webster is here. She'll barely make the height over the chairs. I see her. She's making fun of you. Caroline. And Will and Katherine Baker. Very good. I see will, do. I see Kathryn, his wife, was able to attend. She's tending to an injured horse. Okay, very good. I'm so sorry. I hope the horse recovers well. Miss Cawthon, you will have six minutes, and after you give your name and address. Dana Cawthon. 150 West Highway 329, Citra Florida 32113. Just to kind of touch on something everyone's aware of, the 1980s vaccine Injury Prevention Act. Ronald Reagan, we totally got screwed on that because he gave them complete liability, freedom from liability for injury, under the promise that they were going to do the necessary research to fix the problem with the TDAP. They never did it because they got the liability free and they never circled back. That's kind of what this does. Because no one wants to address the racks. You're limiting what these partials for now. It's these ones, what they can have on them. While we're severely limited by the presence of racks, the racks are not in the right places. We're aware of that. You're aware of that, everyone's aware of that. But you want to lock us down to racks when we all know they're not in the right spots? Put that aside. He actually touched. Mister Minter actually touched on something that I was going to touch on because I wanted to establish kind of a track record on why all of us have a bad gut feeling about what's going on. July 13",

        "text": " it you know is it a fabric in the last 18 years probably not so there's a lot of unanswered questions I think um but it in the future I think they're going to continue to develop as foreseen I mean look at passenger cars they've come a long way uh in their length of travel and how efficient they are and all those kind of things uh fire trucks are just like I said they're just Bangles right now so we my recommendation was if you go with the diesel fleetness by this is that with the number of calls we're running you know we may be looking at different places linked in less than 18 years 15 into the average so we're constantly watching what's in what's in the the field um one of the things we did do with the sleep is we've replaced all the rescue tools the jaws of life used to be gasoline Motors uh hydraulic fluid through hoses that's how they've been forever the new ones are buying are all the battery power they're faster they're cheaper they're less weight uh they cut open and closed very much very quickly you can cut a whole car part so so we are we are looking at you know the technology that we can or we can Electrify things go away from it and that's that's a two-cycle motor it runs when you run that pump and so it does have emissions and carbon Footprints yeah the batteries have some too because that stuff or disposal but so we are we are experimenting where we can and where we feel it's safe to do so we're going to have an impact community that being in the form of our reviews haven't had that conversation and also just for everyone's information all of the diesel that we bring in the city when we can get it which is most of the time it's all Renewables we've been doing that for quite a few so what if we wanted to replace that and half the time I'm curious about the Visa how much impact uh the diesel engine models have on a resale value shorter period of time um probably a discussion for down the road but let's say we wanted to replace that with electric or something like that yeah I I guess what I would say is the sooner you sell something the more value it's going to have in a resale Market for somebody else to buy it I mean as an example when we sold our last week they were 18 years old and the market at that time they were about 30 000 each was only the third thousand dollars we put in America right now Fleet Italians are current trucks that we have will be worth about a hundred thousand based on the market so we'll get more money for those 2000 each yes because they do have a value so it just depends so if if you're uh you know large cities will run and sleep for 10 years and then they would have been reserved status and then they'll find um we wouldn't be able to do that at least for 10 years what I would recommend if that is a consideration is don't buy half of them and that's what I was thinking trying it out yet um the requirements for this truck battery charges electric truck battery are significantly more than a Tesla sure um and it's about 250 000 at each station for all the charges so it's not just across the truck it's the year to charge it and all that but if if that is something that we want to pursue down the road they're a million four you know now you can buy one now if you want the money keep that in the spine but you know down the road if you want to try it see how it performed and I think as as the manufacturers get better no one's built one yet that's full there's no fire truck that's full effort because it runs two hours it won't be that's that leaves 42 hours a day when you get off so uh that's not going to work you know um but if they get get one that could run a full shift or Run 10 12 14 hours on its battery then that's more about the solution and you're not using the diesel motor what's the point of running these at least getting the properties bought or we want to locate the station uh and then when Brian talks about his probably won't talk about station but we're looking at uh design in 23 uh late 23 Construction in the late 24. First Nation Station 12. 00 stations the uh Wireless purchase the land and moving forward on the northeast fire station moved up so much from what the planning was so I think that was a I think that was a draft document we did we were looking at potential for the casino to build this fire station and a Dispatch Center if the source Casino came through I don't think that's going to happen and so I didn't want to get in front of that with buying peace property build fire station and have them say hey we want to build a fire station right next to this apartment sets but now that we I think the three certain that's not going to happen so now we move that forward process I don't want to wait to move station eight uh into the city work and Bittersweet citizens uh we have the money to do it and yeah salad so it's basically just where it fits in the timeline of all the instructions so and obviously this group's going to decide you know the actual timelines we could the updates but it was it wasn't just that way right right well I went through and kind of compared them beforehand just to see if there were any kids yeah okay okay because originally I was like I don't want to get ahead of the casino I don't want to lose the opportunity to get three stations if I can because the only one for free okay thank you good morning all right one step all right I'll go ahead a few more things on schedule and let Allen Parker probably go first okay sounds good sounds good so so this is our preliminary schedule this is kind of what we started to work on but we wanted to get none of this assessments don't concrete I'll give an example we have navigation Center going on with the operations uh customer services Center out here saw our folks at Family overseas putting those projects finish the projects are all broken out by category that we're on in the bond measure and then I wanted to point out we apply so so when uh in our team they were looking at projects for example uh it's a restaurant facility which are the shelter and uh Pier Park there's a couple different so but one time too so some of that color coding and it was really trying to line things up can either match the park or maybe take a specific element so that's where you CC my color coding minimize our impact it looks like somehow the payment repair projects that uh scrambled a little bit so I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be really comfortable I'm pretty sure every day for the worker there's something about not using your personal gain what is that that's not personal no I just thought that they were done so Brad just just curious of the paper care projects what was the criteria that was used to establish the part of read the sequence I think it was well I'll let uh we're doing a project for parking lots and we put something somewhere else part of it was trying to make sure we start hitting areas across you know to spread it out a little bit is there anything else part of it too we looked at what existing utilities were underneath the road if there was any tissues with those that might need to be addressed that needed to be budgeted CIP so the projects that we have that are early on were basically once that's pretty clear to be able to move forward and you know we're trying to take advantage of good weather is that all of the playground as we get replacement so you're doing all of your playground that's a good point I think typically we look at trying to do the good weather I know weather is a big element right but appreciate that comments or at least start it sometimes the end of summer especially it's like out of my area I mean those parks in the summer that's you know excellent department so we'll try and balance that more this is one place where this community helps us right any other major changes from kind of the draft now the fire station is a big one but any other really big ships I mean there was definitely some shifting what version is this in terms of internal resources those are the ones that I remember and the utilities you've never been practically made a big factor can we go to line 53 um that's one of those buckets and I just want to make sure that I how I read this is we have 4.1 million dollars for Parks paths and trails to be determined by Council and rehab and replace and then I see that we have some in early 2023 where we could start picking up patients how much of that 4.1 million is actually available now like how like how would I be able to tell like oh we have you know a million dollars now or you know how much how can I tell how that's allocated if you get to that level of detail on most of those buckets you know why we broke them out basically kind of equal parts okay so it was it was our best guest to be able to try and get something for Josh to be able to models so give me about a million dollars the first three years so about a million dollars out of the first three years that was something I was going to ask for is just a graphic depiction of where the first 100 million dollars is that would be great yeah yeah right yeah okay I I broke I we have to actually receive the dollars each category has a separate cost so I broke it down the first three years plus a little bit of 26 times I also noticed that I'm sorry once again like 20 and 21 are similar there are more buckets with multiple multiple millions in them but we're picking locations now and so it would be exciting to be able to actually pick some you know specify some projects that we haven't actually ended up idea you know during the early stages of distance of the community can actually see some of the results we said that in the first the first three years right is the more difficult in terms of spending marketing or was it any percentage are you able to shift more money into those you know we're looking at this you know Council designated step into the position after year two where it looks up against it if",

        "text": " the inconsistencies with the comprehensive plan, I don't know that there would be enough conditions to mitigate the fact that it's not a compatible use by staff standards. Standards. Okay. With that being the nature of the use being industrial within a rural land area. So, you know, the ironic thing about this is that I'm thinking of compost USA again. But, you know, we're talking about the complex provisions about industrial uses, but there are certain types of uses that if this was proposed right in the middle of the urban service area, the board definitely wouldn't want it there. Well, even, interestingly enough, I mean, to be honest with you, when you look at it, I mean, obviously there's some modification issues because your recommendation would be to put it on the commerce park that's down the road. We're going to put it. Imagine burning on the by the commerce park next to dollar general and everything else, or burning against I 75 at the other suggested site. Both of those would be problematic, way worse than the current agricultural. So maybe we should look at this as an ag process. Well, part of what I'm thinking here is that, you know, this particular situation highlights the fact that, as everybody knows, we have very lengthy code provisions and detailed regulations as it is. But it's really impossible for a regulation to contemplate every particular individual situation. And so I think what Commissioner Zalick was just talking about certainly provides a basis to differentiate this particular application from the regulations that you're talking about. But that's up to you whether that's your decision. So guy, I think a good conversation for us to have though as we're looking at the comp plan. Again, bigger picture is this should be a piece of ag land with a special use permit. What this should be. Right. But what do you think we're going to do in the future to allow us flexibility to make these kind of decisions in even the upcoming comp plan modification? How can we fix the conundrum? I suggested at the LDRC meeting that we under special use permit listed. I put end anything we can dream up as well as. And then that way it covered everything. Would cover everything. Yeah. I think we just make a legislative decision. Commissioner. At the end of the day we've had the testimony that that proves that we need the source. It's in the right location. Because again, you wouldn't servicing that area, you wouldn't put this in the commerce park. That would definitely not be the highest and best use. And it would, it would actually imp. It would actually affect way more people than where it's at today in any one of those locations where it would technically be legal. So I think, you know, that's, that's why we're the legislative body to sit here today and make those kind of decisions and agree. Maybe it doesn't fit the comm plan, but it is in the public interest and I don't believe it conflicts with the neighbors. I agree. Sure. I just don't want us to lose sight that we're not done with the conditions. Conditions, right. So mister Minter, your concern? I mean, are you concerned that we're setting a precedent? I'm concerned because as the board is aware that the issue of consistency with the challenge or the comp plan is a critical issue for the legality of your decision. So I'm trying to give you the opportunity to articulate what your rationale is here on. On the issue of consistency. So again, I do believe based on where this property is located that it is servicing the development going on in the Marion Oaks subdivision. It makes sense for this operation to continue or to be allowed to operate for the best and highest use of this whole community. It does serve a need for the community as well as the roadways that would be impacted should those trucks leave this community. To take it off site is only going to impact our roadways in other places. And we cannot put the developer then or, excuse me, the operator responsible for the roadways across the entire county like we can in this particular location. I believe there's a safety element to it too. That's a great point. By keeping the most need the traffic in this area, instead of sending it out onto roads throughout the county that have other traffic. And these are the largest trucks that you see on your roadway system. Typically they're the largest trucks on the roadway. So keeping them out of the main public roadways is important. So have we articulated that well enough to your thoughts, Mister Mendel? I think so. Okay, very good. So we'll go back to the conditions again. We just need to make sure that the only roads that are impacted the commercial driveway aprons transitioning from the roadway to the properties again would be southwest 165th Street. I also. Or excuse me, lane Road. Yes. And then just to address the land berm issue, you were just wanting it on the eastern. The east sides is what we were requesting the commission agree with. Yes. They do not need to burn to the north of that though. Or west. They're a thousand feet away. I mean, on that north site we could do the north boundary as well, if that's what you're asking. But it's a thousand feet away. It is a very long way. I did visit this property back in March before it was ever filed. But again, up against on the east side would be most appropriate. And also it says setbacks from all property lines. It says 100ft. I mean, I think we're 300ft all. So I think we should maintain 300ft off of the 2600 acre parcel. I think that that's appropriate to push that up to 300ft. 300. Okay. We're happy with that. Don't you have to have that for the gas line anyway? I don't know. I don't. I'm not sure about that. I just know that. I mean, it said 100. I'm fine with it. We should. I mean, we should maintain the 300ft away that we are. Okay. And those hours of operation will remain the same. And how many days a week? Five. Five days a week. Monday to Friday? No, weekends. Okay. I clears do work on Saturdays. Huh? My clearing operations, they do work on Saturdays. Almost all of them. Well, it says Monday to Friday up here for conditions. I would like it for it to be Saturday if possible. I'm asking. If you say no, you say no. But I mean, I. I'm here to ask for my owner. What. What they would like. Third time Monday to Friday. Sounds like I've struck out. Okay. Is there anything else in those conditions that you saw that needed to be adjusted other than adding that developer's agreement for the roadway repair? So it was the required developers agreements being responsible for 165th posting bond within 60 days. Is that something I would also. Letter of credit or bond. Letter of credit or bond. An agreement has to be done within 60 days with the bond or letter of credit. Oh, the developer's agreement within 60 days. Okay. There was another one that we mentioned. Oh. Maintain compliance with outside agencies or possibility of revocation in the event that compliance is not. It's not a special use permit. Not revocation. It would be. It would be halting. Oh, halting of activity until those permits. Halting of activity. There we go. And they can only put tree debris on the site footprint that is in this pud. Right. That has been identified. Okay, I'll make sure that because there does there. We do have a civil culture activity that occurs thing as well. I know, but anything that you bring, bring in. It's our intent to stay within the boundaries of these areas that we designated. And there needs to be some. Is that the fire marshals job or whatever, but there needs to be some. How much overburden or stockpile there is, right. I don't know what the right. We want a stockpile basically is what you're saying. I mean, we can't exceed the boundaries of what we've defined in this zone application. Okay, well, I need. We need to give a height. You can go pretty damn high with tree debris. Yes, sir, that's correct. We can. And listen, at the end of the day, we don't want it to come to a process where we got to clean it up or you get a fire that's just out of control in a stockpile. We don't. Those are always the problem. So I don't know what that is, but can we put in the developers agreement? We can, and I think there is a condition about. So then this way we can anchor on side technical people look at it, figure out what the right thing is. Is that you? Yes. No, that's Henry Munoz. But I'm thinking if they're not more than 20 foot high, something like that. About the height of the truck. Okay, we're fine. We're fine with 20ft. I just. I want to be. Henry, are you sure? Showers, weather report. Henry, you of all people. Is it a flip phone? There we go. So again, all of the. There is an attachment here, attachment C. That's additional use for sheets with figures. And that does have the equipment, washing equipment, the dust control, prescribed burn control. All of that will be adhered to. We do prescribe burns on the farm as well. So I mean, so the fire risk is lowered by the activities that they already perform. I mean, they just burned this and Drake Ranch, 4000 acres this year. So, I mean, when they do that type of upkeep,",

        "text": " great and there have been some uh helpful comments in the chat and just to let everyone know we will be exporting the chat so we'll have this recorded rebecca will have it as she continues with the study and with that uh linda any hands up yet i haven't seen anything new come in the yes there's a steve ellis that's going to be uh that we can unmute steve you can speak now hello yes steve okay sounds good hey this is steve ellison with uh first element uh true zero brand uh that's uh building hydration stations in california and first and foremost thanks for putting this together and a lot of good work here there's a lot to and certainly you know you're taking on a i'll call it the top of the funnel uh where as you pull through it you have opportunities to move some things along faster than others so one of my comments was when i hear the word study and i heard it a lot often that is uh often too often a excuse for delay and i don't mean that in a negative sense but rather you can study things to death while maybe in some areas the work has already been done and you can simply look to your left or right in other words another state and see what they're doing and that's i would just say an opportunity for you uh second is on this point about the i did comment on that back to ken and said while it's true about the energy density and his contention it takes more trucks to move it than another fuel the vehicles keep in mind in the purpose of transportation two to three times more efficient than a comparable internal combustion and so this assumes use of either light duty or heavy duty with a fuel cell therefore they travel a lot further per let's just say the gasoline gallon amount of fuel so in other words it takes a lot less for a uh equivalent number of miles when used in a fuel cell vehicle so in it does not take let's just say three times more trucks of fuel to serve the number of vehicles just wanted to comment on that thank you so much um to your first point about you know study versus action uh that's certainly very well taken um you know i think that because this is such a new area and this is just my guess is that the legislature wanted to get a little bit better of a handle on it but that said obviously things are going to keep moving forward even if oregon were to decide to keep doing studies you know especially with as i mentioned the federal infrastructure bill there's funding in there for example for hydrogen hubs for renewable hydrogen at ports and so you know we're just gonna see projects um in advance probably a policy as we then try to figure out what policy we need to to um you know to meet the goals that we okay great thank you and i'll just give an example in the northeast states they've been studying for 10 years um about six to eight years ago i myself was back there talking with different uh uh coalition of states and uh one of my points in testimony was that by time you figure it out it's too late and here we are today they still don't have a network of stations um uh capable of supporting vehicle transportation while many people have done a lot of work to try to enable that so that's just my constructive caution that there can be things you do quickly for action while maybe some of the larger scale projects and things like that will continue to need studies so i think you got the right balance there thank you thank you steve rebecca we've had a few more questions come in through the chat so i'll start with abraham mooney asks will biomass to hydrogen via smr or other thermal conversion be considered in the study great question and so you know that was um so when you said smr so um small modular reactor that means nuclear i'm assuming um oh i'm assuming that you that's what you mean instead of steal um c methane reformation or maybe i'm wrong just too many acronyms to assume the um abraham just clarified uh steam methane reformation okay okay good sorry abraham so yes so you know looking at those um looking at those potential pathways for renewable production of hydrogen we are going to look at those uh in the study because using an electrolyzer is not the only pathway and it may it may turn out to be the best pathway it may turn out to be the most cost-effective pathway most efficient i don't know um but certainly we have a lot of biomass uh resources in oregon and so the study will look at uh pathways beyond just the electrolyzer and then chris kroker asks given the definition of renewable hydrogen being hydrogen that does not emit green greenhouse gases will this include blue hydrogen then produced from partial oxidation processes where 99 of carbon is captured this process arguably has emissions on par with green hydrogen produced from a variable grid mix that's a really great question chris and this is something that certainly as i read through the bill and the definition um you know i had some questions about so going back to that definition um hydrogen gas derived from energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases um so does that mean that um blue hydrogen that was developed from a fossil fuel but then had some sort of carbon capture associated with it or some other way of mitigating those greenhouse gas emissions would that qualify as renewable hydrogen under this definition um also would you know uh hydrogen production powered by a nuclear energy would that also count and so these are questions that we plan to raise in the study um and so certainly consider what some of those pathways look like raise some of the considerations that we need to make to determine whether or not we as a state want to want to have those pathways included in our definition of renewable or clean hydrogen or not certainly as i mentioned the industry is very much moving towards a carbon intensity approach and so um you know there are pathways that involve fossil fuels that could have a relatively low carbon intensity so you know if if that's the way that the industry ends up going it's certainly valuable for oregon to consider the ramifications on of that on you know in our state and in our decarbonization so a couple of clarifying or related questions uh jason modi asks does greenhouse gas when we say greenhouse gases are we including oxides of that is um you know another great question so we've certainly got you know the big six and then we've also got some short-lived climate pollutants i think that these are all questions that we should raise in this study just about you know these are things to think about when we choose to define what this resource is you know how do we define whether it's renewable or not how do we define what we include as a greenhouse gas or not because we do have options and then niko become and i apologize nico if i said your name incorrectly uh you answered this a little bit rebecca but can you talk about how carbon intensity scores will play a part in the study yeah that's that's a great question as well um you know certainly we will be looking at what the carbon intensities have been assumed to be for certain pathways of of hydrogen and renewable hydrogen if there are pathways we find that seem uh reasonable and that they seem like they might be commercialized within by maybe that 20 30 date that we have in the study um that they kind of applied to one part of the requirements but i think it's can be kind of overall a good date to look at in terms of what's going to happen with renewable hydrogen in the near term or what's likely and so in terms of what data is available out there on the carbon intensities of different pathways we will certainly include that um there may not be data on all of those or there may be you know questions about that data and assumptions about them so certainly there's been a lot of assumptions about the emissions associated um you know with blue hydrogen and so that's part of what we're also going to call on our um our third party unbiased technical about is in terms of helping us parse some of that data you know is this a reasonable carbon intensity figure does this make sense or were there assumptions in the development of this that we really need to be aware of okay one more question from chat and then i think we may have a hand or two um for also from ken when looking at existing uses of hydrogen will uses such as ammonia and fossil fuels consumption be included since hydrogen is used in the manufacturing of those project products although not an organ now i would certainly like to i think that that part of that question comes down to capacity and data availability um you know if we have time to really kind of expand how we define hydrogen for that inventory then i think it would be really valuable to include that information and then certainly the second question is how much data we're able to get on that and how so the question is so the answer is that seems like a fair answer at this point in the study um i thought i saw a handout but i'm not sure now linda anybody anybody with hands up right now we did have a just justine moody would you like to um engage uh just a quick question on decarbonization can you hear me yes justin right so back to the uh decarbonization you know of flexible resources we have existing flexible resources that use gas right what about blending gas to decarbonize those flexible resources would that be addressed in the study that's the first question the second is on diesel uh there's so much diesel in this world and can we also look at how we can replace diesel with hydrogen for backup generation and other manufacturing plants that use backup thank you those are those are great questions um and so first in terms of the um of the decarbonization and certainly um one of the study requirements is that we look at um sorry i'm just going back a slide um so it asks us to identification of potential applications of renewable hydrogen oregon by and so there are a lot of things that could fall under that and so i think blending that renewable hydrogen you know into um you know a mix of for example of natural gas to go into a turbine where maybe there's 10 15 20 percent hydrogen um is is something that we'll look at as a potential application simply because that is within the universe of of possibilities for kind of that that",

good morning everyone and thank you for uh we'll we'll just start right now and i want to pass this to our agency director jeanne benner to welcome you good morning everyone can you hear me all right michael can you give me a thumbs up yep okay thanks um well i just want to kick off the meeting this morning by saying thank you we really appreciate you spending time with us here this morning to talk about how the department of energy can help wildfire survivors with energy and we hope that you'll be willing to share your thoughts with us on how we can design a program that will work well for survivors as michael said my name is janine benner and i'm the director of the department of energy in oregon and on the line with us today are a number of my colleagues from the department so michael freels is leading our efforts to design and launch the program christy split heads up our government relations work and she'll be monitoring and facilitating the q a on this call and andy cameron heads up our energy efficiency and conservation team we've got a number of other folks on the line to take notes and help answer and i think we are also going to be joined this morning by andy boulton who's an analyst at the building codes division who will also share a bit about his agency's efforts are on wildfire recovery oh there's andy thanks for joining us andy so we're hoping to have an interactive meeting this morning with lots of questions and feedback from attendees and michael will walk you through how to engage with us on that shortly and i also want to make sure that you are aware that this meeting is being next slide please michael so before we jump into the meeting i do want to take a minute and just let you know about the oregon department of energy for those of you who aren't and what you see on the screen now is our vision our mission and how we achieve that mission so at the oregon department of energy we help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future providing support for wildfire survivors to rebuild in a way that saves them energy and money will contribute towards a safe equitable clean and sustainable and it's our hope that this program can help make life at least a little bit easier for survivors in terms of energy efficiency and i'm personally glad that the department of energy can play a small role in the recovery so now i will turn it over to michael to give you a sense of the agenda for today's meeting and how you can engage in the conversation thank you good morning okay so today we've got a stacked agenda so we'll be using our webex platform and so we're going to take a couple of minutes to kind of talk about the logistics and how to properly use the webex platform because we certainly we're here to listen to everybody we want every everybody to be able to engage um and so then we'll talk about kind of our schedule of the meetings this meeting previously previous meetings we've had and some future meetings that we'd like people to attend and we'll talk through our wildfire recovery legislation what's brought us here for this discussion and kind of our initial ideas and plans vision for what a program might look like but we're certainly still fielding feedback and want to hear from everyone to help us with the program and as janine pointed out we've got andy bolton here to talk about dcps's wildfire hardening program which is a great program that's going to be aligned with what we're offering and we'll walk through what that looks like but hopefully we'll have quite a bit of time at the end kind of an open forum we've got a lot of great questions for this group but please don't feel limited by our questions we'd love to hear your questions or general feedback and how rebuilding is going for you uh thoughts you have about kind of our program design and and just uh we'd love to hear about your experiences and janine pointed out that this is being recorded and it will be available online afterwards and previous meetings we've had are available uh online as well so here is a screenshot of what webex looks like hopefully this looks very similar to what you see right now and please notice you can see who the panelists are in the upper right and that you can raise your hand so right now we we are doing an event where everyone's muted at this time so we can kind of talk but if you have something to say please raise your hand and uh christy will call on you and we'll we'll hear what you have to say if you have a question or a statement or anything you'd like to kind of contribute to the conversation we certainly want to encourage that we're here to listen uh so q and a as as janine pointed out we've got over to the right we've got a q a function where you can write questions within the group please send it to everybody so we can all see the questions and and bring those up within the discussion and talk through with them if it's more comfortable for you instead of raising your hand and speaking to put something in the q a that's great we'd love to hear from you that way we also we'll talk about in a little bit we also have a public comment portal this is another opportunity for you to offer feedback and so there's a lot of different means to to provide feedback on this process and we'd love to hear from you so this is one of a series of community obviously we had wildfires all over the state and so we want to have some regional meetings to talk to everyone so last week we talked to the oregon coastal area and mckinsey river lane county area obviously right now we're talking the san diego county marion county area later this week we're going to talk to talk to southern oregon but also please don't feel limited by that if you know somebody a community member who's really interested in this stuff and and couldn't make this meeting please come to our our southern oregon meeting it's not going to be limited uh by just people from southern oregon we'd love to have you all these kind of community meetings will uh will feed a final kind of rulemaking meeting that we'll have at the end on uh november 9th so we at that point we'd love to kind of talk through here's what we've heard from everybody here's we're thinking of some initial kind of rule making rules around what we're going to design and uh and it's an opportunity to provide feedback again if we misheard something if you want to reiterate some feedback or you weren't able to attend some of the earlier meetings that's a great one to attend as well so there's lots of opportunity to provide feedback and if you see in that lower right we have a little link there for our public comment portal and so we'll we'll talk about that then and we actually put that in the q a if people if it's easier for people to get that link that way so the reason we're here unfortunately in 2020 there were 21 fires across the high winds a variety of different factors led to some destructive wildfires we lost over a million acres of of land and over 5000 structures were destroyed in oregon unfortunately so in the 2021 legislature some uh some bills were or enacted in order to help with that wildfire recovery uh during the meeting today we're really hoping to listen to people and hear about the recovery efforts as obviously we're focused on san diego canyon the mary county area we'd love to hear everyone's experiences with that and what they've experienced and and what they've heard and how the recovery efforts are going because that will certainly inform what we want to design and how we can help people as best we christy can you talk a little bit about the legislation i sure can good morning so in response to the wildfires that happened in 2020 the oregon legislature got to work and that includes legislators representing the cnem canyon and legislators throughout the state working together to figure out how to respond so that the state could support recovery efforts and it's not and while it's to support individuals it's also meant to support rebuilding communities and in that vein house bill 2289 was put together which was essentially intended to streamline the rebuilding process to make it easier in a variety of different ways for people to rebuild their homes or for homes to rebuild where ones had burned down during the fires and that also included commercial structures not just homes and also addressed manufactured homes as you may know many of the homes lost at many of the locations for manufactured homes and so that bill was put together by a big work group of folks and one of the things they decided to do was to take a look at oregon's energy code or um building code and oregon has a um a building code that has standards for energy efficiency and we have through the years increased energy efficiency in new construction at an incremental level right and so if you had an older home that was lost during the fires your home would not have been as energy efficient as a home built now however there was concern that building to the new code would make things more expensive than it would be to rebuild the exact same existing structure and so there was a decision made to allow folks under house bill 2289 to rebuild structures at the code the building code that was in place in 2008 and so with that move made there was also a conversation at that same table to figure out well how could we incentivize people to build to the current code so that their new homes would be as efficient as other new homes we know this saves people money on their bills in the long run and it's better for the environment and so there's a win-win there so the decision was made that perhaps there could be an incentive program at the oregon department of uh that would support rebuilding and what happened is um the bill house bill 2289 did not contain that provision but at the very end of session there's always a bill that passes we call it the christmas tree bill at the capitol and it includes",

        "text": " of carbon pricing are project types and the co- benefits of the projects but also location and that is why we see a lot of demand for projects in the Pacific Northwest and California because there are so many large tech companies and other companies based out of those areas who want to supply carbon dollars to local projects next slide please and the other big change um the past two years in the voluntary carbon Market is there are a lot more standards being developed so these are overreaching standards they're the Integrity Council for voluntary carbon markets the task force on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the voluntary carbon Market Integrity initiative and what these organizations are doing is they are coming up with standards that those Registries the governing bodies are all supposed to review and adopt and the hope is that it increases transparency for buyers or end users like the facilities so when you receive an offset from American carbon registry or climate action Reserve you know that both of those offsets are following the same set standards of rules next slide please and just wanted to put up here the climate trust team I think what the first year I presented there was just four of us and we have grown now to have 13 employees our focus of our growth today is on Project de development and then also Business Development on increasing the amount of offsets that we are selling and buying on the volun carbon market and the compliance market and next slide please and lastly I put up the board of directors up here we have from fsec Brad Hunter and cdy Conan and Terence Chapman is the site certificate holder this group we within this group of board of directors we do have a risk committee and that risk committee is where we bring projects that we would like to supply to the or CO2 program and they evaluate the contracts that we have completed and they also look at the Integrity of the offsets that we would like to supply the pro uh to the program and approve the purchase of those offsets on behalf of the program after the risk committee the full board then votes on the contracts for us to purchase offsets uh to supply to the Oregon CO2 standard and next slide yep and with that um that was was my overview of the spend down and my email is up there if any of you have any questions but also I'm open for questions right now about the status of program thank you for your presentation we have council member Condon with a comment or question thank you chair Grail and thank you Kyler for um presenting I um just have uh a question more from Curiosity so there's been um quite a bit of cress I've read and heard with respect to carbon credits in their or offsets rather um and the effectiveness of them and some questioning of if offsets work and I was just wondering if you could maybe speak that you know what you're hearing what um the industry is uh dealing with there just to separate back from fiction yeah a good question yeah that is something that is coming up a lot and that goes back to the Integrity of the market so in the past couple of years there's been a lot of growth in the voluntary market and we have seen a lot of new developers buyers and investors in these projects and it's important to differentiate between what makes a a high quality carbon offset and what would not be considered a high quality carbon offset what that goes back to is um working with those Registries that I mentioned before so the American carbon registry and the climate action reserve and Vera because they are developing stringent protocols um for how you quantify the emission reduction from a project and then the next governing body would be those new standards that are being developed like core carbon principles which will be overarching of all carbon offset projects I think a lot of the press that is um the articles that are being mentioned today a lot of the offsets that they are looking at are not registered under one of those governing bodies um or under one of those standards that's the difference is for buyers to be aware of of if you're looking at an entity and inhouse they are doing it all so they have their own protocol they own have their own project type and their own registry that would be a red flag but with our projects we're not issuing any offsets so we can't have bu s for that that would be on one of the Registries and then also were third partti audited and the protocols are developed outside so let's say the climate trust was making our own protocols and developing our own protocols and issuing our own offsets that would be a red flag um that would not not could mean that the offsets were not of high integrity um and one other point on that there was a really great article that came out recently that showed that uh the major corporations who are purchasing carbon offsets carbon offsets are a really tiny part of their climate action plan so the notion that some companies are out there buying offsets to offset 100% of their emissions is actually just wasn't found in any of the review of these companies climate action plans thank you for that thank you any other questions comments well thank you very much for joining us today and we will look forward to learning more about the work you're doing great thank you for your time all all right our next agenda wow we are right on schedule uh our next agenda item is our annual compliance overview this is an information item we have Dwayne kilsdonk Odo compliance officer and Sarah esterson odo's senior policy advisor to provide council with an update on compliance program activities I was thank you um everyone our uh lunch is here and since we're planning on doing a working lunch how about we take 10 Sarah that's okay we take 10 minutes and we get our lunch and then we can continue on if everyone's all right so we are going to recess for minutes okay the time is now 11:10 and we are going to resume our meeting we have the annual compliance review agenda item F Dwayne killson Odo compliance officer and Sarah esterson Odo senior policy advisor are here to provide council with a update on morning okay good mid morning chair Grail and members of the council again my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy advisor in the sighting Division and with me is uh our colleague and sighting division's compliance officer killon so the goals of our presentation today are to Pro provide you an overview of the compliance program and to highlight some of the changes we've been implementing over the last few years we'll also touch on some of the challenges of the compliance program and some of our ideas for solutions that we'd like to just throw out there to get your feedback on next slide please please so the overall mission of the compliance program is fairly straightforward it's to regulate and enforce the terms and conditions of site certificates that you issue you as the council a site certificate has on average over a 100 conditions Council has 41 active site certificates today if you want to do the math that's over 4,000 conditions uh that the compliance program is for plug for a solution uh when you are tasked with reviewing a draft proposed order in that draft proposed order embedded within each evaluation of a standard are conditions that staff recommend and then at the end of that typically 250 page document all conditions are Consolidated into an attachment look at those conditions ask your yourself is this really needed is this redundant is it clear um because those are the questions that we're asking in the compliance program as we sift through 4,000 um okay so site certificates contain requirements that apply at different points in time those points in time are preconstruction construction and operation and because these phases can happen simultaneously across projects one of the changes we've been trying to implement internally is to delineate these phases in task management in recordkeeping um and in responsibilities so preconstruction as a phase generally I have been managing and support with the the additional compliance officer position that we have we don't have that filled right right now but we are interested in getting that filled the next phase is construction um that phase is typically I am significantly supporting that phase we get help from a senior sighting analyst but that's pretty challenging given our workload and with support and inspections from our environmental consultant Halen Aldrich and then in operations which is really the biggest long-term phase of a facility uh and a a site certificate um is our um lead compliance officer and Dwayne kilsdonk that's also supported in part by our environmental consultant Aldrich uh there's also another subpart of the compliance program which we call as incident reporting this is difficult to predict but it's a requirement and Rule and off often Insight certificates where a certificate holder has to report an event like a fire or equipment malfunction that resulted in an environmental impact like a spill or an explosion worst case scenario and then we track that we evaluate whether we think it is an issue of non-compliance or just limited to an incident either way depending on the significance we track remediation of the shair yes sah thanks um quick question under the construction phase are they complying with local building permits or is that really not even a review that they do it's more of an FC review so electrical and building code and Associated permits are outside of FC jurisdiction right um I think the closest we get is like conditional use permit and Zoning permits we require that those be obtained and demonstrated to us so they're being inspected by the county building inspector and electrical inspectors sorry this is uh Dwayne killstone compliance officer greetings greetings uh chair gr and uh other council members uh so um yes so cardi Generating Station when they built their little um built a maintenance building uh and office space both um they did have uh their building permit and they had an inspected and then all of a sudden they had their electrical permit that was you know that they came on on site and inspected so both those um were outside or the county inspectors so yeah they get they get that inspection as well yeah yeah I mean one question we often ask in inspections where site certificates have um requirements that sort of Punt to other regulations like the National Electric Safety Code or a a code of Federal Regulation that applies to natural gas pipelines we would often ask who have you had to report to or been inspected by in the last year and we want to know what their findings were because the site certificate connects us to that but then we would defer to their",

        "text": " resource build um and the the types of of supply chain expansion that we would see so as modelers what we want to end up with is is kind of a A playbook for what we should do following the the working group uh process so we want to distill all of the information that we get and the um the the refined questions getting down to those five additional scenarios in addition to the reference case and and develop what their quantitative definitions are and this is an example of that Playbook that comes from the Washington 2021 state energy strategy um where we had a a reference scenario which was kind of the the the the older idea of having a a business as usual be a a fossil future and then the all of the rest of scenarios are meeting the um the emissions goals in Washington uh the electrification scenario in this case was kind of like the reference scenario we're proposing in in Oregon and then we can see how the other scenarios are changed from that that reference scenario so taking for example Transportation fuels there where we're moving more slowly on electrification and vehicles we can see the differences in that scenario that we're used to investigate uh what would it mean to go more slowly highlighted in the red text there so instead of 100% electric sales by 2035 we're going to 75% by 2045 for example um so this is this is only in the example um and and not indicative of any of the choices that we would be making here in Oregon um but illustrating where we would like to end up uh come September after the working group process and and we've decided what are the important questions to answer and what does that mean in terms of uh scenario definitions so following our modeling work um we will get into some additional analysis that is looking at Cross cutting Equity considerations um the first of these is is energy burden and affordability and the idea here is to look at the energy wallet for a variety of of different customer profiles across Oregon um so not just focused on electricity but all of the types of of energy um expenses that customers acrew over the course of a year and the right hand side there is showing an examp example from our analysis in Wisconsin where the top chart has estimated energy expenditures by household and we see how those vary across different scenarios so Baseline we are we are spending a similar amount in 2050 to what we are in 2022 this is a kind of a fossil scenario and then we have other scenarios that are either going to clean electricity targets or Net Zero economy wide targets and uh those have VAR varied level of electrification so we see in a net zero economy wide case then we're getting about a 20% reduction in our expenditures by by 2050 but the distribution of costs are changing from largely fossil in 2022 to largely electricity costs in in 2050 as occurs so that's shown for an average customer there um but we can also look at things that that that impact particular customer groups um and and apply this to the the the bills and the likely expenses that customers such as um low-income rural customers or or low um uh customers in in Portland for example what are they going to see with with changing energy usage over time and and um these emissions Target in the future the chart on the bottom there is showing the changes in costs associated with when customer buys an electric vehicle so if they buy it in 2022 their costs are significantly higher than an average customer if they buy it in 2030 that's kind of the sweet spot where they actually save money over time but if they buy an electric vehicle later than that then their costs actually increase on a life cycle basis and so this kind of analysis analysis can illuminate um based on when a customer invests in these Technologies can they afford to invest in these Technologies what kind of impact will it have on energy spending and also given customer profiles what is the impact on energy burden for these customers the second cross cutting analysis here is air quality modeling where our energy Pathways and Real Models plug into EPA Cobra and they develop what are the the impacts on air quality over time from reductions in in fossil fuel use and that translates into changes in air quality to health outcomes to economic benefits and then we'll be doing uh geospatial mapping so using publicly available data sets to understand Community level energy inequities in relationships to socioeconomic disparities so mapping where are the low customers in the state what kind of um Equity impacts those customers are are potentially likely to see and we can pair this with our energy wallet analysis to to show where archetypal customer groups are located throughout Oregon um the the type of metrics that that will be used in this analysis are are still in development but these could include for example the energy burden poverty level access to Internet rural classification and others and then the final piece is economic and employment effects so we'll be conducting a literature review of past studies in Oregon and other states and one recent study uh came from CTI um in in the net zero Northwest Workforce data analysis that's one thing that that we can draw upon in this analysis it was conducted for Oregon um and then drawing on other studies as well as recommended by oo and as we go into this working grou group uh process what studies would would people recommend us looking at to to draw from for the um employment effects so I will uh leave it there and pass it back to Ben great thanks Jeremy so there's been a let me I'll just note we have 100 looks like 135 folks um participating and a number of questions that have come through the chat I'm going to start Sam you had raised your hand early on so I'm going to call on you and then I'm switch into some of the chat questions and responses and then we'll come to back to Brandon so at this point if folks want to raise their hand we'll get you in the queue you can add um questions into the chat and we'll do our best to get to as much as we can so Sam can we um unmute you there you are ask your question you're on mute though Sam if you're talking to us Sam may not have been ready to ask this question yet so Sam Sam we'll come back to you in a minute if uh you're hearing us so why don't we jump into the chat so uh Dave had a question around the level of detail the modeling can get into for example will the modeling scenarios compare whether BPA joins I don't know if it's case so that's the pronunciation or SP day ahead markets I'll just jump in and say that I think we um we might have typed in a quick response which is that um that's outside of the scope of the modeling I would just ask whether Jeremy would want to add anything to that well maybe Jeremy before you go there's actually several questions that seem to be related to the scope of modeling some have been answered in the chat but if you could speak maybe broadly I don't know if you can see the chat Jeremy um if you could do a quick scan I'm going to ask Sam Sam you back all right Sam we tried so Jeremy's doing a scan I think there's several questions around scope some of them have been been answered already but could you speak to kind of the capabilities and scope and what the modeling can and do sure yeah so in terms of of uh BPA joining uh Cal ISO or SP day head markets that's that's something that we we don't consider in a model because it is a it's a physical representation model um where we you could consider the the system operator um being a benevolent uh westwide system operator and and that works well for a long-term analysis when we're going out to 2050 um just because we want to look at what are the the ideal um outcomes and operations for an energy system in the future um and kind of so setting ourselves a target for what could be achieved through the the different mechanisms that are available to us today um so we can think in the long term of of everything that is is currently um the way that we operate markets or regulate markets right now as um as things that serve us they are they are mechanisms that that should be suited to the way that our Energy System looks and if they're not serving us as we move forward into a a decarbonized future or higher renewable future then um those would be levers to pool and change um so we're trying to to level up above that a little bit and look at if things were dispatched ideally what would the outcome look like um and I think that the the processes that you're highlighting there are efforts that are in somewhat in response to changes that we're seeing already in the marketplace right thank you let's let's go to Brandon uh who has a hand raised and then Jeremy as we're doing I just keep scanning the some of the questions I'll I'll work through them Brandon can you unmute and ask your all let's see if we can get someone who can speak out loud Eric strid let's try that hope it's on a technical issue here Eric can you yeah successful ask your question please uh this my question is this modeling uh cently relies on data and calculations that are all proprietary to eer in the Quest for openness and transparencies to what degree can we trust all this modeling how do we know the accuracy or gaps in the data or unintentional biases of the inputs or the interpretations for example how well does the ER model agree with other tools that are available some of which are just o open source and online thank you so all of the data that is that is going into it will be uh public and um and that that is actually a process that we've we've gone through the the last few weeks of identifying what are the data sets that are specific to Oregon that are going to be um give us the best character characterization for the state so the the data inputs and assumptions will will all be uh transparent and and open at the end of the process here and you'll see in the working groups the the ones that are being used if you have um Alternatives that we should be using then then please bring those up in the in the working group sessions um the the models themselves they are they are proprietary um and the challenge there is that you know it is it is our um IP um but they they also in terms of the open-source",

        "text": " the consensus at that time that we will determine a period of time during the development, how many number of lots are developed, then we will enact. No, but we never came back with anything, and it's still being discussed. The problem is we don't want it to be discussed. The problem is if you convey one lot, you cannot just assess one lot. Why can't we? Who says we'll try it? You cannot assess one lot, I think. Who says? Okay, I mean, if you bring us back that back, I mean, that's fine, but we'll discuss the legality other than. Okay, well, hold on a minute then. Why can't we set a sliding scale? Year one, year two, year three, year four. Within reason. That would bring them to that full assessment. Based on what we approximate, the amount of time for that thing to fill up would be because probably you can do, I mean, doing it this way, it totally defeats the purpose of the reason that we put this policy into place. Place. So can you just bring us back the options of what we can do and what we can enact? This way we can just go back through and, I mean, they should not be. I don't have any idea how they're getting to 96. How the heck are we letting that happen? Get a 96% full or over 50? It was never supposed to go over 50. I know we had that conversation, commissioners. So Matt has been looking in this. He and I have been talking about options. Your old county standard, and that was a very traditional standard used throughout Florida, was a minimum of two years and 60% occupancy. And then that was when the takeover standard would happen. But that was for public road networks, so we didn't even do that. Well, we didn't, but I don't know that you've reached your two years on some of these. Even some of them have filled up that fasten. But that kept the developer dealing with minor miscellaneous issues that were not great construction issues during that two year time period. So those are the things that Matt and I have been talking about. And we wanted the package and come back as a workshop. So another thing that we could possibly do is you could give it, you know, certain x amount of years, and that assessment is zero. Zero. And we know at year five we're hitting full assessment. We could look at it. That's the way to adopt the resolution. As soon as you adopt the ordinance put the resolution in place. I mean, because. Yeah, and it's already adopted. When we're doing these subdivisions, it's already done. And that way the potential buyer knows that this is coming. I just think there needs to be a mechanic. I like that. I like all of those suggestions. What I just think we need to do do is, like you said, still send them out assessment bill saying here's, you're still under whatever warranty period up to this time, two years or whatever the thing is, and after that your assessment is going to start. Here's the whole thing. And each MSTU needs to have that notice sent to them every year. Well, the assessment needs to go ahead and be in place because that way when it's transferred, we need to figure out is it on the tax bill to figure out what triggers them having to disclose this at the time of closing. I mean, that's my biggest concern is making sure that the potential buyer understands that this assessment is coming and that they don't come back to this board and think that it's a new assessment that we're putting on them because that's not, that was never the intention of doing this. RMST department does put these, each individual subdivision on the notice of intent that's sent out each year just with the intent of being able to collect at some point. It could be at that part of the year or the next year. So that's part of the notice of intent and all of the subdivisions are listed on there. But the problem is that they're going to have to. And the people are getting it. Yes, sir. So each person would individually get it by mail. Yes, but the problem with that, Matt, is, and the rest of the board is that we're giving them a notice of intent and then they're going to have to come back here for a public hearing. And no matter how you say it to them, this is a new tax that the county is putting on them and they don't understand that the process was put in place when the subdivision was being considered. It needs to happen before they move in. So on these like this, what we're doing here at this point, right. As soon as they switch over, they need to be getting some kind of assessment or at least what switched. Everything needs to be put into place when we are approving it. Right. These public hearings. I mean, but he said as soon as it switched over, as soon as it switched over to a sale from the developer, we got to figure it out. But as soon as they, I mean, because if they were in a part of a homeowner association paying the fee as soon as they moved in. They will be paying the fees on every lot, whether it's improved or not. Yep. And we elected not to do that. Well, that was a mistake on our part. I agree with the, probably the phased in approach. Put the resolution in place and whether it's vacant or improved, start collecting fees on those parcels. And we start with something minor. This way it's from the developer. I don't think that's fair. They put all the infrastructure in. Well, that way. That's the reason you go to a sliding scale. Sliding scale. And by year five, you've implemented the full fee. Or you go to year five, we start working. Go to year five and you start implementing the full fee. There's nothing. Year 1234, and by five we have to do something. My suggestion is let's bring you the twelve subdivision that they already quickly and see how that discussion go, and we may do. If you want a workshop, if you have different ideas you want to vet out first, we're not going to solve. I'm not necessarily sure we need a workshop. You guys need to go, you know what we want. Put some, put some different options together for us and come meet with us, and then if we need a workshop, we'll workshop it. It was just mentioned if we do a workshop. That's why I said, I said no, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. That's the pleasure. You are the enforcer, so I'll follow what you said. Work it out. Get back with us, and let's move the agenda forward. Okay. Any other comments? Hate to ask that anyone in the audience that wants to address this item, move for approval. Motioned by Commissioner Zalak. For approval, seconded by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor say aye. Aye. That motion passes unanimously. All right. 6.3. Proof of publication. I have proof of publication of legal ad number 896-7199 entitled Notice of Public Hearing published in the Star banner newspaper on June 28, 2023. This public hearing is discussed Clear Lake Ranch's Hamlet subdivision MSBU. You'll see here the area identified as Clear Lake Ranch's Hamlet subdivision development, recorded in platbook 15, pages 146 through 148. It's located in district one. This public hearing is associated with the proposed adoption of an ordinance for the Clear Lake branches Hamlet subdivision MSBU for general maintenance and capital improvements. And this creation is per the land development Code. Purpose of this MSBU would be for general maintenance and capital improvements. There are 13 parcels located within this development. I'll open it up to any questions from the commissioners. Cash that out. All right. Questions? Comments? Anyone in the audience want to address this item? Okay, back to the commission for action vote moved 2nd. 2nd motioned by Commissioner Zalak for approval. Seconded by Commissioner Stone. Any comments? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Like sign that motion passes unanimously and our final hearing 6.4. Proof of publication I have proof of publication of legal ad 89440 entitled First Public Notice Substantial Amendment to the Marion County Community Services 2019 to 2024. HUD five year Consolidated Plan and Marion County Community Services 2023 2024 Annual Action Plan published in the Star Banner newspaper on June 16, 2023. Good morning, Commissioners. Cheryl Martin, Community Services Director this is the first of two public hearings to consider changes in our substantial to consider changes in our five year consolidated plan. Per our workshop we had back in December, we are just adding clearance and demo activity for blighted areas with our CDBG dollars and with our action plan for 23 24. This is again required for our citizen participation plan to consider activities that we would fund specifically with CDBG, home and ESG to serve low income census tract areas, homeless services, and increase our supply of housing. We have an available allocation of approximately $6 million. We've already run the request for application for this cycle. This is a 30 day public comment period. It began July 1. It ends July 30. The second public and final public hearing will be on August 1, and the plans will be submitted to HUD on August 15. Questions or comments? I do. Yep. So, Cheryl, does this accomplish the goals we continue to talk about? Yes, but I want to make sure, and I know that the clearing and demo is some of the things that we did want to add and accomplish for specific areas. Correct. And",

        "text": " everything up to spec as it needs to be legal. Other than that, Mister Jeremy Howard and M. Elizabeth Howard are here to address the board, staff is recommending approval with conditions with 35. 35. Yes, sir. Okay, if the hours would like to come up. Have you stated your name and address? Jeremy Howard. The address is 3222 Southeast 110th street in Ocala, Florida. Okay, me make up? Guess. So. We've been here for five years and we own quality puppies. Prior to quality puppies, we've done rescue work. So we just wanted to provide top quality puppies to happy families. So we had our kennel custom built. When we did it, there wasn't an ordinance that was in place. And so when we found out about the ordinance, we've been there for five years, I believe it was three years. Then we built out a state of the art kennel just for the approval of this process. I noticed in the complaints it was about four things that were complained about. Should I address those now or should? That's up to you if you'd like to address it. Okay. The four things. One I noticed in the complaints, we were referred to often as a puppy mill. A puppy mill. We're completely against the puppy mill operation. It puts the breeding of dogs before their health and their care. Anyone that's been to our kennel, Mister Oham's been to our kennel, animal service has been to our kennel, and they've said things like, they're very impressed with the setup. We spent a lot of money in the kennel. The dogs get exercise. Some of the complaints say that they. They're chained up. None of our dogs are ever on a chain, that they're left outside. They can go in and out whenever they like. It's air conditioned. I mean, I could live in the kennel if I could. We did it that way so that the dogs are happy and that they're taken care of. And we have a full time worker that takes care of the dogs around the clock. The second thing was the smell. There's never any smell that comes from our kennel. It's cleaned every single day, inside and out. So, I mean, unless you're actually cleaning the kennel, we live, you know, our house is about 400ft from the Kettnele, and then we have another little house that's there. We never, ever, ever smell. There's no smell or anything like that, as far as sound. Sometimes the dogs are noisy, especially in the morning when you let them out and they run. That was specifically one of the reasons we moved to a one. When we first got there, we heard neighbor shooting guns, we heard loud concerts, and we said, this is a good place because our dogs can bark. They don't bark around the clock, but in the morning when we let them out, then, yeah, you'll definitely hear some barking at night. Out of consideration for our neighbors, around 637 o'clock, we lock them up and the building'soundproof so you don't hear anything. You can be standing right in front of the kennel and you wouldn't hear anything. So the lights, we put up lights because sometimes we have to go out there at night if puppies are being born, or sometimes just to check on little puppies. So we put up lights just to make sure we can see's. We didn't want to step on a snake or something like that. We didn't take into consideration that the lights would negatively affect anyone. So mean that was brought to our attention. We said, absolutely, we'll make whatever adjustments. Our main consideration for how we did everything with this kennel was with our neighbors in mind. We didn't want to offend our neighbors, and so I just wanted to address those things. And so if there's any other adjustments we need to make, we'll be happy to make. Have you had an opportunity to see staff's recommendations? Yes. And are you in agreement with the staff's recommendations? Absolutely. How many dogs do you have right now at the cattle right now or on a normal basis? Our adult dogs are about 25 right now, but with puppies, we have about four litters of dogs right now. So probably somewhere around 55 dogs right now. 55. But your permits, you're looking for 35. 35 adult adult dogs. The puppies don't stay with us at eight weeks old, they're sold and they go to their home. Mister Chairman, that's written in as breeding animals is how we turn that. Right. Anyone else have any questions? How often are the cages clean? Is it daily or every single day? And that's where it would be noisy. We have an employee that's out there between 07:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every day. So the cages are completely clean. That's taken to a certain area, taken off the premises? Yes. Yes. We have a dumpster. It's put into the dumpster and the dumpsters. A dumpster trailer. And so that dumpster trailer is dumped every three days. Let's take it off. Yep. It's taken to the landfill. It's dumped, cleaned out and brought back. So there's nothing that remains on the property and that's done every single day. So how are you going to correct the lighting is it you're going to put. I guess Mister Oham explained to us that they're shielding that could be put on the lights. If we can put shielding. If we have to turn them off and we're willing to do whatever is s necessary to, we can just switch them off. Since the LED has become such a prominent figure in any kind of commercial lighting or private lighting, we've done this on a number of different occasions. If you remember, like the moose lodge out in the forest, they had a very prominent led light that was on the side of the building. That was for the protection of their bartenders, basically. But we made them shield that. We made them readjust that. We've done that with other commercial operations as well. It's just a shield. They sew, they're read. Easily attachable. So this could be done fairly? Yes, sir. Fairly easy. Yes, sir. The lighting can be addressed immediately. There's the site plane process will take longer. We're going to discuss that with the board of county commissioners at that time. Typically in something like that, especially as busy as we are right now, it would be staff'recommendation to probably recommend about 180 days for them to enter in and complete the process. But any other adjustments on the property they can complete relatively quickly. I got a question. Yes, sir. Mister. So this has been there five years, correct? That's when you started this? Yes. Were all the permits necessary? Permits P and at that time? No. No, nothing was done. So you did this, you just built all this without any permits or anything? We asked, like the ones we bought the kennels for, if there was a permit necessary, and we were told that it was not, so we just had it custom built. But then we found out that there are permits necessary and so we're willing to get. That's what staff was saying earlier, his presentation. There were no guidelines for this five years ago. They brought it in three years ago. Staff is some of the structures they actually have on the property over to the west side. I told you where some of the puppies and things are, those are actually up to code. They are less than twelve by ten. There's no power running to those particular facilities unless it's the heating or something, and then they bring heaters down on cords, but there's no power, there's no water to those specific buildings. They are 8ft off of the sides or 25ft off the sides of the border of the property. So they're up to par. There's permitting at other locations, including the drainage retention area, that needs to be certified by an engineer. It has not been. They put a drainage area in, but unfortunately, we have to have certified calculations from an engineer in order to make sure that it's adequate for drainage at that location. There depend on how much impervious service has been added and there has been impervious service added. That's one of our biggest concerns, is to make sure that we're not allowing any flooding to reach any other properties. Now this is the low portion. You look at the contour map, that is a basin. And the back of their property and other properties is that basin. But the way they've got everything, they have it channelized from basically right behind the home and the cottage that's on the west side of the property where it does drain directly into that basin. But like I said, that has to be certified. And they just need to get out and do a site plan that has everything updated on it so everything can be permitted accurately. I guess what I'm getting at is, so this wasn't even legal in the first place, right? This was done. It's five years ago. There should have been additional permitting as far as the kennel because they do run air conditioning to that, and it is a larger building. So with that being said, there probably there needed to be permits on that. There needed to be permits for the drainage'retention area, and there has to be a signed and sealed report. It's called a major site plan when it incorporates stormater. So those are the things that we have concerns about that they need to go in back permit and have. So building department will be on site as soon as they are able to submit this, it will go through the review process just like any other commercial organization or structure. And it's not up to us, it's up to the building department if they will levy any fines to the",

        "text": " delin no comments on this this this public hearing it's the next one that I have comments on Vice chair comment councelor Imes yes um councelor Imes for the record thank you for being here tonight um my comments are based on the DPO um specifically page 98 um under way and I just noticed um throughout that section um on the site certificate that was initially um issued there was a waste management plan and um the department is recommending um condition 130 which has um some good recommendations in there for um the applicant to issue um notice of uh contracts and agreements with your um um different vendors which is good um and so I just wanted to comment on the fact that maybe um a little more information would be useful I think for uh in detail for um especially since uh we had a waste management plan with the first site certificate so um that's That's the basis of my comment and it goes back to also um subsection um B under waste minimization and that is that the applicant plans to manage the accumulation storage disposal and transportation of waste generated by the construction and operation of the facility are likely to result we would hope in minimal adverse um effects so those are my comments thank you thank you councelor Imes one more call from for any comments or questions from the council and would you like to respond to any of those questions or comments um I I don't think so at this time we appreciate the comments from um the council we'll be considering those as we head towards the the close of the public comment period uh and you again appreciate staff's work on this and your thoughtful comments tonight and look forward to continue moving this forward well again thank you for being here tonight we appreciate your presence thank you so is now 6:34 p.m. on March 21st 2024 and the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the Leaning Juniper Amendment Three is now closed the public comment period will close on March 29th 2024 at 5:00 pm thank before I get started is there anybody in the room who's planning on giving comments on that hasn't filled out a foror might be Danger all over over again are we ready the next agenda item is Ridge renewable energy facility East amendment number one draft proposed order hearing and will include an information portion provided by senior sighting anal Christoper who will provide overview of the agenda item and the amendment request and and public Hearing in which I will serve as the presiding officer Mr Clark please proceed when you're ready with the information portion of the agenda item thank you Vice chair Condon um council member Devon can you hear me okay you're the only person I can see onl yeah clearly thank you great thank you uh council members thank you members of the public that have come tonight for the record my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior sighting analist with the Department um as Vice chair Conan mentioned I will be providing a uh quick overview I promise of the citing process the approved facility and the requested Amendment and I'll briefly go over major issues discussed in the draft proposed order uh on the request for Amendment one of the wheat rdge renewable energy facility East site certificate um following my presentation Vice chair Condon will provide a overview of how the public hearing will be conducted uh before taking public comments comment will be taken in the order presented on the slide the certificate holder will be provided the opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order or to provide additional evidence or testimony on the record uh followed by an opportunity for members of the public to comment followed by an opportunity for the council to raise any issues or concerns on the record the count certificate holder will then have an additional opportunity to respond um you will hear this several times tonight but in addition to the opportunity to provide oral comments at the hearing tonight any person may provide written comments on request for Amendment 1 until 5:00 p.m. on April 4th after the close of the public written comment the department recommends the council leave the record open for the open for the certificate holder to respond to public comments until 5:00 p.m on April 8th or later if requested and slide um great uh so this process is uh this request is being processed under the type A Amendment review process uh Chase gave an overview in his presentation uh so to cover this briefly um the type A Amendment review process includes several opportunities for public review participation a public notice of the receipt of the preliminary request was provided on May 22nd 2023 uh shortly after the request submittal another public notice was issued on February 29th of this year concurrently with the issuance of the draft proposed order uh which contains the department initial recommendations to the Council on the requested Amendment including recommendations for amended site certificate conditions um as part of the typ a review we're holding tonight's hearing uh on the draft proposed order and as I said in addition to the opportunity to provide oral comment tonight written comments will be accepted until 5:00 p.m on April 4th uh following the close of the record the department will review any comments or evidence submitted on the record and will prepare responses for council's consideration at a future council meeting and after incorporating any feedback from the council staff will issue a proposed order with staff revised recommendations on the request based on comments received and evidence on the record um after the proposed order is issued the type a process allows for a possible contested case proceeding as will be explained in more detail later on only those persons who raised a relevant issue on the record of the draft proposed order either in person at this public hearing or in writing by the comment deadline May request to participate in the contested case if held a contested case proceeding would be overseen by a hearing officer appointed by the council um after the deadline for contested hearing uh contested case hearing request has passed or after the contested case proceeding has concluded the council will review the proposed order and issue its final order approving or denying the request for Amendment final orders findings of facts and conclusions of law will be based on proposed order and the outcomes of the contested case proceedings um the department will prepare and the chair will sign the final order and amended sight certificate uh if approved as approved and directed by the council uh any questions on process before I go on thank you okay um so this proceeding is on the Wheat Ridge renewable uh energy facility East uh I I did want to show that on this slide uh the components that are now included in Wheat Ridge East were originally approved to be included in larger Wheat Ridge wind energy facility uh the site certificate for that facility was issued in April 2017 and authorized construction of 500 megawatts of wind components divided into two wind turbine groups uh wheat rdge West and Wheat Ridge East that would have been connected by a 31m intra connection transmission line uh the Wheat Ridge wind energy facility was administrative administratively divided into reat Ridge 1 and two in May 2020 um the ladder Wheat Ridge 2 contained a portion of the wheat rdge West turbine group solar components added through an earlier Amendment and all of the wheat rdge East turbine group and interconnection line in November 2020 uh November 2020 we 2 was again divided into three daughter facilities uh Wheat Ridge 2 retaining the wind components in the western turbine group wheat rid three containing the solar components and Wheat Ridge East containing the Eastern turbine group and the interconnection pleas um so the site certificate for wheat wheat rdge East excuse me authorizes wheat rdge East Wind LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of nextera energy Resources LLC to construct and operate up to 66 wind turbines with Max combined maximum name plate capacity of 200 megawatts related or supporting facilities including not including but not limited to uh 20 20 megawatt battery energy storage system within a 4582 Acre Site and in illa County um the certificate holder was deemed to have began construction prior to the administrative division of wheat rdge uh wind but none of the components authorized as part of wheat rdge East have been built yet it's important to note um so the department received the preliminary request for Amendment one of the Wheat Ridge East site certificate on May 16th of last year uh we reviewed the preliminary request for completeness issued a determination that additional information was needed um on July 14th and um the certificate holder provided partial responses to the request for additional information on September 1st October 27th December 7th and December 21st we reviewed all of the ra responses and determined that the request with the responses and revisions contained uh within revised exhibits contain sufficient information to make recommendations on all applicable standards rules and laws on January 26th of this year um the certificate holder then submitted a complete RFA on January 30th uh the department issued the draft proposed order which is the subject of tonight's hearing on February 29th concurrently with the public notice uh notifying the public of the opportunity to provide comments and establishing April 4th as the demo for written public comments as uh I discussed earlier the department requested the council uh hold the record open until April 8th to provide the stri get holder with a opportunity to respond to comments um we will present a a complete review of the draft proposed order at a future council meeting likely the April meeting um the uh certificate holder has requested that the public review process be expedited to the extent possible so we're continuing to work on scheduling with them and you uh to accommodate their requests to the extent we can without impacting opportunities for public participation or the council's review um um great so uh you can see a graphic representation of uh some of the changes proposed in request for Amendment one on the slide here the approved site boundary and micro sighting B are shown in the dark blue color that kind of runs through the middle of the site there in RFA 1 the um certificate holder proposes to enlarge the site uh boundary by ex approximately 74,4 3 acres which would result in a total site area of 78,500 are as um the requested Amendment would also expand micro sighting corridors by approximately 10,058 Acres which would result in total micro sighting area",

        "text": " on a wholesale Redevelopment um with the Oregon energy security plan uh moving forward and the en Assurance plan from 2012 uh kind of put on the shelf and maybe part of the historical archives now see this is my slide here we go and finally before I turn it over to deian Henry to speak uh to some more slides I want to make note that this project involves multiple Partnerships uh our development team uh working closely with Federal Partners at the US Department of energy other state agencies particularly the Public Utility Commission as I mentioned earlier and of course uh as you'll see later in the presentation we are looking to engage with local Partners County governments City governments tribal governments as well as utilities private energy companies Community groups and the public the strategy for pulling together this plan is a little bit of um uh collecting historical documents and and current documents that are related to energy security that might already exist uh pulling them into one place as well as developing and doing new analysis collecting new information gathering new data and assessing risks and threats to Oregon's Energy Systems and ultimately coming up with recommendations for mitigation that can uh for future investment by state and local Partners uh to reduce risks to Oregon's Energy Systems and increase our security I'm now going to turn it over to my colleague Deana Henry thank you Max hi everyone I'm Dean Henry I'm the emergency preparedness manager at the Oregon Department of energy and now that you know a little bit more about the history of our energy security plan and um our strategy to develop a new one I'm going to talk about what taking uh the state Energy emergency planning efforts to the next level starting with the state and federal requirements that guide the development of the state energy security plan you heard from Max and Megan um here you go you heard from Max and Megan that um iig or the federal Bill directs the funding and gives the state direction to develop these energy security plans well during the 20122 session the Oregon legislators passed Senate Bill 1567 that also directs the agency to develop a state energy security plan that mirrors the federal requirements so Oregon's energy security plan must address All State energy sources of electricity liquid fuels and natural gas you heard Megan say this includes uh regulated and unregulated energy providers we have to provide a state energy profile that describes um organs energy demands and consumption and explains the state energy supplies from production all the way to end use we also have to assess all of the threats and hazards that could cause damage to our energy infrastructure um like natural disasters man-made events including cyber security threats and of course our plan has to propose mitigation measures to reduce risk and this includes measures that um would Harden our energy infrastructure we have to have emergency plans in place to address um Supply disruptions we also need to coordinate with our tribes to um for Energy emergency planning and response as well as our neighboring states within the region because an energy emergency in Oregon could affect the energy stability in other states but Senate Bill 1567 includes an additional fuel resilience component that the federal Bill does not include and that's to provide a safety net to our uh local communities should there be a major disaster the goal is to bridge the gap between a community uh running out of fuel while allowing the state adequate time to bring in an outside resource to resupply in an affected area and Studies have shown that a 9.0 Cascadia earthquake and tsunami would devastate our Region's Energy Systems including the liquid fuel supply and distribution system and so our ongoing planning efforts with our federal Partners show that the difficulty isn't bringing fuel into Oregon after a cascad event our greatest challenge would be moving that fuel to communities in Western Oregon due to the widespread damage to our transportation system so it could take weeks to get fuel to some communities um just due to the lack of access and um you know longer in some of the more remote areas of the state so the concept here is that if we could have small amounts of additional fuel stored in less seismically active regions of the state and then the tanks at these facilities are seismically sound then the area would have additional fuel available for emergency response purposes when needed so um the evaluation uh of this uh project will focus primarily on uh fuel storage locations that can dispense fuel um like public Works yards uh local airports motor pools and similar types such facilities and we definitely welcome your input and invite you to engage in discussions but with both state and federal requirements in mind the Oregon Department of energy um took the initial step to bring together all available Energy Information and data from state and federal studies reports and assessments into a draft Oregon energy security plan this draft brings together all of the foundational information that is critical to energy security so it identifies the authorities roles and responsibilities of key agencies and organizations that play a part in energy security and this includes agencies all around Oregon our local Partners tribal Partners as well as those roles played by our federal uh counterparts and so our plan also speaks to coordination esf2 energy coordination with our federal state local tribal and private sector Partners including our Western States within the region and the plan also um provides uh a profile of our Oregon energy landscape and summarizes the key Key Energy sector threats that we know of at this time including some mitigation measures at a high Lev and so this draft plan was a necessary step and a required step from the US Department of energy to demonstrate Oregon's progress in complying with the federal uh requirements so Oregon like all the other states submitted our Draft plans to doe for review and evaluation at the end of September and doe will provide us some feedback on what they think about our draft plan so you can get a copy of our plan off our website and you have the um URL right there on slide so while this plan is intended to be a living document a completed plan must be submitted to doe and to the Oregon legislature by September 30th 2024 with a letter from the governor certifying that Oregon's plan meets state and federal requirements so we have a lot of work to do over the course of the next year and your involvement is our next step while we have a lot of good information about Oregon's Energy Systems until now this information hasn't been collected in an intentional or um focused and a holistic way so we know that data gaps remain so to finish the plan um we want to bring together all of the information that we currently have on the threads to Oregon's electric natural gas and liquid fuel sectors to together with the information new information that we're going to be collecting from you all and uh to fill any data gaps that we identify and then uh the completed 2024 plan would have uh a comprehensive data set where we can conduct a comprehensive uh um uh I'm sorry Quant a qu Quantified risk assessment of all threats to energy sectors and then um when we're done with the risk assessment and then analysis um we would provide a suite of mitigation options that will be validated and prioritized and to do that we're going to need your help so that the completed 2024 Oregon energy security plan would have a report that discusses our engagement process with you all our data collection process results from the Quantified risk assessment as well as a recommended mitigation approach to strengthening our Energy System over over time so it is the agency's vision that the final plan will be a living resource that uh the state local government drives in collaboration with our energy providers nonprofit organizations as well as um all oregonians to better prepare to uh respond and recover from Supply disruptions as well as make more informed decisions about energy infrastructure Investments that will improve Oregon's energy security future so with that I'm going to bring up Tom Cecilia from our office and he's going to talk about your role in energy security planning thank you thanks Tiana uh to start off fix the camera um my name is Tom Cecilia I'm the Hamford hydrogeologist and fuel specialist at oo um and now that you know who oo is and something about where we're going with the energy security plan I want to dive a bit deeper into why we want your help and what we'll do with the information you give us as Deanna mentioned um we've pulled all the publicly available data and information from other agencies we could for our first draft of the plan that probably gets us 50 to 60% of the way of what we need to make the energy security plan the document we hope it will be um and we have a pretty tight timeline uh we know that the response and security begins locally we would love it if you could share your expertise and experience to fill in the remainder of this critical information while we hope the data we've collected so far is as inclusive as high level data can be we know that the few of us that who are compiling and writing the plan don't have the perspective to accurately represent the risks and activities at the regional local or individual levels we probably have a pretty good view of the big scary catastrophic Cascadia earthquake planning but we don't know how your neighborhood County or industry experiences energy and security we will give some examples of what we're looking for a little later in the talk but really anything you think of when you think of energy and security is probably worth sharing um we also know that the best people to ask what the most important risk to their energy security is are the people who live with that risk chances are those people are the ones who have studied the issues and come up with some plans maybe they've even tried to take some actions to mitigate it a couple times and have some lessons learned that could be scalable to the region or even Statewide I guess what I hope you'll take away here is that we don't want to limit the information we get by being specific about what could be helpful if you think you we should hear about something or if you are excited about something your energy or energy related then let us know so my picture of the best case scenario here is that our inbox is flooded with information whether it's a story about how your ant lost power and couldn't get gas for the generator or a County Risk mitigation plan or strategies that an agricultural industry group are trying in order to keep red Dy diesel in the equipment we'll then read through everything and um throw all the data into buckets and look for patterns then the report will describe what we found and what might be helpful since we intend this to be",

        "text": "uh hello everyone welcome to the public informational meeting on the Cascade renewable transmission system um I think it's okay we're not getting too much of an echo uh bear with us for one second um great my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior signing analyst with the Oregon Department of energy I'm just going to introduce our other Odo staff members uh really quick so you know who to ask if you have any questions or I didn't want any additional information about this meeting so I'm joined on stage here by Todd Cornett um he's the assistant director for citing at the Oregon Department of energy um Kate Sloan is in the audience Kate if you can she's another senior citing analyst and uh we have our two operations folks helping run the meeting today we have Wally Adams and Nancy hatch in the back as well as Erica UNR uh Communications person in the back um so feel free to ask any of us any questions at any time if we don't know the answer we will certainly be able to get you to somebody who does um I will have the applicant team up here in a minute and give them the opportunity to introduce themselves as well but to get started uh I'm gonna give a quick uh introduction of the project and of the sighting process itself um and then we will be going over uh sorry and then we will be going over the citing process in a little more detail uh then we will have the applicant uh give an overview of the proposed facility and the proposal in a little more detail and at the end we'll have kind of a town hall question and answer session so please do hold your comments till the end and there will be an opportunity at that time we will be asking people to queue up on this side of the stage and then we'll also be having an opportunity for folks on the phone and online to ask questions as could you change this slide next slide please all right so uh the subject of this meeting is a notice of intent to file an application for site certificate for the Cascade renewable transmission system um that uh that notice of intent was filed by uh Cascade renewable transmission LLC which is a joint venture of power Bridge LLC and sun2o partners LLC we have representatives from both of those Partners here tonight um the informational meeting is intended to give members of the public an opportunity to learn about the project and to provide comments on the noi um it's not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting is not required to pursue issues in standing for the contested case that will occur waiter in this process yep and then just again um we do have a lot to go over tonight we have quite a few people in attendance so thank you all for being here um and we do want to make sure everybody has the opportunity to participate so uh as you're giving comments later in the process just just be mindful that there are other folks that may want to speak uh next slide please okay so the project is a proposed 300 kilovolt DC transmission line uh with other related and supporting facilities that spans about 100 miles between the dials and Portland um as you'll hear in more detail the majority of the line will be buried in the Columbia River using a um a hydro jack cable burial machine or jet plow and there'll be additional segments buried in Road rights away or installed using horizontal directional drilling there's two converter station proposed near both points of interconnection uh there will be about 500 feet of overhead 500 kilovolt AC line to interconnect the Eastern converter station with the Big Eddy substation that's existing and operated by BPA just out of town here and then there'll be about three miles of 230 KV alternate current line buried underground and installed in under the Willamette River at Portland to interconnects with the harborton um finally uh oh I think we missed one um oh you can't see this too well but this is just a quick uh overview of the facility location um I just wanted to note mostly that certain portions of this line are proposed to be located in Washington state and those will be reviewed under the jurisdiction of Washington f-sec um their energy facility site evaluation um that that it also includes online segments proposed near Stevenson to avoid the Bonneville walking Dam um in addition we want to point out that uh while a lot of the maps you will see have just a single line uh that the applicant has requested some flexibility to cite the line within a siding boundary that includes much of the the river itself so um we will be showing a proposed alignment tonight but but just be aware that that is subject to change in the final application okay and with that I'm going to turn it over to time to talk about the setting all right good evening everybody thanks for taking time out of your day to uh come here either virtually or in person we appreciate it um so as Chris said you know we you know up here right now are the Oregon Department of energy so the sighting division is one portion of the Department of energy and our primary purpose is to review large-scale energy projects so the energy facility sighting program has been around since the early 70s we do a lot of different things in terms of our review and I'll talk about some of those later on um the is really made up of two major components one is the energy facility citing Council so the energy facility citing council is a governor appointed volunteer board um they're appointed by the governor confirmed by the Senate and they can serve up to two four-year terms they're the decision makers on all of our projects we do have one council member who's in attendance tonight and buyer so thank you councilmember buyer for showing up so ultimately as you'll see in the process chart which I have later on everything kind of ultimately feeds to the council and they're the decision makers we the department of energy and particularly the sighting division we staff the department of energy or the energy facility citing Council so we try to share information with the public we work with the applicant we work with the state agencies local governments tribal governments who are all part of our process but ultimately it's the council who are the decision makers our process is a pretty extensive and robust technical review so for those of you who are familiar with the sort of counties conditional use permit process ours is much bigger than that it's a much more significant review than that and we do that evaluation and like I said we ultimately make those recommended relations to the council um and one thing that I won't really speak about much here but I wanted to kind of put on kind of the record for people is we also have a fully funded compliance program so whether this project makes all the way through and gets approved we have staff who review projects once they're approved all the way from pre-construction through construction annually through operation and ultimately until this till those facilities are removed from the landscape so it's fully funded and we spend a lot of time ensuring the projects that are approved are built operated and ultimately retired consistent with our approval process next slide please so this slide shows a list of some of the facilities that fall under the jurisdiction of the energy facility citing Council so the statutory um which is up on here um it's under Oregon revised Statute 469 300 sub 11. so if you go to that statute that'll basically show you the definition of an energy facility and what that functions is is all of the projects that are within the jurisdiction of the energy facility citing Council the thresholds vary some are distance some are megawatts some are acreage but what we're specifically talking about tonight is high voltage transmission lines so the reason why this project is within the jurisdiction of the energy facility society and council is it triggers all three requirements and that is it's greater than 10 miles obviously goes from the Dallas to Portland so greater than that it is uh either 230 kilovolts or greater which this is and it's in more than two jurisdictions so those three triggers are our wides within our jurisdiction so versus a local government jurisdiction I'm not going to get into any of the other facilities but again you can kind of see what Falls within the jurisdiction of fsec on the slide next slide please so I think this slide is really important particularly at this stage um you got notices you showed up you've read some information you can see on the very far left of the color is sort of odds hopefully you can read that correctly um we're at the very beginning stage so we're at the notice of intent stage we do not have an application this is the very very beginning stage you can see on there that you know the applicant submits their notice of intent which effectively is a desktop level analysis there's not any real field work that we require at this point it's really high basically they're showing us what they want to do and where they want to do it we provide notice we seek public comment we seek making sure people understand who we are at the department of energy and who the applicant is and how the process works that's where we're at right now so at the very very beginning once we conclude the comment time frame which is June 1st what we do then is we create the project order and that's the next stage that you can see to the to the right and what that is is effectively a laundry list it's a laundry list of what the applicant has to submit in their application that is we will evaluate the notice of intent we will come up with that we will look at all the different locations that the project has proposed in what are all the issues but we also want to hear from local governments tribal governments state agencies and the public to determine what those particular requirements should be so this is why we're seeking input right now is to help us create the project order and I'll talk about that a little bit um and just to make sure people and the applicant will talk about their schedule but the notice of intent is good for two years so we often have projects we'll come in at this stage people will get this information and the project will go dark for a couple of years that is not untypical so that could happen here I don't know that it will but I just wanted to make sure people are aware so we have the documentation you know the handouts on the table in the back of the project page you can sign up to receive notices email notices so if you want to keep track of",

        "text": " is the need for additional transmission analysis so don't remember the exact phrasing of the comments we heard earlier today but the need for reliability analysis and power flow modeling to really see how the system reacts and whether there is transmission service rights i don't know if that's been mentioned yet today but you need to have transmission service rights as well which is kind of an accounting method for keeping track of where the power is being sold and allocated to which has a little bit different function to it um than like the physical limitations and where electricity actually flows but they're they're kind of related um so kind of with that in mind um i'll talk a little bit about northern they're the regional transmission planning entity for for the pacific northwest region as well as the inter-mountain region they basically perform analysis that examines interactions between all the local transmission plans of the region's transmission providers which there are are many some of them are listed here um bpa pacific or pg idaho power puget sound vista some of those have a lot more transmission mileage and bigger systems than others i think sean mentioned pge's transmission system you know is maybe not small but it's certainly not as large as bonnevilles or pacific cores in addition the location of where these transmission systems exist um has has some you know key overlap with with the floating offshore wind topic um bpa and pacificorp have a lot of coastal transmission and transmission in southern oregon and so those are going to be some key entities that were already raised you know for their importance and significance on continuing the conversation on floating offshore wind this trip the local transmission plans i alluded to those those are done by every transmission provider and they identify transmission upgrade and expansion needs necessary to meet transmission service requests they've received they've received from power power projects um or another way they kind of embedded that with that or the interconnect that people looking for interconnections into the bulk transmission system and so the term interconnection cues uh maybe some have heard of the herd of those um but there's like long lists of people waiting their turn in line um kind of like imagine it like going to the bakery and getting your bakery ticket um and then when it's your turn you have the option of picking you know something from the bakery and you may not want it depending on how expensive that item might be um and so there's studies that kind of do some analysis of what the upgrades might be to interconnect certain sizes of generator projects um and all this kind of stuff works together so that that kind of gets to a little bit to mike's question um i think if i'm tracking the right mic in the right question in the chat um but i think there were some questions about cost allocation maybe which i can say a few more words about but i kind of get in the deep end of the pool pretty quickly on this topic um and so if sean or um anyone from bonneville or pacific court is on the line um maybe after after we roll through this um these next maybe four or five slides or maybe i'll just go through everything and we wait until the the time slot for additional if we want to talk talk about more specifics but um the the purpose of this slide here is to kind of you know it's helpful for that background um and and i can say a little bit more about the background but the real purpose here was to highlight that their transmission planning cycle this regional transmission planning cycle is just getting started for the 2022-2023 cycle and so i have a couple or i think i have one slide that sums up an important piece of that that relates to offshore but before that let me let me say a little bit more about regional planning the purpose of this regional transmission planning is to facilitate compliance with uh four quarter 1000 requirements and so the federal does have some jurisdiction when it comes to transmission system planning um and cost allocation for that matter i don't i don't necessarily know if approving um is the right word um but but but maybe um so regional transmission planning um assesses the reliability impacts efficiency and cost effectiveness of various combinations and interactions of the identified transmission projects you know from from those local transmission plans for each transmission provider the northern grid entity this planning region each region has planning entities northern grid is ours and they promote collaboration across these individual transmission providers to coordinate on essentially a regional transmission plan that is reliable efficient cost effective and accounts for public policy goals so they'll various combinations and interactions of identified projects and then they also provide a form for cost allocation and a method for cost allocation for these new transmission so that's kind of probably enough just to what people's appetite for more try for more information but it gets complicated pretty quickly um so circling back to um this planning cycle um in addition to the transmission providers that are part of the northern grid entity there's also a state representation that's part of northern grid and so state government reps from the states that are covered by the northern grid footprint are are involved with with kind of these processes and and one of the avenues and opportunities that states can get involved with is by putting forward transmission projects that they that they would like to see studied oregon washington idaho montana wyoming utah nevada each have state reps for oregon we have state representation from the oregon public utility commission and also ourselves oregon department of energy and so we submitted a transmission study request um just the other day there was a march 31st deadline um and i'll i'll get to that specifics um so here's another map that's helpful kind of likes maps they're nice to look at and they can kind of say a thousand thousand words pretty quickly um you can kind of see here you know i was talking about the different transmission planning entities um this gives a good snapshot of a lot of the big transmission players in the um and so here's here's some details pretty high level of our transmission static study request which was itself pretty high level and so we submitted this just recently and it's being considered by northern grid along with um i think several other study requests i'm not i haven't seen the other study requests so i'm not too sure what those entail but probably the bottom line is that it's still to be determined if our requests for this study will be accepted and actually studied um but what we were thinking was um kind of relation in relation to those comments about the winston and fairview substations are you know what what are the substations going to be i guess we don't really know we don't really know if these areas are going to be leased or how these project economics pencil out who would be paying for the transmission likely the developer um but there's probably some nuance there and and the scenarios are are another question you know how much and so just to try to understand get a little bit more data you know do some reliability analysis and further further this body of work we thought it'd be interesting to put forward some scenarios that kind of bookend the two to three gigawatts we've talked about from the other studies in the the one and a half is kind of easy to understand it's six plus nine um the 600 plus the 900 fairview and once and we thought that would just be a starting point to check to check what the system can handle when you account for power flow dynamics and transmission service rights and then then we just kind of thought well let's put some other numbers down and see what happens um with impacts to the system with with larger scales so that's kind of really high level what we submitted wish i had more information for you at this point but it's kind of all tbd but i thought it was good information for this audience and then another transmission another in process transmission analysis that can build this transmission body work is some efforts by california that oregon department of energy is partnering partnering on the department of defense and they have an office of local defense and community cooperation one of my favorite acronyms that i like to say old cc but the old ccc um and they've been um involved with department of energy and and we're working with them kind of on a continuous basis to promote early coordination on energy projects of any and scale but kind of wind turbines and towers are a concern with their height and how they could impact radar and flight flight paths and things we've already heard about today so and what what happened here was um you know old dc is also concerned about energy projects in california just as much as they are here and up in washington you know their reach is pretty pretty far and um domestic security is a pretty important issue and their training is critical so um they've they've worked with odo on the orisa project oregon renewable energy siding assessment for example and so getting down to california they're interested in how offshore wind could impact stuff down in california and since northern california is so close to southern oregon um we we jumped in and are part of this as well and so you know kind of summarized it here on the slide at a high level but they're going to do some detailed technical analysis with some grant money from old cc on transmission infrastructure limitations and opportunities maps of the existing infrastructure current capacities provide some technical data and assistance to further assess the potential potential impacts of offshore wind um that's probably you know at a high level what's going on um they're they're still working through some really preliminary um contracting um down in california you know relating to the consultants that could hire to do this work so i don't really have too much more to share on this yet either engaging with public outreach with oregon stakeholders is one of the the big reasons we wanted to get involved as well so stay tuned i think is is probably the big takeaway for that i just wanna know yeah there was a couple hands up i saw sean's hand earlier but joshua's hands up right now so i wanted to um go to joshua to see what his question or comment was and invite sean if you wanted to put your hand back up if you wanted to make a comment or question you can do that too go ahead joshua all right okay thanks joshua fan with climate solutions um it seems like you know kind of at a high level sort of in the broad scope of things there's a lot of questions outstanding questions about transmission availability i'm you know i'm a policy",

        "text": " I don't have the numbers. We are earning every year in particular with the small trees that take longer to grow But we can get more information for you to give to you George and we can give it to you next week we have some questions Yes yes I have questions and I'm going to leave my week of my question of the trees for the other week I'm very very excited and I'm delighted to hear information about the Oregon micromaya does anyone have information about it I think we have some staff and Alan is reaching out to answer Yes good evening I'm Alien I'm the city engineer for this project for those of you who don't know is a gold energy department partnered with pg and is going to fund battery storage at Oxford Street and 22nd to store batteries and that is going to power a feeder for a building and that work is going to start at the end of this excuse me but I can't breathe that it's coming so fast talk we talk to us we are going to bring it to the city manager to sign and the work is going to be carried out with the design and construction this year and next year And Alan the odeoe sorry the Oregon department of energy This is a very exciting program and it is very very good news I don't know if you have any other questions in this regard member Philips And that is a question to point out and see a comment For at the beginning of this meeting we had a preamble pointing out the big things and one of them is the adoption of the operational commission if we saw is to add to given this in this section what we have in terms of the Parents can help us with this reviewed in the previous section those are not here in terms of the power range and we all Sorry you can't hear four members of sos and we had two and we have eight positions in the last area I think I was late but I want to point out that it is really very important to add things like kiss seeing adding two essential things like our rangers because we have an expansion and we only have one if that is correct and we have 92 parks we need more forest rangers Yes then I think the time has come to expand the number of rangers and they really have those that are very tall and very excited and so I'm seeing in terms of this growing community Yes thank you very much counselor each of these positions that were included in has a direct relationship with the safety of our community and those are part of and we want to improve that function and the community and to keep this usable thank you very much we want to make sure that we hear well that any new position will be recommended only and that vacancy will be filled And if phase one of the income options and implemented And if this is correct then all Those new ones for all of that are going to be based on phase two of those income, yes, and on our personnel discussion, while these are very important positions, we do not want to put ourselves in a position where we do not have the income to sustain them, we want to put this operating commission in this year's budget and we want to demonstrate to the community and the council and the budget committee the purposes for which we are going to use it but on the other hand fail by not having enough income to support the operations that are already functioning so stay and we are going to continue giving you more information I do n't know if there are more questions yes I really my question that I have is that if we fulfill these positions that they are asking for then some of these positions bring with them additional income on the way in the future That would support those positions well directly not really not some of the support positions in those operations can have a compensation and the allocation plan of other funds because other funds are taken care of and no not directly indirectly we can say that the rangers can reserve so that the parks to receive income for thank you and I don't know if this answered the question and I think you are thinking Yes, but I'm fine and if you have to come back, then come back to us Yes, thank you Mr. President in that section During this year and last year the budget of thousand dollars to the climate action plan and My question that one came out But what is the budget for climate action this was identified in the budget and once this action plan is finalized and completed I want to know what is the transition of the sections climatic conditions as well as seen instead of just the planning because the prevention plant has been budgeted for several years the first is the reference of 200,000 and the 950,000 is the same amount in dollars that was seen for the implementation services also for the action plan and we also see that these we know that there are going to be more costs as there is more implementation of the plans that is why both things are included the budget for next year thank you very much I think I have been trying to see how many new ftps and find the full-time employees and for the counselor Philips and I want to talk about the in terms of the coast guard uh forest guard and I see that with good eyes that there are more but if we look at page 176 we are showing the four new compliances with the codes of the fiscal year and five point four to ten point four five So these are the four This is the code But as explained in the text two of them are going to function as the rangers and in the other part we also see under those rangers we have two more that were added from one point one six to one So my question would be I have a question that I asked and what I see is that for these rangers two classified as also people who support security and two of them are as rangers so There are six new uh full- time people two work as rangers two work as security people and others are classified rangers so I think it's good But somehow I want to check if I'm reading page 176 because the staff is saying there are four and I see That 's six for me. There are six, two rangers and two security people and two more. Well, there are several things that are happening because good consolidation of the compliance programs and with it all these compliances in the fiscal year in this column were mixed within a only program and we also have a staff assignment each year here and this fluctuates depending on which members are assigned to the program But as for new full-time people we have two compliance officers and two new rangers who are also classified as compliance officers but the compliance program is not shown, yes, I answered, yes, the member is clear. I need you to turn on your microphone. Well, I am going to follow up with you, but I did want to understand if we are talking about four or six full-time people, or for me it was not Of course, if there were four or I'll talk to you later, don't worry, it sounds great. Let's follow up. There are also four in total. We can do more research on which personnel is assigned to the compliance program and I think that many times when we are changing from place to place it can get very confusing so Thank you for taking the extra time to explain to us any other questions members today thank you Madam President and I think for me it is difficult priorities and many of you I am always struggling with priorities I know where There are mine and sometimes it is difficult to see the parks when we are seeing daily problems that have to do with, for example, homeless people, drug addiction and mental illness, but I am also the owner of a restaurant that survived the pandemic and I had to learn to think out of the box every time I turned around so when I see this I'm thinking about my business and my home and I create and I think creatively and I heard that you guys drove and said there 's nothing here that's not useful So I I also heard it and I also heard the public testimony that says that somehow it makes sense with what I was thinking and it has to do with the apa or the aip and it really made me think it's something I didn't know about So when I hear things new and I don't know anything about it I want to know more so I hope what I'm saying makes sense and thanks for the opportunity to share Thank you very much Joshua I would like to talk about it Yes I can follow up but I know how this works for me it sounds like there is a doesn't add up or there's something going on And I also know that our family had to put that aside a long time ago through employment and My question is where are we at This is what it's about And that's called the individual accounting program that it really gives benefits separately the city takes it six percent and is often referred to as if we see that finance people I know they are not finance people but it is called like a peak how to collect it really depends on where we are who pays and in where things are paid at the moment I think we chose it because of salary increases several years ago and that's why we pay it. It's cheaper for us to pay that six percent than to increase a salary by six percent. Well that makes me think more. I will be able to give you more information if you require it, member Milton Yes, the question I asked before, plate fifteen and eight go hand in hand, true, And why are you seeing them and the reason for My question is because it has sustainable growth and we are seeing one as a branch of the library and also an amphitheater program that we rent in we wanted to have a library people come into the community in the west part of Salem so in all these positions The question is if there is any study that has been carried out where we asked for an increase of three point five in budget and there is something that would show that if we are doing this that if this is going to be sustainable for the future and with the amphitheater etc. then that is a very very very good question. small tangent in",

benefit for all of you so I more than welcome or more than interested in answering any questions you may have thank you questions Dr hstr first of all I'd like to thank you uh very much for your presentation I just one comment I was I was flipping through here and I'm glad to hear that everything went very well because when I was first flipping through I I your organizational tactics you you've got them in red the first thing I was thinking it's like oh my gosh we're not what what's going on here so but I read it and like oh no we're actually on track so maybe in the future think about green or blue or something are you talking about those yeah you know what's interesting online it's more of a coraly color and it prints red right yeah but noted thank you so thank you so I hopped on trans Das looks like via is beating us out on customer satisfaction did they gloat or provide any insights that we might be able to glean from not during uh the national results presentation but I will say we are waiting for results from our most recent so they just had hot off the press their surveys come through and we're still waiting for our information so we'll see how it plays out after uh hours comes but they they actually didn't uh speak to it okay but I did very professional but we're still top two yeah Director D since director Carney isn't here to do this this is amazing and I just want to take a second to really compliment how much work goes into this I know all of the time and the reports you bring us are so complete and well thought out and very easy for us to interpret I very much appreciate that and I just don't want that to go unsaid like how much work I know goes into this like I've worked lots of different places but the I know that we worked with an outside organization to make sure it was this organized but to see us still very on track and very following and like looking forward to continuing this process in the future so we can continue to have measurable outcomes that the community can observe and engage with is just amazing and I just needed to applaud out loud so thank you and it's definitely a team effort I mean a lot like you said a lot of work goes into it as a team so thank you yeah I've heard about some uh very interesting uh and exciting internal Excel dashboards to track the the status of the Strategic plan yes okay well if there's no other questions um I do want to thank you and also I appreciate how you can make very technical data actually in in thring like I just I feel like the entire board was like this all time so well I get very excited about it so thank you thank you all right that's going to bring us to our service change briefing great and I'll ask service planning manager Chris French to please come uh good evening president and host Pressley members of the board I'm here to uh give the January uh Service uh briefing uh the service change will take place on January 7th um and will go through Saturday May 4th uh this is a fairly minor uh change uh some of the things that we were hoping we will would be able to do uh I'll talk about those later but um things that are happening uh the rout Lancaster verta we in the last service change we made some adjustments to the schedules to um to help with the battery charging and in that uh swap there was some time points and routes that got close on one trip and so we made some adjustments there to help with that uh holiday Service uh for MLK on January 15th will be running Saturday service on the local uh buses and then on President's Day February 19th we'll be operating Sunday Service uh in the regional service uh we've been running for the 1X Wilsonville Express uh a few months ago we've been running on detour because we um pulled out of the Market Street Parking ride due to issues there and so we've we're now making those changes permanent um with the two morning trips uh picking up at market and Savage instead of going inside the park and ride a lot the afternoon trips uh had done that uh for years that we didn't enter in in the afternoon so we're just making all TR trips match uh smart is also uh doing the same uh Regional holiday Service uh there is no holiday for the regional service we don't operate uh and lift service uh we match all loc all the local fixed route uh service times so lift will mirror the local fixed drout system for the holidays and for all days um as I said that last time I gave the service briefing I thought that we were going to be able to launch the Route 22 uh in January um delays with getting the buses on property uh made it so that we had to push uh that out the vehicles are now on property but we couldn't uh make that decision to move forward with it and then if they didn't come pullback so uh the vehicles are in place we're working on outfitting them with all of the equipment that's needed to operate on the fixed route and so in May uh the Route 22 will launch so with that that concludes my uh briefing and I'd be happy to answer any questions any Davidson could you give us a preview of other service changes that may be priola that may show up in May I'm not going to hold you to it but wow um I don't nothing May uh the launch of the battery electric buses will happen in May so that's uh is we're on target for the uh that Corridor going live so that's probably the other major thing that I can think of right off other than that um I'm nothing's coming to mind for for the the change in from the fossil fuel powered buses to battery electric buses with the testing that's going on is that going to change the timbles at all I don't imagine but we so with all of the work that we've done to this point we believe uh we made adjustments to our blocks and looking at it so until we have the Chariots experience we won't really know but we believe uh that we should be F that we shouldn't need to make changes es um immediately so um we will monitor it after the buses are out there running and with the testing we may uh realize some things that we might want to change but probably it's highly unlikely at this time okay thank you any other questions no okay thank you very much y all right moving on to the fy2 24 q1 performance report and I'll ask Chief Planning and Development officer shopi UL aom please to come forward all right all right good evening and thank you president pry um so it's going to be a long report I'll try to be uh precise and succinct as much as possible so this is going to be our fiscal year 24 FY 24 q1 report service period from July through September 30 July 1 to September 30 2023 and uh in this report we try to include our uh fix routes and all the services that we provide all the kpis that we have as of now and also we have included some other uh maintenance and operational kpis uh the information that we have available as of now so before we go into the details uh let me share the purpose and the goals and objectives of exercises uh we try to we're trying to understand the system performance overall fix route and all the other services that we provide and uh and this data will uh be used to develop a cost effective Mobility option and connect the communities um better so with that being said uh this is going to be a work in progress document so in the upcoming uh months I'm going to present it's going to be keep adding new information as available so let's go into the report next is that working okay it worked all right so this is the uh the key1 review so those are the key uh activities that happen in this uh last three month in the in the first 3 months uh we have started the uh yo contactless uh Fair payment system beta version which is testing for month of July and then we also had our first bus radio since covid uh and it was a great success um and after a successful beta testing in uh from August 1st we started our uh official launch of UMO contact us Fair payment system and uh also at the same time from August 1st uh we started the new Fair structure unifying the local and Regional that helps a lot with the fair cing benefits into it and uh at the same time in August we have started the ktc Kaiser Transit Center uh construction for charging and in September we had uh our September service change we have implemented that one um so next this is uh our system wide performance support so those are the kpis that we have available as of now um and by service level so we have included the fix route local and Regional and Par Transit service that we provide um dial right and um vpol services so this is a synopsis of the whole system overall so and as you see that uh our local service still is the backbone of the whole system which includes includes about uh 92% of the total wrers ship um we have seen uh about 21.5% increase of the ridership compared to the same time period last year which is a positive",

        "text": " Florida counties. What is somewhat moderating that, it's also older county, so it ranks about 45th in student generation rate. So that kind of moderates the need a little bit. But at the same time, the taxable value per capita in terms of ranking is about 44. So that's among the bottom one third of the counties. So that kind of. And that's one of the main revenue sources for school district. So that creates challenges. As far as the background, the school district had concerns about the recent growth levels, were considering adopting the impact fee again, but at the same time they wanted to understand what the future needs are. So they went really sort of above and beyond the regular impact we study and tasked us with preparing this long range plan. And it's really that this plan is meant as a tool. It's really looking at the conditions that we can see today with the best available data. But then school district would review that every so often and adjust according to trends. So when we start with demographics, this chart is showing population growth trends going back to 1980s. The green line is Marion county and Yellow is Florida. And you can see 1980 to 2000, the growth rate was significantly higher. That kind of continued through the economic boom of 2005. During the recession, the county lagged behind the state average, but then again started to increase at or above state average since then. And you can see future projections, both beaver medium and high going forward. One other important thing about this, when all this growth was happening in the eighties, nineties, seventies, school districts built a lot of schools. And those schools now are in there like 30 years old, 40 years old, and more. So that creates a need on the maintenance side that adds to the financial concerns. And we are seeing that with many school districts. This is showing the permitting trends. And again you can see during the economic booms of 2005, six, seven, the permitting, residential permitting reached 7500 units or so. And now you are sort of getting closer to that level. And this chart is now showing 22, which is higher than even 21. So it was about 6500 units. So there's a lot of activity going on. We used this information in two different ways. We looked at past five years and average units were about 3500 per year. We also were hearing concerns about at the time, maybe there'll be a recession coming, what would happen? We looked at the entire 30 year period and that was averaging about 2800. So we prepared scenarios under both assumptions. Again, this is chart showing housing unit projections from different sources. We have University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business research, medium level and high level. So they range from 2300 units per year to about 4600. In between is about 3500. Again, residential permitting over the past 30 years, averaged 2800. Just past five years is 3500. And then we also looked at the long range plan, transportation plan estimates, and they are quite a bit lower, 1600. So given all this information, our primary scenario uses 3500. We think it's very reasonable, but we again, just to be on the, to test it, we also use that 2800 as an option per year. So excuse me, Commissioner Stone, could you please confirm to us, did that include all the municipalities as well as Marion county permitting? Yes, ma'am. Okay, thank you. We then look at where this development is likely to occur. So when you look at the county, the eastern side is all environmental land. And then the county established the farmland preservation area in 2005 in the northwest section. So then basically that's pushing all the development primarily to the southern portion of the county. So when we look at the square miles, out of 1600 square miles, really 760, about half of it is where most of the development is likely to occur in the future. This chart is showing sort of progression of single home construction. Like the very top left chart is homes built before 1950s. And then it goes every decade, and you can kind of see all the way to seventies. Most of the construction were in the sort of a middle corridor of the county, and then it starts spreading everywhere. And after you pass the farmland preservation area, after 2010, it started being pushed down to the southern portion. So it's kind of showing that trend. And then finally we look at availability of vacant land because that could be a restricting element. But again, Marion county has quite a bit vacant land already zoned as residential. So that will not be an element that restricts future development. And then we try to understand where, again confirming where the projected developments are likely to occur again. So this chart is showing what the long range transportation plan projects. So those are the purple boxes, and the darker the purple, more density is indicated. And then the yellow circles are. Residential developments are likely to come along over the next five years. The green squares are about six to ten years. And then the diamonds, the blue diamonds are over ten years. So when we look at it, you can kind of see both the long range plan and the more near upcoming development is concentrated around sort of a southern section in that right below ocala. So once we sort of determine the growth levels and approximately where that growth is going to occur, then we want to understand what level of students these new homes are going to generate. To do that, we look at the student generation rate, and we start with the median age. Again, an older community has fewer students. And this chart is showing the median age trends over time, going back to eighties. And Marion county consistently has been older than the state average. The city itself is younger, but the county is older. This is showing the age groups. And green bars are Marion County. Orange bars are Florida. And you can see green bars are outweighing the yellow ones or orange ones in the older age groups again. And then this is showing the age distribution percentages. So the school age kids in the county are about 16% of the population, which is pretty close to Florida average, 17%, and then it's higher in the city. So then in terms of when taking all this demographic data and converting to school needs, we basically again take the population data, estimate the housing units, and then look at what level of students these units are likely to generate. Student generation rates are calculated based on taking the student addresses and matching them with the property appraiser database to see what type of housing unit they are coming from. And we look at them by school level, age of home, and on a countywide basis. So this chart is showing this analysis for all homes in the county. And you can see we started with several categories and then decided that we really didn't have a big enough sample for townhouses or condos. They are pretty small. Like, there's only 2% of the units in the county are townhouses and 1% is condos. So we combine all the single family detach, attach, and then condos and apartments. And this is measuring all homes. So it's basically saying every four to five homes generate one student. 0.2250.26, right around there. We now want to understand what the newer homes are doing for planning purposes. We are more interested in what new homes are generating. And we have in that case, too, we have a pretty good sample on the single family detach but townhouses, there were only 20 built since 2017 and only 20 condos. So we really don't have very good data. So we use this information primarily to adjust single family detached slightly down. So we end up using 0.221 in our estimates for single family townhouse and 0.258 for condos and apartments. The other factor we look at is the charter school enrollment. In some counties, charter schools are handling maybe 19 20% of the enrollments, and so they are able to help with the upcoming pressure. But here in Marion county, they add up about to 2% of total enrollment. So it's pretty insignificant right now. So there's not much relief from charter schools to accommodate future growth. And this chart is showing the enrollment trends of traditional schools. And you can see going back to 2009, and you can see that current enrollment is the highest since then. And this is showing the fluctuations in enrollment, students added per year. You see the big dip during the pandemic, which is what most school districts experience, and then the district recover from that and continue to increase enrollment at a high level. So when we did the final estimates, we have some assumptions. We use fish capacity. That's used, established by the Department of Education, and it's used by all school districts. We had the prototype sizes. We utilized long range transportation, plant distribution to distribute the population by attendance boundary of each school. And again, we could calculate it two different scenarios, 2800 units and 3500. Within each one, we have a low projection and high projection, and low projection looks at a county wide estimates. When we need one full school on a countywide basis, how many schools we would need. High projection looks at the sub areas and tries to balance the use of portables in a more aggressive way. And it basically looks at if we need about half a school in those areas, it triggers construction of a school. So with the 3500 units we need, altogether seven to ten schools, we are",

        "text": " to achieve carbon policy objectives in place across the west and they found 350 gigawatts of new renewable generation now this is on a nameplate basis um but 350 gigawatts of nameplate renewables over the next 20 years it's sort of hard to uh really uh grasp how big that is but it's uh it's enormous it's about 10 times the size of the entire existing northwest hydropower system in terms of installed capacity and the modeling shows that's needed in the next 20 years and then here's the just the northwest not from the northwest power council but this is from a consultant study that looked at economy-wide decarbonization so this would be going even further than hp 2021 but this is an expectation of many of sort of where things are going to have to head in terms of renewable development to really achieve deep decarbonization of the economy and their their study found 80 gigawatts of new wind and solar just in the northwest so these are these are big numbers of we have about 10 or 11 000 megawatts nameplate of wind and solar in the northwest today um and so this is saying another 80 gigawatts on top of that of course it's all happening as coal retirements are occurring and partly because coal retirements are happening right as we decarbonize the system but it won't change the operational characteristics and that's going to be a right so 4 000 megawatts of additional coal retirements expected in the northwest which is uh just a small portion of the 21 000 megawatts expected across the entire west so let's look at uh go back to that consultant study what is that resource mix expected to look like then in 2050 lots of new wind and solar generation of uh not surprising but i will note that they uh they assume in orange and blue here uh stable output from our nuclear plant the columbia generating station and from the hydro projects um so this is all on top of that you see the blue dark blue disappears coal retires you still have a little bit of that light blue natural gas and then so not only are you getting a lot more wind in solar but also note that uh look how much bigger that right bar is than the left one right the expectation is that a lot of fossil fuel end uses such as transportation fuels will need to electrify for us to meet our carbon so a much larger electric sector and a much more low carbon one at the same uh but i also want to point out though just that little red sliver at the top of the right hand bar uh storage uh you know i started my presentation talking about that being sort of a thing missing in the power sector um i'd suggest this is a presentation this is analysis rather from 2019 our industry is changing quite rapidly i don't know if many battery projects have kind of landed on your radar to date but i would suggest they probably will this is uh some numbers from kaiso down in california against the grid operator in california they do a transmission plan every year and in 2020 2021 their transmission plan showed 1300 megawatts of battery storage one year later this just came out in november this is their draft analysis uh for the next plan uh a seven x year-over-year increase in batteries in california so a 700 annualized growth rate uh which sounds pretty good to me um you know uh i wouldn't mind that but uh it's uh it's hard to it's hard to you know talk about a hockey stick this is uh you know i i doubt this rate of growth will continue for very long but it's just uh gives you some taste of uh just really how quickly this is coming at us and it's it's going to come north sooner than later uh off the wind is i think also uh something that's of increasing interest as i mentioned earlier it's that really higher wind capacity factor compared to what we see onshore and it also has a kind of winter output profile so i we'll be seeing and hearing more about this i know there are some interesting jurisdictional issues there this is all going to be out in federal waters and everything but certainly will impact the onshore transmission system so i'd say keep that on your radar and with that i wanted to get to some concluding thoughts and turn it over to thanks adam we'll start by looking at uh data from the past a few years here in oregon this is a diagram of the energy flow in organ a visual summary of how energy is produced imported and consumed and it shows that oregon utilizes a diverse collection of resources for energy um we we call the sankey in-house as the type of chart that it is and you read it from left to right as energy flows through the system this version was published um in the 2020 energy report um it's based on 2018 data an updated chart will be included in the 2022 energy report that's due to be published at the end of the year um the numbers represented here are trillions of btus of energy and we use a british thermal unit a measurement of the heat content of fuels or energy be able to compare and count energy sources or fields that are of varying types so this chart follows each resource through the energy flow from left to right resources are produced in states or they're imported and from their flow to either electricity generation or directly to the sectors for consumption you can see that oregon primarily produces renewables in in-state and imports nearly all of the fossil fuel-based resources that oregon consumes natural gas coal and other petroleum products are used in transportation sector direct use in industry and homes and to generate electricity in the top right you can see that oregon primarily exports renewable down the center you can see that waste energy is a significant portion of the energy system this value includes all energy that's not harnessed from the point of extraction to the point of use it includes energy lost as heat during or transformation into electricity transmission losses and many other factors and also includes potential energy efficiency savings that are out there waiting to be uh in the bottom right we have use energy which is the electricity used to serve a purpose such as light bulbs in your home or the heat you feel from your furnace vents comparing imports to exports we can see that in total oregon imports significantly more energy than we export next slide please add the chart on the left shows utility scale generation facilities in the western region of the united states it's worth noting on this chart that the smallest icons have been sized up for visibility so while it might appear from here that solar has taken over the region color generation in yellow while growing still remains one of the smaller contributors to the regional generation along the west coast we have hydro in solar and yellow and wind and orange which are significant contributors supplemented by the natural gas shown in and moving east you can see that we have significantly more coal-based plants in the center of the united on the right i'm showing oregon's primary energy production from 2018 um so this chart does not include generation from imported resources this is just what we harness and produce from oregon's oregon's primary energy product is although the biomass produced in state is used for both electricity generation and for direct use as heat or for processes in the commercial and industrial sectors the largest resource in oregon is hydro followed by biomass then wind and solar and geothermal there's only one site for natural gas production in oregon and it generally does not produce natural gas next slide please the chart on the left shows the 2019 electricity consumption data by resource for the whole state now we can see that oregonians use a mix of locally produced and imported energy with hydropower leading at 37 percent followed by coal at 27 and natural gas at almost 25 wind and nuclear power significant portions of the mix and remaining resources including solar are a smaller on the right we can see how this same data has changed over time from 2012 to as adam shared with us hydra remains relatively constant and serves as the backbone of the organ mix whole use is declining over this period while natural gas and solar are other resources like wind and nuclear tend to be fairly consistent from a consumption see that the total electricity consumption is rising over this period of time driven both by population increase electrification and other economic next slide please so we can directly compare oregon's electricity generation and consumption to get at electricity imports and so this data is from 2018 which is before the boardman coal plant closed and it shows that oregon generates excess hydro natural gas wind solar and geothermal electricity while it imports almost all the coal electricity and all the nuclear electricity we consume while we export natural gas electricity in-state natural gas generation is supplied by imported natural gas fuels all right next slide please so to wrap it all up the primary takeaways we have for you are that variability across hours days seasons and years is a major driver in the electric electricity sector both in terms of renewable generation and output and in terms of consumption patterns electricity exports from oregon are mostly driven by surplus hydropower output in the spring months during wet and then major differences exist across the energy sector while much of oregon's electricity consumption comes from in-state generation nearly 100 of its fossil fuel use both from the transportation sector and electricity generation is imported all right do we have any other questions yes cindy yes thank you thank you for the presentation to both of you can you go back to the um medusa looking graph with you i like that we should call it medusa there you go um i and i want to make sure that i'm reading it properly the waste energy so on the left hand side it's energy produced or imported and if we follow those lines through so there are 736 btus wasted is that am i reading that right yes so that includes everything from the the point of production all the way through so if you think about kind of every step on this chart there's there's losses along the way that results in that waste energy and a lot of it is heat so we think about like a natural gas generator they they actually spend a lot of energy working on how to cool down their system in order",

        "text": " which is the TR time Horizon of executive order 204 and that will really serve to inform near-term actions needed to meet our decarbonization goals and to identify gaps and opportunities so the technical analysis is structured to help answer questions that can inform policy Direction and these questions can be driven by policy choices we might want to test what a certain policy can accomplish or they can anticipate potential risks or opportunities so here are a few examples of the types of questions that we might ask but they're not the questions we're going to ask I want to emphasize here that this is one of the things that we would like to Define through engagement with you and why we'll talk quite a bit about engagement in a little bit uh we want to work with you to identify the Strategic questions that we should be asking in the energy strategy so here are just a few examples what if developing new clean energy resources is delayed what if consumer adoption of Technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles occurs more slowly than expected what if transmission expansion to access resources outside of Oregon is harder than expected or what if hydrogen pipelines and other clean Fuel Delivery Systems cannot be constructed between Oregon and other states by the time that um we anticipate they might be constructed so how are these scenarios developed I'm going to dive into a little bit of the how the I started with the what this is a bit of the how um first uh we start with a model of Oregon's economy this is similar to what you saw in some of the early di um earlier diagram so we start with dividing up the state by residential commercial industrial and transportation sectors and the energy demand in those sectors today and then make assumptions about what that demand might be over time that helps then if we go to the middle box identify Oregon's energy needs so the needs are kind of uh responsive to the demands on the system so how much electricity do we need to meet the requirements of all these sectors how much do we need in transportation fuels how much do we need in direct use fuels and finally the model helps us understand how we can meet these energy needs most efficiently maintaining reliability meeting our policy objectives and considering cost so just to give an example um we'll Define we might Define how much electricity we need but then the next step is to understand how we generate that electricity and how we get it to homes businesses okay diving a little bit deeper into the into the guts here so what goes into a scenario uh again the scenarios are kind of the places where we test out these strategic questions so each scenario tries to help answer a question or series of questions and we do that by changing something in the model that can be done by doing more or less of something so here you have an example of heat pump adoption we might see more or less adoption of heat pumps and that will have an effect on how we decarbonize um heating whether with electric heat pumps or with something else and how much how much um what what our needs are to meet the um our decarbonization objectives and heating demand we can also learn by completely turning something on or off for example the model can allow new transmission to be built or it cannot to reflect barriers to transmission development and that can help reveal the role of transmission and what happens if it is or is not um available and of course you can you can also have levers on more or less transmission as well so it's um these are just illustrations of the tools that we have uh so again these are not necessarily examples of what we will test we will will be looking to the engagement process to help us decide that um and the scenarios will help us test uncertainties and see the impacts of policies of actions of uh customer Behavior like in the case of heat pump adoption on energy needs and on how energy is supplied so to deepen your feel on how the model is structured um sorry I'm actually going to go up one um over here so we're here in the left hand box so we're looking at um the first step right so we have our residential commercial industrial and transportation demands and then we're going to look at um the demand kind of by Appliance so in the residential sector um we'll look at air conditioning space heating water heating and we'll look at how much we have today what the energy demand is and make assumptions about how much energy we'll need in the future and how much how many of these appliances will be in place and what their characteristics will be and we'll do the same for um end uses in the commercial sector in the industrial sector and in transportation and uh in total there are about 70 sub sectors and by sub sectors I mean these bullet points here that the model will um look at and Define so it's pretty detailed stuff so now I'm going from the micro to the macro level so um Oregon as you saw operates as part of a larger Energy System um and so it's important when we're looking at the Oregon energy strategy to understand the um other kind of forces that impact uh costs in Oregon resource availability and things like that so um here are a few points of how we're going to approach that um the model will include competition for fuels including biomass Renewables and hydrogen derived from Renewables um and that's to reflect that there's not an infinite amount of these resources there's some competition out there and that is something that's important to take into account um we also uh are aware that Oregon is part of an interconnected electricity system over pretty large and diverse region so we're going to take that interconnectedness into account and also capture transmission line and pipeline flow and build constraints not just in Oregon but in the region um and it's also important and really interesting to think about how the variety of resources across this whole region the variety of different kinds of Demands and time zones contribute can actually contribute to helping us meet our um our goals because of kind of complimentary resources the sun may not be shining here it might be shining elsewhere same with where the wind is blowing and the bigger the system the more resources we have to draw on there will be areas that don't plug into the model directly um we can't quantify everything um but but these things are an important part of the analysis and so here are some key areas where we will be conducting additional analysis um often building on what we learned from the modeling but then applying in and so these are just a few examples um we'll be looking at the energy wallet of Representative customer groups to examine the full energy costs um you could think of it as the energy budget of a household and how those costs shift between uh petroleum electricity and gas because ultimately the energy strategy is looking at the tradeoff with different Pathways and those Pathways kind of change the balance maybe within the energy wallet for example if you buy an electric car your your gas bill for that car goes to zero but you're paying more for electricity so we want to make sure to reflect that so the energy wallet helps us see that picture we'll also be looking at Health impacts related to the effects on air quality of decarbonization measures using a model um called Cobra from the um us Environmental Protection Agency and that might be the effect of um reduced Diesel and gasoline powered vehicles on the road and reduced tailpipe emissions resulting from that or reduced biomass combustion for heat so we want to make sure we can reflect some of those benefits we'll also look at different parts of the state to identify differences in impacts across the state um and that can also be applied to look at some of and think about some of the land use considerations that we may not be able to fit in the in the full economy-wide model but we might want to look at more closely um so we'll we'll also be using some of that um kind of differenti around the state to um look at effects of different Pathways at Community level um we'll look at um effects on employment and on the economy so the starting point for the analysis is um really looking at existing models and plans so we're going to ground the analysis in recent utility integ ated resource plans clean energy plans um CPP compliance plans we'll also be reviewing Oregon energy policies and document how the modeling accounts for them so I've already mentioned a number of those those policies um we also will be reviewing from a regional perspective so it's important to take into account the uh Northwest power plan and also to follow key developments um as the uh Northwest power and conservation Council develops the next plan and works on what what will go into that um we'll also look at the um pck the Pacific Northwest utilities conference committee's 2023 Northwest Regional forecast I think there's a more okay yeah um and we'll also be um looking at um a kind of regional program design elements so things like the Western um resource adequacy program um the different energy markets that are under development or already operational in the region and we'll be looking at Regional transmission planning efforts including the Western Transmission expansion westtech so I'm going to pause there because that's that's kind of that kind of wraps up uh the part of the presentation on the modeling and the technical analysis as I mentioned we're in um a really early stage of this and so this is really to give you kind of a shape of um how we the modeling will look um How we'll be working with SEI to um evaluate different uh Pathways and I'd like to pause to see if there are any questions um on everything that's been presented up to now hi Edith I do have a question from bill um he's interested in how local community opposition to Renewables or new transmission systems might be figured into the analysis yeah that's a really good question and it's a difficult question to answer answer right now um at the beginning of this work but I'll say that this is one of the reasons that we are working on an energy strategy because we want to hear we we want to we want to hear from you how you view some of these challenges and some of the issues that are that are coming up in that opposition and to um understand how this analysis could speak to that um and there may be places where there are limits on how much we can do in the technical modeling but I'll I'll just remind everyone that there'll be a policy discussion next year and I think some of these things will more easily be addressed when we talk about policy gaps and policy opportunities but and we're also we're also following I",

        "text": " for the first time that I'm aware they excluded all the utility CEOs and they made it a community thing and so the pressure with more people being engaged even outside of quote Professionals in the business um I I think we're going to feel a shift that I don't know what that looks like but there definitely are different perspectives that we haven't been engaged with previously if I may just kind of reiterate the point that shared robot up about the sort of narrative that's out there this is also one of the reasons why yesterday you know I felt it was important to bring up the farm and Forest report and also the sort of status of you know f-sec solar projects I mean we have 3.6 gigawatts of active solar right now just under f-sect but those narratives that are out there don't talk anything about what's happening they just talk about the need for you know the future and that's why I think it's important that you know that information gets shared it gets put out there obviously the apartment Forest report will be given to the legislature as well so you know we can't sort of change what the narrative is going to be from people but we can at least put the data out there that maybe is you know pushes back on some of that narrative because it's not entirely truthful well thank you chair Grail and Todd for that observations um yeah concur on all fronts um so just to quickly talk about what else again energy being sexy as the chair put it is true um Energy Efficiency is usually not on that list but this time it will definitely be a big issue and it's been a pretty like contentious task force that's been meeting talking about Energy Efficiency in new and existing buildings so we'll see what comes out of that conversation what sort of policy comes out but that'll also be I think sort of the twin big deal on energy um I think these other issues are also really important and likely to likely to come up there or will come up during session incentive programs including extending our solar rebate program which is mostly for a residential scale solar Federal funding and related budget items I'm sure that you all have heard from Todd or from our staff before but if you haven't the agency is getting quite a bit of federal funding directed our way for mostly for Energy Efficiency but for energy projects in general so that's coming up uh Statewide energy strategy is something we actually recommended the state coming up with in our recent biennial Energy report so that's a conversation a couple of legislators are also bringing to the table um two things that you'll definitely want to pay attention to as as a council as well there is a package of legislation being developed on Rural energy development that is being put together by a group called making energy work for Rural Oregon they have a policy committee and they've been working really hard to come up with a package so I'm not sure what would be in that package at this point but I do expect that to come forward and when I come back and talk more with you I can tell you what sort of details were in that if any of them affect citing and then um chair Grail mentioned hydrogen specifically hydrogen and then also offshore wind in particular have been just really hot issues in the state and I expect legislation on both of those from various places probably multiple pieces of legislation and we'll kind of see what gets moving during session any questions on any of that before I move on to the last Quick slide well this is handling and I just make the observation that the last three bullets you had there are pretty related to each other and um it would be interesting to see if there's intertwining among those issues before the session yes you're absolutely right I think that's something we've been thinking is we kind of need to get together and figure out what we want to do as a state and if we just sort of pursue like one-offs is that going to be the most strategic thing so I think you're absolutely right that's a really astute observation and we'll see how they all interact during the session to come and then I can go to the last slide and this is just our calendar for this um so the legislative session you'll see in bold starts January 17th there's always sort of an on-ramp um really I would say December 7th the 9th legislative committee meetings is when we kind of get the preview of what bills are out there and what I haven't heard about yet right so we'll know then and then bills get filed most of the bills that will come up in session get filed December 21st I don't know if WebEx is picking up my cap but I'm so sorry I wanted to be with you all in Hermiston but my husband's out of town so Stockholm and now of course I have a um and then the swearing-in day where the legislators all come together and they'll be like a big speech from the new governor a big speech from the new presiding officers they have to get voted in by the whole chamber on that day that'll all happen on January 9th and then January 17th session starts in Earnest there's a bunch of deadlines that keep the work flowing during the legislative session you can expect that the busiest time will be right around that April 4th first chamber work session deadline it's always a real intense time and then the last day of session will be somewhere between likely June 15th and June 25th which is the last day um under the Constitutional Amendment um or Constitution not necessarily um that uh that the legislature could meet without having a super majority vote to continue which will likely never yeah and just to sort of add into that you know we talked about this in the um but for those who when we weren't here during the long uh last the last long session so we certainly you know evaluate and participate in the you know direct sighting relating bills that you know that will impact f-sec but we also track every land use bill because you know the way the land use system works you know in Oregon is our Landing standard basically ties back to either the direct applicability of lcdc statutes or rules or uh local government uh adopted comprehensive plan and land use ordinances so it's critical that we evaluate those and there are always a flurry of land use bills in every session very long session so many of them you know don't end up being uh completed many of them are unrelated but most of them have relating to Clauses that are so broad that could be converted into anything near the end of the session which then requires a lot of diligence on our part to make sure that we're just keeping an eye on them to understand how they may you know be indirectly affect the council and and you know council's rules and program so it's a lot of work it's the short yes and just a question um has the agency submitted any bills yeah a summary of those blood questions yes yes thanks for asking that's a really good question and I'm sorry for not thinking to include it here um we I think in part because we were waiting to make sure we could submit those bills that the new governor would um approve them or whatever but actually they're being submitted by Governor Kate Brown and so we it's actually not we didn't have to wait it's kind of interesting to find that out so um we have two pieces of legislation that will be um dropped or filed by December 21st one of them is to extend the sunset for that solar rebate program that I mentioned real quickly that's our bill that would do that and also make a technical fix to that solar rebate program and that's been a really successful program that's been really great for sort of distributed solar not the kind of solar you all work on but the kind that's on rooftops of affordable housing or so um so that that bill is one we're really excited about and then we also have legislation that establishes a program at the agency to help communities apply for federal or state funding for energy projects so essentially we want to have a person on our staff a program at our agency that's responsive to community needs and it's specifically geared toward environmental justice communities that are now defined in statute and include rural communities Coastal communities tribal communities low-income communities communities that have a lot of immigrants or communities that have a lot of people of color and then there's also some other other pieces in that definition too like Health equities comes up so it's a pretty broad definition but we want to help essentially local governments it's kind of the target audience there or tribal governments help them uh because we've heard a lot about capacity being an issue in smaller communities or tribal communities so we wanted to be responsive to that to have a person on our staff who can be more of a helpful hand so that's the other piece of legislation we're calling it The thank you thanks for asking other questions do you have anything else Christy nope that's all from me thank you but we will look forward to seeing you regularly during session thank you for your efforts in joining us this morning if there's nothing else we will close that agenda item thank you thank you chair Graham we are now on a break says uh but we don't have any more agenda items because agenda item aged the Westin solar project we've agreed to keep the record open so the applicant can respond to the comments made yesterday so December 2nd is their deadline I believe yes thank um so does anyone have any further questions or comments yes time but outside of the agenda yeah as long as we're concluding that I think we are including that um so you do still have the future dates on the agenda oh oh uh that must have been a hierarchical error um I had that in the secretary court so oh okay that was the intention so that must have been a thought that we didn't uh clarify yeah okay well then if there are no other formal items then we will go ahead yeah I just wanna if if this is councilmember Jenkins last meeting which is unclear at this point I've learned this before that's why it's hard to know that it's sort of been uh multiple times um I just if it is I just want to express my sincere gratitude for the amount of work you know that Haley puts um you know he reads everything uh in fine detail like he gets in so far into the wheat and it makes us so much better and I just greatly appreciate all the time and effort you know that you put into",

to ask but um sean maybe you know what that um yeah mile aid of the channel um and and i don't off top my head i don't know exactly where my leg is but anything west of the mccullough bridge uh area the proposed area would have to be west of the mccullough bridge okay great it looks like um that's what david's tracking with too any other questions for sean otherwise i know jason has a few more slides based on the themes um from the comments so far and then we'll take a lunch break um uh oh i see another question um in the chat from mike would the 475 million dollars for development in tuesday include the heavy equipment needed is that something that was addressed in this study or um that that business oregon has looked at yeah the 475 million that uh mcdonald and simply blue came up with would include everything needed to to build that so yeah the equipment would be included thanks i'll just mention that sean gibbs from south coast development council put a link to the um study in in the chat as well another question from ashley in the chat is is business oregon slash port of coos bay considering the hb 2021 labor standards that someone referenced in an earlier question thanks for that question ashley we'll put we'll put a link to our website that talks a little bit more about the hp 2021 labor standards um but i'll check to see if sean or or if anyone from the portico's base on the line would like to talk about that i don't have enough knowledge to i think we think that if it wasn't in our draft literature report i think it was though um at least we had a mentioned mention of it somewhere um and i admit it's going to come up in the feedback we receive too so it's good feedback maybe that's a good segue um jason to the slides that you have yeah i i mean i think sean might leave us here in the next few minutes um and i was kind of looking ahead to those slides in anticipation of maybe any other questions that might come up um you know regionalization on this economic development kind of like with the multiple ports sean i don't know as do you know anything about any engagement to cr have you been contacted or is there any kind of any thoughts on on that kind of multiple coordination across different ports you know whether it's in oregon or outside of oregon um i i haven't really i haven't really seen any developers that are have inquired about other ports outside of coos bay they're mostly right now targeting the coos bay area i you know the other the other site or the other port that's under consideration is humble in in california and that you know it seems to kind of be the two bookends of the of this area i think the general consensus is that as we reach critical mass with this industry that you know we'll continue to build out and attract more supply chain companies uh to service this industry and you know manufacture parts and pieces of the of the turbines and and don't necessarily have to be located at the porta coos bay they could be located uh elsewhere in the region or elsewhere in oregon too transport those into to the term manufacturing terminal at the portuguese bay thanks john and we also had some feedback on uh potential you know we've been talking about maybe the economic benefits from offshore wind but um we did get some feedback about kind of balancing and looking at like the net benefits i don't know if that's something that business oregon would take a look at or would it be a different different entity maybe not a state entity maybe it'd be a private study or something but net benefits as far as yeah so like you know as i understand business organization you talked about the green economy and some of the sustainable economic development so you're interested in economic development and then does that kind of factor in the industry you're trying to maybe help that we got feedback that supporting an industry or bringing on another industry kind of have trade-offs i guess would be one way to put it but um there could be maybe negative impacts to other industries and trying to figure out how best to balance that is like the optimization is that tied to part of the analysis that business oregon has typically done for some of those industries that you've looked at in the past or would consider doing for like offshore wind yeah i think it i think it's under cons you know it's under consideration uh you know we're watching closely uh you know this study and and other studies from bowman etc that and and taking into account the the other industries and how they're affected um you know yeah maybe there's more analysis like i mean i don't know if you've thought about that or you know not to put you on the spot i was trying to jump ahead i think jason's starting to cover some of the topics in his later slides because he's worried he won't be there um there are a few other uh comments here in the chat i just wanted to um surface and um looking to take a lunch break here in the next 15 or 20 minutes so um yeah i wanted to make sure we had time for that um in addition to the hb 2021 labor standards question that ashley asked she asked um if there's any considerations about community benefit agreements um i also added to the chat um a website that odo hosts on the hb 2021 labor standards attestations that toxic that basically is our to comply with that part of the the statute which is that any person who constructs or repowers a renewable energy generation sequestration or storage facility with a capacity of 10 megawatts or greater in oregon is required to comply with hp 2021 responsible labor standards and then shannon asked whether boem could comment on the potential for multi-port collaboration and the scope of their pacific coast port assessment um so whitney i'm not sure if you um have the chance to do that now before jason jumps into his slides sure so um i don't think shannon thanks for the question i don't know how much i can can share there is a study in procurement right now but in looking at a regional assessment with california so it's not a pacific coast wide it's focused in in california as a part of sort of as in coordination or collaboration with the state of california and ab525 uh runfies asked whether there was a link to the procurement for that study whitney in case you or one of your colleagues have that link available for the chat um go ahead jason oh i was just getting us ready uh yeah and shawn you know thanks a lot um if you need to depart um we may lose sean so thanks again and i'm gonna shift into the feedback we received so the bill specifically listed jobs is something for us to take a look at you know kind of in in the threat of the benefits and challenges analysis so the department asked a few questions about about this topic you know are there local job forces that might benefit from the type of work activity that offshore wind could bring to the um how could potential economic development benefits accrue to different communities and states we talked a little bit about that from sean's our economic benefits expected to primarily be confined to port areas where the floating offshore winds deployed could there be trade-offs between the economic benefits of flooding offshore wind potential effects to existing port economies something i touched on and then how could uh floating offshore wouldn't lead to a net positive economic benefit so that that's kind of a refresher of questions we asked um i have a few slides just summarizing the themes we heard so economic benefits are going to be significantly tied to the ports um that makes sense that that was kind of a finding from the literature review as well but there is an opportunity for the supply chains to kind of spread further and reach beyond reach beyond the ports and then you know there's also the opportunity for multiple ports so port upgrades could also benefit other industries including fishing and marine transportation that was flagged i heard a reference to john gibbs being on the meeting thanks for joining sean um i think you chatted something earlier with your role down down in that south coast area you may be able to add more to this channel modification project if people are interested in that but um i'll just keep moving on for now and get us to the additional feedback period um but this this channel modification project was flagged as something um it's been in the works for a long time and you know it could be it could be um a springboard or you know something that has synergistic benefits floating offshore when we're ever to come to coos bay um there could be some some value to that project going forward but we also talked about the dredging concerns so lots of issues bundled up there flooding offshore wind can do this to bring the supply chain growth and i think we've talked about that enough um so location of economic benefits we had some themes around this topic we talked about the supply chains collaborative regional approach um we talked about you know at a high level some of the pros and cons of that but that was feedback we received and then there'd be also additional economic benefits from transmission upgrades around the interconnections in other parts of the state potentially if floating offshore wind were developed at scale there's been studies that indicate the transmission system would need to get upgraded as well so different aspects of economic job development potential here's here's the net economic benefit feedback we received as you can see there was different views and these views need to be balanced at the end of the day um if floating offshore wind you know does does kind of it could could bring benefits but it could also have adverse impacts to existing industries such as fisheries some of the opportunities for offshore wind would be to help complement cyclical downturns in existing industries such as timber and fisheries overall i think we got a few pieces of feedback highlighting kind of both sides of this and then other pieces of feedback talking about these opportunities to create mutually beneficial strategic partnerships across different industries indirect economic benefits was also service industries like hospitality and recreation other support services if there's an influx of",

        "text": " more time on that first question only only anyone online if you are done please do raise your hand and let us know so that we'll know that you had enough time we can move on okay we're going to go ahead um and move on if you're online please do take a minute to answer that before we reach the next section of questions and slido so as I mentioned before we're going to walk through our preliminary results through this portion of our time together and we're going to have a rhythm to our interaction a lot of this is aimed at getting your feedback your reactions to what we heard thus far and our preliminary results so we're going to start with the feedback from stakeholders I'll let you know who has responded what they've been telling us what their feedback is and then we'll do a quick check in then we'll move on to the actual risk assessment and we'll go through each of the sub sectors so talking through electricity then natural gas and liquid fuels and I'll show you again who has been engaging with us give you the final vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix which is also in your handout so you have access to that I'll walk through some details related to Adaptive capacity feedback and then we'll do a checkin to get your impression of these results the last round of Engagement um with this rhythm is going to be the risk mitigation measures here we're going to break it into four categories first we're going to do very high level risk mitigation measures that could apply to all systems and then we'll walk through each of the um s sectors so electricity natural gas and then liquid fuels and our approach here is really that I'm going to tee up these mitigation measures for you and then most of the time at this point we actually s with you guys giving us feedback okay so getting started on stakeholder engagement um we have had a total of 144 folks engag with us thus far before beginning the road show and their distribution and quantity is sumarized in the map on the left so here you have each of the circles size based on the number of respondents relative to each other and then color coded based on the region that they're located in in the top right you can see that the majority folks fall into the yellow box which represents government the light blue is um the consumer owned utility so we have a good number there the dark blue is the private sector and then up in the light yellow in the very top corner is um nonprofits so those some of our major categories of representation and to our knowledge 15% of the folks who've engaged with us thus far do have some association with environmental justice issues so what have we' been asking them well as I mentioned before we wanted to have a better understanding of the threats that are disrupting the energy system and so here we have a map that breaks down the types of threats that have been cited across all of our engagement efforts so we have a pie chart for each of the different regions each slice of the pie is representing one of these different threads and what you'll notice here is a um pattern starting from merge and so you'll see the the light pink the red and the dark purple those slices the pie tend to be biggest across all of the regions so the pink is winter storm the purple is wind storm and the red is Wildfire so we consistently see these threads um rising to the top with regarded priority and concern on a regular basis we also asked which of the energy sub sectors tends to be affected the most by these disruptions electricity sub sector was cited most frequently and that was followed by liquid fuels in this cas specifically petroleum and then natural gas something important to note about this barart chart on the left that summarizes this is that we did have more engagement from the private sector in the liquid fuels sub sector than we did relative to electricity and natural gas and so it could be that those um disruptions that are SED the liquid fuels could be disproportionately large relative to electricity and natural gas the bar chart on the right shows us the time that it takes to restore service and so so the most common response across all three sors is it really takes less than a week that's the most um common time period that's required we have a number of questions on preparedness what I'm showing here is just backup generators so this is telling us how many folks know that a backup generator is available either to them or their organization that's in the dark blue the yellow is that there is not a backup generator available and then the gray is that it's unknown so you can see it's roughly divided into those that do have a backup generator what we did find is there there's a lot of variability with regard to the operation capacity of that generator so there were a few that say we could um we still have full operational capacity from our generator but it could be as low as um just a safe shutdown um some feedback on environmental justice the pie chart on the left is showing us the communities that are most often cited as um Comm of concern for EJ issues and so the most common sightings are the dark blue is low income community and the dark yellow is the rural community and then what is actually impacting these communities the most common um concern is related to power supply disruptions so this does mirror what we saw earlier where the most common SE Subs sector being impacted is the electricity sub sector um the next in line is toxic fum exposure but it's obviously significantly less um less frequently cited than the power distractions okay so we're going back to slido this is one of the larger um collections of questions that we're going to ask you to answer question number two is just asking you to think about what other stakeholders have told us thus far and let us know if anything resonates with you are we on the right track are people telling us what we should be hearing and you agree with it in contrast question number three is asking do you dis agree with what we're hearing is your experience different your knowledge of whatever the system is is it different from other people but other people are telling us and then questions 4 through eight all relate to environmental justice just getting more information on what these concerns are and even um potential options to resolve some of those concerns so please take a moment to work through these questions we will pause and again if you're online if you can raise your hand once you finish these questions that would help us out so that we know that you're ready to e e we'll give you another minute to work on these questions and see if people are ready to reply e looks like several books are still working I just want to make sure need time good deal all right let's go ahead and move on to the next section and now what we're going to get it to are the preliminary results of the risk assessment we're starting with the electricity sub sector as I mentioned before we have 41 Utilities in state and many of these do serve multiple regions so we touched on this earlier just looking what our potential sample size could be across the different regions it ranges based on surface area it ranges from 7 to 11 here in the Portland metro seven and so we got about a 50% response rate from the utilities 20 out of those 41 utilities did respond the three I iods did participate in the survey and here we have the actual sample size across the regions ranging from four to n in Portland metro six and here we have our overall vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix again this is in your handout um so you can reference that Beyond this this this slide right here um we have the regions across the top the threats along the side put a little box around your region so you can just um go to it quickly and I'll highlight a few um takeaways from some of the results that led to these brain games um first of all something important to note is that the electricity sub sector most often prioritized four threats in their feedback to us that included Cyber attack and then as I mentioned before that pattern that we started to see we have Wildfire wind storm and winter storm all of the cells that have a box around them here are largely driven by exposure and impact ratings that tended to be higher relative to other regions so you can see for the Portland metro area the exposure and impact rating for flood and Wildfire tended to be a bit higher than um some of your neighbors and then here this high score for Drought was largely driven by adaptive capacity so you can see um the Adaptive capacity score um was a little bit uh less mature for drought and for the metal area relative to the other regions now for the human po threats there are a few key points that I want to highlight first of all a lot of thisinformation is largely um representative of the smaller utilities while the larger utilities did complete the survey they largely did not respond to questions as they relate to human caus spreads and so these rankings really don't reflect the larger utilities very much the higher rankings here are largely driven by exposure and impact scores and it's important to note that some of these values are artificially low so you'll notice that for the eastern and Portland metro areas you guys both have a score of two it's folded and it's underlined the reason we know these are artificially low is because nobody gave us any information on impact as it relates to human caits and so we couldn't assign a value to potential impact had we had a value would have increased the score you might also notice that there's very little variabil across the regions for a given threat there's more variability across the threats for a given region but we can dig into the nuances of some of the feedback to start to understand where the variability lies and so this is why I want to get into adaptive capacity a bit so first I'll just walk you through how we approach the Adaptive capacity you do not have to study this I can see some big eyes you do have a copy of this in your handout if you're curious about the details the takeaway from this slide is we gave this table to the utilities and the um measures are categorized into five categories so we have identify protect detect respond and recover if you're curious about what some examples of these measured for like they're in your handout you can read through them as you're curious we gave a similar one related to physical attacks as well so we give them this table and then we ask them to tell",

        "text": " one of the big takeaways from this we have this TR tremendous resource for use in Oregon standard 100 has a tremendous amount of content that is very useful for imple implementing a BPS but you we can't just adopt it as is it really has to be adapted to align with both the realities and the needs of Oregon and we'll pause once again for any questions I will stop presenting so that I can actually see Blake are there any that you would like I'm just now looking at them so I want to see if there's any that need my attention I so I maybe not specific to your presentation but about ashray standard 2024 will there be a link on our website for a copy of the standard and I think I saw another question about um so ashray does offer their standards for a free readon version but I actually noticed that the most recent version of standard 100 is the 2018 version up on their read only so I would expect that it'll be up on their website on their free rate only um the newest version sometime soon I I don't know exactly when I don't know the timing either um however I do know that it is complete so it is in publication version I mean we are in 2024 so this is actually a case where uh the version of a standard is available in the year that is is in its title um I know that full versions of them are out there but they are under restricted use right now so I am a non-voting member of the committee that works on standard 100 so I have one and I am not allowed to share it uh but it will be an important piece that we'll make sure that the people who are working on the adaptation of standard 100 have access to to the content so that we can effectively use it and then yeah and then I'll mention too so as we go through our rule making process we'll be integrating our um our organ specific requirements into the standard 100 100 language so like those sections of 100 as we work on them will be part of our rule review and then after we're done with our rules and we have the integrated Oregon version that takes standard 100 and modifies it for Oregon um and come up with you know that complete package that complete document that will be available on our website for download for the Oregon integrated version of it for free but you know that'll only be complete after we're done with our rules so like the Oregon version of standard 100 will be there free at the end of our so that's it yeah for me so yeah feel free to continue Sean I don't think I see any other questions in there now oh I do see so Washington State posted a copy on their website during the ru making I I'll have to see I know we have a licensing agreement with ashray for it I I can definitely ask to see if that's something that's possible under our under our licensing agreement I don't want to uh you know proom promise anything if that's something that actually wouldn't be okay with our with our agreement but I I can definitely look into and there was a question about um five 0000001 and my understanding is that is a a good way to think about that would be an international version of um standard 100 or not I I don't want to give the the the impression that it's like an adapted version of standard 100 but it's a it's like standard 100 in it purpose but it's from a more perspective um Sean do you have additional slides to go through or are we kind of at the question and answer no we we really wanted to keep this high level as an introduction for people to the standard and not overwhelm them with a lot of details so as as we move through this process we of course always are going to to welcome questions and so we can move on to our next item okay great um okay yeah so the the last item on really on the agenda is just kind of closing and next steps and opportunity for Q&amp;A and I've gone through the um you I've tried to go through some of the questions that were asked during my portion and answer those um so hopefully if you asked a question I know it's a little bit clunky in the chat to see like the the question answer but I tried to list the question first and then provide an answer to it um as I went through but I don't think I got to everything yet so I I'll kind of just try to scan through here and um and see if there are any uh I guess I see one here so for state agencies that own buildings we already do much of this for buildings over 5,000 square feet VI the seed program with the annual seed report so this is for state buildings only cover this there will there will be additional reporting requirement um so we do have um what we do recognize that with building performance standards a lot of what's required through BPS is already being done at the state level we are um closely looking at opportunities to consolidate that effort so that state agencies don't need to like double report and uh reduce we want to reduce the amount of duplicate uh work required um so yeah we're we're really looking into streamlining that maybe reducing the State Building um seed report activities if they're covered buildings under under the BPS you know for some of those buildings that are under the BPS threshold but over what we typically track through state agency usage 5,000 square feet and above we'll probably still want to keep tracking those but I think there's an opportunity to to consolidate for um let's see just scanning through if there's any questions um that I haven't answered yet uh I'll kind of go back up to the top there's a question about um where will the rfps be listed so those would be listed on um organ buys once they're once they're posted if you've signed up to receive notifications from the state procurement system organ buys that's where they'll be listed um are we still adding to the ru making advisory committee um the committee for the tier one buildings is is set um but we do want to get input on the tier two uh R making advisory committee and just a note too you know if you're if you're not on the rle making advisory committee for tier one buildings um and the ru making that we're doing this year um you know not just tier one but all the ru making we're doing this year um but still wanted to monitor that rack activity those will be open to the public too um and there's definitely the opportunity to comment we don't want to um certainly don't want to limit input on our rul making to just the members of the of the committee it's open to you know we'll consider just as as much members that aren't on the committee um there's a question about every state agency is under order from the governor under executive order 2004 to exercise any and all authority and discretion to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 80% below 1990 Levels by 2050 how will oo prioritize decisions in the rulem to ensure this program follows that order um so yeah I think this question kind of goes back to what I was covering at the beginning of the um of the presentation where programs like building performance standards are um you know policies that help address like one component of State energy use and St and achieving that goal so when we look at all of the different policies to help us get to that goal of 80% reduction below 1990 levels like you look at um like the clean electricity requirements um deq's climate Protection Program our energy codes energy Appliance standards um clean fuels Transportation like what impact will or what effect will each of those programs have on our state energy um and greenhouse gas emissions um you know then you have to consider what else is needed to help us get to the goals so building performance standards was really the the policy that kind of rose to the top for existing buildings to to cover existing buildings component of our Statewide greenhous gas emissions to help us close that Gap to where we need to be it was part of a uh legislative task force requirement an interim task force that occurred before the 2023 session so um you know I think you know certainly through our our implementation of the BPS IT addresses emissions from existing buildings um you know we we're limited and directed to looking at site energy use but certainly setting those targets will help reduce energy use which in turns help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings um and that's kind of how we're prioritizing our our Outlook and framework of the program to help get to those greenhouse gas reduction goals we see it as a as a critical component to helping our state get there um How will I see a question about how will data be received from the owners um it will be primarily reported through the plan is to have it reported through energy start portfolio manager and then have our um our database our BPS database kind of overlay and extract data from portfolio manager uh portfolio managers kind of the the standard in the industry I think most folks are it's free um you know a lot of building owners are familiar with it if they've ever reported their energy use to like the city of Portland that uses commercial or that has a commercial building benchmarking program or if they've applied for an energy star score um it's kind of the standard in the industry so we're um hoping to leverage that um let's I'm trying to scan through let's see I don't know it's kind of hard to see questions that I that I haven't answered but I'll certainly go through the chat afterward and if there's any that I haven't answered um try to answer those oh uh Medical Office Buildings healthc care but not Hospital fall under tier one or tier two oh no I don't think I answered that one yet um I at this point I think think those would actually be a tier one building um classified under more of an of an office building not a not a hospital as long as it is just a like a separate and distinct um office type building and doesn't actually include any sort of like uh Healthcare activities in it um what are the alternatives for campuses that do not have building level metering this is something that we're interested in hearing from stakeholders as we go through our process for sure I think some other jurisdictions have um applied a campus level approach as as a potential pathway for compliance",

you see more you can click on that and it'll bring up information about that specific event if you know a year you want to jump to you can go down to this very bottom bar with these nice little highlight bubbles so let's click on 1979 it'll squish you all the way to the all the way to that date and you can look in that area I want you to note this wrench this has a lot of power down here this search bar is actually really useful and it is a good search bar you could put in something like the word solar and all of the events that have that word solar in it will be highlighted and you could cruise through you have categories and those are just what I showed you in the sub timeline and then view type is really nice if you don't like seeing those sub um sub timelines you can just go to a standard View and just get all of the events right there and just take your and uh and explore on through so let's go ahead and close that and let's honor your selection of theme is energy policy which I have to admit I'm a little surprised but let's do it so we'll go all the way back to the click back on this wrench the Sierra sub energy policy there we are so let's move see if I can move my face so I don't have to see that okay so you can see it's more of a magenta color here we like to call it tulip and all of the energy policies will be in this line so of course way back in Missoula flood times there's not going to be any energy policies we'll just keep going forward so it looks like our very first one is a public utility Act of 1911. not much happening there but at least you get a start we have more activity as time goes on yep 1919 to 1920 to 1935. so this was interesting um Oregon passes first per gallon State gasoline tax that's really interesting there's some information there the further we get along we'll start more media choices and more photographs there's President Roosevelt there this is um really big for the states sorry about that establishes the rural electrification through let me see if I can get you some multimedia in one of these the energy policy events are a little more straightforward um but I'm definitely going to get you some of the the ones with a little bit of audio and let's go down to 1941 I'm not sure how familiar you guys are but um Woody Guthrie was actually employed by BPA and he was hired to write songs and produce 26 songs in the 30 days of his Employments there and one of these the most famous song is Roll on Columbia and if you take a look at this event you can see at the very top left here you have images which is one that's displayed and then audio if there is any audio it'll show right there so let's take a look at this first one looks like we've got three songs that you can explore a play about five seconds of that okay so a lot of fun there was so much information out there we had a lot of fun collecting it um it's it's a living timeline we add to it and change things regularly when needed to be so let's still go along our energy policies look 1946 Congress passes the atomic energy Act of 1946. that was a big deal too let's see if I can find something with some more you guys chose the most straightforward one hey Erica just so you know the audio wasn't working so media might not be helpful at this time thank you for that with WebEx is the intermediary between the the timeline in our audience well sometimes audio doesn't work but if you get on here and play play with it yourself there's a lot of really really great media to experience that is a bummer we tested but what are you gonna do um we also have policies that weren't necessarily uh just Oregon this was a national and it still was very uh important for oregonians in the state as well and energy development we have the Oregon Department of energy developed in 1975. that's a neat blurb there we've got some we'll go through this was a lot of fun as I mentioned we were able to collect a lot of information one of those things that we did is we're invited and reached out to different um different organizations and people across the state to do original interviews and Janine helped me uh secure an interview with Congressman Peter DeFazio back in I want to say September and were able to go visit him and had a great conversation about uh when Congress passed the Pacific Northwest Electric Power planning conservation act it's a must listen you can find out more here I have links in a lot of these events and then also audio you'll find the whole interview there there's a fun uh image of Congressman DeFazio and Janine keep on going let's see what our very last energy policy is Clean Air Act amendments pass in 1990 this uh green subline sub timeline of diverse energy contributors is really um and we're adding more and more this you know just the nature of things that's taken a bit more research to to find these events but there are events and it's um it's a great learning okay it looks like our last one was in 2021 and Oregon legislature passes House Bill the Oregon legislator passed House Bill 2021 which introduced a broad range of actions including a target of 100 admissions free electricity from Oregon's large investor-owned utilities and electricity service suppliers by 2040. to find out more link there and I believe this one goes yep to the opp article so lots of fantastic things I really encourage you to to explore it we want to get this in front of all kinds of different people and like I said it's a it's a living tool and we'll keep adding to it I'll go ahead and stop sharing now and at this time were there any I'm not seeing any in the chat Jessica have you received any questions for Erica I I did not I apologize for my tardiness I lost my Mouse um it happens uh no questions but I would just like to add Erica that Jessica Arnold uh thank you for the she said the timeline is amazing and um appreciated the work that is fantastic thank you so much Jessica and please check out the events uh it was a bummer the audio wasn't working but it's worth it so so to take a moment for that thank you everyone for your thank you Erica and thank you for putting this all together it is impressive and really shows the amount of work that went into it so I encourage everybody to spend some time with it there's so much great great material on there we are now to our second vote um and this one has to do with energy resource and Technology reviews and this section builds upon what was in the 2018 and 2020 reports the section features six categories of energy resources and technologies that we use or produce here in Oregon covering the Spectrum from traditional to truly innovative you can see the topics on the right hand side everything from electricity generating Technologies to hydrogen but for this portion of the webinar you again get to Choose Your Own Adventure and hopefully slido will refresh itself on the right side of your screen if it doesn't you might have to adjust the little arrow to the left of the slido brand name and if you can get that to work you'll see see two choices the first being energy efficient building Technologies including heat pumps which are quite popular in many Realms of discussion lately and the second option is transportation fuels so please choose the option that most interests you and we'll have an expert lead you through that topic it looks like we have a tie so far so if you have not yet voted please do so and we'll give folks just a few more seconds to get those votes in okay I think I'm about ready to to call the election here and we will be learning about energy efficient building Technologies featuring heat pumps and leading us through that will bring Stephanie Cruz our facilities engineer and Stephanie you've got the mic great thanks again Andy um you're missing out not going through Transportation fuels with Michael but uh maybe that's gonna be uh hosted in a future webinar so like Richie have a moment to get our slides rolling thank you to Ruchi for uh commanding the Empire of slides in the background we really appreciate it so um this technology review provides more information on energy efficient equipment including heat pumps water heaters smart devices and appliances including the history of each type of Technology Trends and potential and Beyond energy considerations Energy Efficiency saves the Pacific Northwest rate payers over four billion dollars and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 22 million metric tons per of carbon dioxide per year challenges to continue to Energy Efficiency and achievements include access to capital for Energy Efficiency Investments including decreased investment and cost-effective Energy Efficiency competition from low-cost renewable solar and wind resources limited availability of Technologies and lack of consumer familiarity with efficiency products and recent supply chain and shipping delays related to the covid-19 pandemic but advances in Energy Efficiency have helped utilities manage Regional demand and reliability for energy improved energy bills and thus reduced energy burden for many oregonians and contributed to progress towards state and local climate goals there remain significant Energy Efficiency potential to continue to provide these benefits advanced technology adoption rates vary according to many factors but costs and barriers can leave some groups behind incentives and Market transformation efforts that focus on closing these gaps will help achieve regional and local so first category is heat pumps in 2017 about 15 percent of single-family households in the Pacific Northwest used heat pump as the primary heating system uh research from Washington State showed an increase in the number of households using electricity for heating from approximately 20 to 90 percent of surveyed respondents which indicates an increase in homes using electric Technologies like he's heat pumps for for their homes our audience could be about 50 on home heating costs with a heat pump compared with electric resistance heat like a Cadet at Urban Sports heater heat pumps move heat rather than create it and heating the heat pumps collect heat from the in and outdoor temperature temperatures concentrate it and then turn up heat into the building even on cold days in cooling mode heat pumps operate like regular air",

        "text": " I'm Calen tardyweather senior citing analyst and Lead uh on this um this is an informational item my portion of the presentation and then the hearing that um the hearing officer will this is an overview of what we're going to go over tonight um I'm going to do a very brief project um Council we're going to talk more about this facility tomorrow if things if we end up moving in that direction and I'll go over that of like the next steps later um and then um hearing officer is going to conduct uh the public hearing and at that public hearing the applicant will be able to provide their comments um or any comments that they have um on the draft proposed order in that I'm just going to pause for a second Council has been sent the comments received onto on the record as of what yesterday I think um so um and which did include the comments from the applicant so Council has received those and to this moment in time right now we also received one written copy that we have here that we can scan an email um from a gentleman from the union and then we also got a comment letter from the Department of Aviation so those are that's what's that's what's come into at this moment um and so and again the applicant will also receive all of the DPO comments um um then so after the applicant can comment on the DPO members of the public will be provided an opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order or the application for site certificate then we'll open it up and Council can um identify any issues or have any any comments in which case um after that um the applicant and maybe might be better for the applicant to respond but we staff can also help uh Council navigate where information may be found in the record or how we drafted findings recommendations or conditions in the draft proposed order but at the end the applicant will be provided an opportunity to respond um to any of the above so at this so that's kind of the structure of the evening um and I always feel like this is like weird unless like turn around and talk to everybody behind me because the council kind of this is you Council so this is even though I'm sitting this way this is for the folks in the room this is intended to be informative for folks that are new to the Essex process um maybe this is your first um council meeting that you've been to thank you for coming that's awesome thank you for participating so this is really for for the folks behind me and I'm sorry that I'm not looking at you okay so the the energy facility signing Council or fsec review process is a Consolidated State review process to where um a developer or we'll call an applicant can come and it's like One-Stop shopping for um decisions and permits that may apply to large-scale energy facilities in Oregon so Council has jurisdiction over several different types of facility abilities usually what we're talking about here what council reviews are big energy facilities transmission lines utility scale solar wind we talked about some we had the missed underground facility and have Cogen projects so we have we review and have expertise over lots of different types of facilities we have councils made up of seven members we have six uh with us tonight either remotely or in person thank you also for being here um and our council members are volunteers and their governor appointed and Senate confirmed and then um myself uh Todd Cornett Sarah esterson Wally and Nancy over there odo's citing division staff we are staffed to F6 so we do technical and legal review drafting the driving to meetings and having a blast um so that's that's us okay so this I know for us in the room this slide might be a little bit hard to um I also want to note that we did a uh we deemed to the application complete in and we had an informational meeting um which was noticed in the newspaper and mailed to property owners and sent to agencies um in in October um we had some of the landowners and um folks from odf and W uh show up but the informational meeting on the complete application is really trying to set people up for this step because this step and commenting and coming here today to comment on the DPO is an essential step in the process to be able to move forward if desired in councils in council's process um councils used to seeing the Chevron and I'm sorry people in room can't really read it this is very typical but this is kind of interesting because this is actually a facility that's being reviewed under council's expedited review rules which we don't really see that often um expedited there's two categories of facilities that would qualify for an expedited review the one we're looking at is there's rules that are for um expedited review for small capacity facilities and these are facilities that are 100 megawatts or less so the primary difference in the rules is that for a regular application for site certificate an applicant submits a notice of intent which is an noi and that goes out for public comment informational meeting reviewing agency comments and then after that we write a project order which says this is what needs to be in the application and then the application process starts there's no notice of intent for um for an expedited review which is really just kind of a beginning scoping phase in the council's process um so uh the first step aside from requesting an expedited review and having the department respond to that the first time the first thing the department gets is actually the preliminary application so after the preliminary application then we issue the project order which says this is what this needs to be in the application and then we review the application with reviewing agencies and Deema complete but but then everything afterwards is the same except there is a little Nuance in there that for an expedited review from the date of the complete um Council has six months to get to a final decision if there's not a contested case um we're well within that time we we deemed the application complete in September and we're here so we're we're we're we're we're turning turning it around quickly here so um we're here uh the next steps I'm going to go over well I will go over it now but I'll talk later and also the hearing officer is going to talk more about why it's so critical to participate at this draft post order stage but after the draft proposed order uh the the hearing closes uh and the record closes after the hearing closes which means that means that there's no more information that's added to that application to add to the preponderance of evidence right so once the record closes after the hearing um the record is closed now if a project goes into the contested case record opens back up but at this time or at the close of the hearing the record closes so no more information so that's kind of kind of going back of why Apple applicant public Council and the applicant gets an opportunity to respond to all of that now while the records open but after the record closes Council then reviews the draft proposed order so we have that scheduled on the agenda to be tomorrow right and so I'm saying I'll talk more about the facility and go through more um and that's going to be tomorrow assuming we close record and move forward that said the next step is issuing the Department issues the proposed or yes I'm sorry proposed order which is a document that responds to the comments from the public applicant and at that time we issue a notice of contested case and then the Chevrons proceed so very um quick overview um the Western solar project is uh you know right here in Umatilla County I think uh Todd and I drove by the other day it sounds like Hanley maybe drove by um the applicant is EE Westin which is a subsidiary of Uris solar Holdings um this is a new applicant um uh to the f-sec process the facility is a proposed 50 megawatt solar energy facility on a 324 acre um parcel within a site boundary of 324 Acres which is kind of small compared to what council kind of sees and it's interesting like well why is that acre threshold why is it coming in front of council and it goes into the definitions of high value farmland and we have that peel off in the rules that is that that the Ava um which is the the American agriculture area American viticulture area so that is that's that's why that's why we're um and of course as with most uh projects the energy facility which is a solar energy facility includes its related or supporting facilities and so uh the related supporting facilities includes battery storage uh substation switching station and O M enclosure access roads Service Roads an interesting note about this site is that the applicants not proposing a transmission line because there's three transmission lines that are either immediately adjacent to or cross over the facility site that they're proposing to interconnect with so that's that's an um uh aspect of this site um I don't need to go through this it's pretty straightforward this mirrors those Chevrons we saw um on on that slide I think the interesting of notes so that preliminary application was submitted in November 5th and here we are we're doing a DPO hearing about a year later so so that's what happened and of course you know like what's happening in all that time this is us most of what the department and applicant are doing at this time is we're doing information requests we're working with reviewing agencies they're asking questions the applicants responding we're going back and forth getting that application to where the application is complete and a complete application is not an approval it just means there's sufficient information for us to draft findings and recommendations and conditions in a draft proposed order so that's that's what happens in that time Gap and a bunch of other really exciting things but that's supposed to say so a lot of what I'm gonna go over um by um Allison green Webster presiding over the hearing so issuance of the draft proposed order uh it initiates a public comment period so there's been a 22-day comment period where folks can provide their comments either you know via email we have an online comment portal um folks can come and provide oral testimony here tonight either in person or through the webinar um folks can also provide comments in writing tonight uh you can fax it I haven't gotten any facts comments but you could somebody could do that it still exists um and why it's important to comment on the DPO if you want to participate further in the council's process you have to comment on the DPO um the council's process it's the contested case proceeding it's",

        "text": " that end Market development did you and other partners have to work on in order to put the recycle plus program together most of these end markets were there they they've existed they're difficult to access they have very stringent quality requirements um plastic bags and film is a great example they're almost a zero tolerance for moisture um wet bags don't go into their system and you'll that's the main reason it has to be a lid on the recycle plus bin and the lid has to be secured so collecting that at the curb has been really challenging we can't put it in the regular bin because it gums up the recycling facility so we have to separate it we have to keep it dry they do have historically taken the film from grocery stores at the take back in front of the store for plastic bags so trekka's Trex is a strong Market their facilities in Reno Nevada they do lots of drives for film they partner with school districts and do plastic film drives so it's a mature Market it's just very picky and we have to have really unique practices and processes to get it there and it's challenging to integrate those into a curbside system um the most kind of evolving Market is this recycled Pet Market and D6 and green impact Plastics are players in that market and it's changing constantly the Oregon DQ just did a request for information for pet recyclers and there's lots of clamor in the in the market for more capacity there's a lot of consumer products companies that want to put more recycled content into their products and and boost their sustainability efforts on the store shelves so that market is rapidly growing it's right now there's really only those two players that are kind of doing it so the maturity of that market is risky and that's what recycle plus is able to take those risks because we can take things in and out of it so if it we don't have this big mix of things that we don't know how to unmix we can easily kind of pull a bag out of that out of that program so that's the most kind of balancing Market I expect it's going to get better over the next um five years as well and especially with the recycling modernization act we're seeing these companies come in and say we want our pet in the program and the state's saying build more mature markets and guarantee us you can recycle it and we'll get them into the program and so I think that's a big incentive for those those companies as well textiles is an interesting one this is a down cycling process so we're not really recycling we're creating absorbent Rags which is good with it's another life for these materials um if they're good quality products donating them is better um Pioneer wiping cloth does try to glean for donations but if you have a box a bag full of jeans Goodwill is probably a better place to take it because it's more likely to end up back in circulation and on the store shelf it's an option for things that are past their life or torn or ripped and it's a local market it's a local business been a place for 100 years so it's just now kind of building these Partnerships with the solid waste system more and it was usually working on the back end of those donation systems um and then these other facilities like um they've been around a long time they processed the electronic waste from the Oregon e-cycles program and so they have a big state contract for that so they're a big reclaimer and a lot of that kind of filters down into the steel and and scrap industry once it's separated and captured so markets have been there they're fluctuating maturing they have really strict requirements and so this programs are designed specifically to meet those requirements and get those materials in and most the time that can happen easier at the Depot where this we're asking community members to separate and bring it in but this is basically bringing the depot to the curb well thank you for that work uh my colleagues know that I was away again last week back in New Hampshire and uh my cousin Tony Tony Sapienza is on the city council in Manchester New Hampshire and so we geek out occasionally policy and public programs and they don't have the level of markets that we have here so uh right now they're co-mingled recycle bin content is going right to the same Wheelabrator incinerator that there garbages so they feel good because they put it in a different camp but it ends up yeah that's not what we want what's the cost I can of the recycle plus program so 250 a month for being a member of theirs or you know entering enrolling in the program I'm not sure what word is the right word and then when you need to pick up it's 9.25 per pickup and we're seeing from the data that folks are getting picked UPS like every 10 weeks so it's like we thought it's a little bit less frequent I think everybody brings the bin in their home and they're expecting to always need it and it takes a little while to accumulate these products and materials and then about every 10 weeks they subscribe for pickup we're gonna figure it's just my opinion but got to figure out how to make that a free service because I would bet that especially in Senior Communities and others that are going to say I don't want to pay for an extra bin and pick up I'll just throw in the garbage can and then it it has to be some incentive to do the right thing yeah I don't disagree with you it's you know it's all about paying for the cost of the service right and we are closely watching the development of the recycling modernization act and and the state is inviting these producer responsibility organizations into the state to help fund these systems many of these products are ending up on what they're calling a pro which is producer responsibility organization Depot list which means that organizations will have to develop a network of Depots where folks can bring these products and we're talking about there's a section in the state law that says you know the pros must work with local to arrange a Depot Network or an alternative method for collection and we're capturing seizing on that that clock or clause and asking the state if there's an opportunity for us to say Hey you could build less Depots in Washington County if you support financially these types of programs we can bring the depot to the curb and how can we how can we get support from the pros to pay for that extra cost and make it available to all of our communities so that's that's where we're really hoping for in the long run and I think getting these programs in place positions as well to have an established process in place versus kind of building it from the ground with which it cost them to extract certain things like batteries it must be the haulers must be people throw a lot of stuff in the garbage as you know and so if there was some incentives to hauler I would think that maybe they could make a little but the haulers just take it to the transfer right and it's somebody else's problem yeah right right um there's very little checking and for the municipal trucks that come in on the wet sides uh like if they go to Metro South it's just a huge pit because they repurposed to the pit whereas if we go in as commercial dry side then they do have some staff that try to pick out of the pile that you dump onto the floor I have spent weight cleaning out houses and dealing with this stuff and and these products even compact fluorescent light bulbs and batteries are not illegal to throw in the garbage they are considered a small Trace amount of hazardous material and they're not banned from the landfill so throwing batteries in the garbage or you know household alkaline batteries is not against the rules per se I mean there's a better way to manage it and separating it and part of the battery program you might recall was fire prevention we have fires in trucks when batteries kind of connect and Spark and we got some earned media on this from resource recycling magazine the Oregon counties start battery recycling programs and there was a lot of interest about how easy it was because we had glass on the side and we just added a Ziploc bag to the glass bin and they asked the question from of us and our haulers did this prevent fires and it's hard to say well there wasn't any fire since then can we say it's just because the battery program not necessarily but let's hope that it prevented at least one fire so cool well I'm anxious for you to keep going because this is my second or third generation of multi-family housing proposals there you go yeah um so customer Community member feedback when we started this program we knew it was new we knew it was unique we knew we had a lot to learn we started out wanting feedback we wanted to we asked community members tell us how it's going give us information we want to use that information to learn we want to use that information to do better we received 172 instances of feedback from our community this is kind of beyond the you know filing a complaint with the our on our website this is giving us information and feedback um we categorize that information by the type of feedback we got we used inquiry complaint interest um a pickup request or a problem and this is kind of the the graph of what those complaints came in inquiries were definitely our number one feedback category we did have complaints and problems and those are the biggest opportunities for us to understand what's the problem and what's the challenge and see if we can adjust our practices to approve there um we are happy to see we looked at the data we bifurcated it we compared the first half of the program launched the second half of the program and we saw our complaints and problems go down pretty significantly there were a couple big things that showed up right in the beginning one of them was the quality of the type of bag delivered and the size of it and that was an easy opportunity for us to step in and say wait let's look at this closer this hauler is getting a lot of complaints this one's not let's go to the one that's not let's look at their bag Let's help them Source it at this point and that fixed a lot of problems we also got complaints about online options and having to call in the request to pick up and I need I just want to go to a website and click a button um and we're starting to incorporate more of that into with our franchisees we're actually going to be",

        "text": " um we had kind of the intent was to have covered those along with kind of the procedural um issues at the outset um where uh you know the recommendation was that there wasn't sufficient substantive information and in those exceptions to be able to allow the council to um to make an informed decision on those so that's why we ended up with nine and miss started weather nine nine and five bear with me as i kind of come out of the noise and let's go over um so the council's land use standard um requires the council to find that the proposed facility complies with the local applicable uh substantive criteria and statewide planning gold as as adopted by the lcdc or the land conservation and development applicable substantive criteria uh is from the affected uh are the criteria from the affected local governments acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use ordinances that are required by the state that are required by the statewide planning goals identified as applicable to a proposed based on based on the facility of type and the applicable substantive criteria the goal post in council's rules for preliminary application is submitted and so for land use for jurisdictions where the land use applies that was um 2013. the analysis area for land use is um a one-half mile from the site boundary and so that is the area that is oops looked at i wasn't ready for that um and then the because this is a long linear facility um we've talked about um the jurisdictions that it crosses it's five counties in oregon um it crosses malheur baker union umatilla and morrow county there's also some facility components in north powter and huntington oregon so those are all of the local governments must comply with the land use standard and so the land use section in the proposed order is very it's very long right um because criteria i'm going to go to the next slide here that's okay the table is kind of small but these are the criteria that are identified by the local governments um the applicant in its exhibit k also identifies criteria that is applicable to the facility i'm going to kind of just go through these pretty quickly my presentation is fairly short on land use just so we can go and and talk to the um the i don't know the the meteor stuff is the are the items that are related to the contested case issue so i'm kind of just doing a quick overview of of land use um and this is kind of the layout in the section there are lots of land use conditions and a lot of them are um i don't i'm kind of air quoting typical conditions that would apply to setbacks of certain um certain structures um same with compliance with local permits comprehensive uh conditional use permit submission under each county as per their um their so in um umatilla in union county as we can kind of see on the top of each slide i have a summary of the the zones that are crossed by the facility in umatilla in union county the facility does cross forest lands so under oar 6606 25 sub 4q it establishes that new electric transmission lines with right-of-ways with right-of-ways up to 100 feet are conditionally permissible uses within forest lands and we're kind of going back to that um going back to the actual um final right-of-way width of the facility um that is anticipated to be the 300 feet in forest lands and that is to ensure that there's enough vegetative clearance for hazard trees and this is um safety and fire uh part of the operation and maintenance of the transmission line so this is related to that right wider right of way in forest lands um the transmission line would satisfy oar 666 25 for sub-q however the permanent access roads that would be necessary to service the the transmission line in operation those would be located within the hundred foot right of way for which the structures are allowable so the applicant requested the council take an exception to the statewide policy embodied in goal 4 for the forest lands in umatilla and union counties and jesse will go over those more in more detail but that's just kind of the set up background for that portion um so this is this is in union county which has the same note about the forest lands and then baker county i think shout out to umatilla county over here hi guys and union oh scott left okay um all right so um and this is just a really high level um and that's that is basically my presentation unless council has any specific questions to the proposed order we can pass it off to jesse sorry for the record kellen i did have a couple conditions here i'll just leave them up here and this is kind of this relates um to the wider right-of-way in forest lands and then we're there's also the um right-of-way clearing assessment which talks about has that built-in agency consultation and this is the applicant's proposal for maintaining you know vegetative clearance in the in the utility right away let me make sure okay now i'm done sorry thanks so issue lu9 the limited party is myers the issue is whether the applicant adequately analyzed the risk of wildfires from the operation of the proposed transmission line especially during red flag warning weather conditions and the impact the proposed transmission lines will have on mr meyer's ability to use an aerial applicator on his farmland so in the hearing officer's proposed contested case order she first provided a definition of what a red flag warning it's a forecast warning issued by the national weather service to inform the public firefighters and land management that conditions are ideal for wildland fire combustion and rapid spread red flag warnings are often preceded by a fire weather watch which indicates weather conditions that could occur in the next 12 to 72 hours the national weather service has developed different zones across the nation for providing weather alerts such as red flag warnings to more discrete areas these zones are monitored and are factored into the applicant's determination of whether to initiate a public safety power shut uh so a little bit of background on on what that is so the hearing officer's opinion concluded that the risk of wildfire during red flag warning weather conditions was adequately evaluated in the 2022 wildfire mitigation plan which was submitted by the applicant during the contested case the potential fire risk zones along the proposed route were evaluated in that mitigation plan the hearing officer found that evidence on the record demonstrates that the distance between structures the height of structures and soil type result in low risk of the potential for large dust devils to interact with the transmission line and cause a fire based on review of the data regarding fire size and cause in the area which is morrow county the likelihood of a catastrophic project related wildfire during operation is very low therefore there is no need for the applicant to have a soil rehabilitation plan in place in response to potential fire related damage to agricultural soils on mr meyer's property hearing officer found that the applicant provided expert testimony that evaluated the fuel source on mr meyer's property including herbaceous grass and grain based on this fuel source any fire on or near mr meyer's property is expected to be low intensity and fast moving given wind conditions in this area low intensity fast-moving fires do not cause significant damage to hearing officer found that the applicant identified potential impacts to agricultural operations including accessibility to fields for aerial spraying specifically under the agricultural mitigation plan the applicant would be required to work with microsite the line siding the line along the edge of fields or existing rights-of-way and negotiate right-of-way easements finally the hearing officer concluded that ors 215 275 sub5 does not require that there be no impacts from the transmission line to agricultural operations the potential impacts to aerial spraying have been identified and evaluated and the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that the applicant will generally reduce the intensity and frequency of impacts to farmlands okay that again is the summary of the hearing officer's findings and conclusions with respect to this issue and we're ready for mr meyer's oral well the applicant adequately analyzed the risk of wildfires from operation and during red flag warnings i request that reverse the alj's decision specifically the alj was incorrect in finding that idaho power adequately analyzed the risk of project related wildfire during red flag warning weather warning conditions and an operation as well it's clear in the ipc's 2022 fire mitigation plan that they failed to include the zone that potential that poses a highest level of risk that zone is over our farm that's a weather service designated zone over our farm it's not a zone that you talked about prior to this and that groups weather issues that are similar issued by the weather service itself the ipc failed to include our zone as a fire zone risk or at risk zone they failed to include this it this zone includes our crop our farm and this zone also makes up 25 of the proposed transmission line length the ipc misclassifying this zone as a critical virus again this zone has the same number of red flag warnings issued on average as other zones that were classified as critical high critical fire risk zones in addition the alj was incorrect in finding that high winds pose little risk for wildfires caused by transmission line ignition in my supporting evidence i presented in multiple filings showing the 500 kv transmission lines have ignited fires in comparable landscapes idaho power has confirmed this fact furthermore the alj was incorrect in finding that if a fire were to occur on my farm it would have minimal soil impact and there's no need for the ipc to have a soil rehabilitation plan in quite frankly contrary to idaho power's expert witness mr madison the facts provided in my direct testimony are a hundred percent accurate and specifically unique to this cropping system as supporting evidence i provided a signed written testimony of a local farmer that experienced the fire in his crop land that fire impacted his soil negatively for over six years this is a well-documented testimony that completely contradicts mr madison's it is very clear that a much larger risk exists than what was assessed in essence the risk on our section of farm has not been addressed and certainly not as adequately judge webster was incorrect in finding i did not timely offer testimony from the article by zuhulin gu into the hearing record i presented this article within the filing deadline in my declaration testimony and it is critical evidence crucial evidence related to my issue should not be overlooked mr myers you need to wrap up by leaving out",

everybody who served I agree I think we is 162 veterans that are employed for Mar count3 163 I was looking at Salvador behind you okay 163 and yesterday I had the opportunity to do an interview with CCTV or Capital media I think is what it's called now to talk about the recruitment Fair that's coming next week and we talked about uh when you go to our website to apply to work for Maran County there's two buttons on our HR page there's the go search for your jobs and if you're a veteran go here and I think it's super important that we call that out and I think it's important also to acknowledge that we really take um the value seriously that we have for the veterans across Maran County but specifically when they want to work here and continue on the value and tradition of Public Service um and I I just I'm grateful for that so thank you everybody and you know we had an election yesterday and it just seems so appropriate that we're celebrating Veterans Day right after election day you know because there's a lot of places in the world where they don't have the opportunity to have free elections you know and so I I just think about um the sacrifice that our our service members make for us so that we can we can all vote and sometimes the vote turns out the way I want sometimes it doesn't but um if it will wasn't for the men women the Armed Forces protecting our freedoms we wouldn't we wouldn't even have the ability to do that and so it just seems very appropriate that today we're celebrating our veterans the day after an election seems very American to me agreed all right should we do our Proclamation here do you want to do we need a motion first so I move to approve a proclamation designating Maring County as a green light for veterans County excuse me and declaring November 6 2023 through November 12th 2023 as green lights for veterans week in Marian County and I will second that motion do a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying I I I I the motion passes in the matter of honoring veterans through operation Greenlight this matter came before the Maring County Board of Commissioners at its regularly scheduled public meeting on Wednesday November 8th 2023 whereas the people of Marian County Oregon hold deep respect and gratitude for the veterans who have selflessly served our nation and whereas more than 20,000 veterans and their families choose to make Maran County their home and whereas 163 veterans continue to serve their Community as employees of Maran County and whereas our veterans have demonstrated unwavering dedication courage and sacrifice in defense of our freedom and the principles upon our nation was founded and whereas the commitment of our veterans to uphold the values of Liberty democracy and Justice serves as an inspiration to all residents",

        "text": " which that combined is actually uh unit one and then sickle two which is the unit two each of the units has separate llc's limited liability corporations as the site certificate holder but both are owned by the same parent company nextera energy Resources LLC the event SQL unit which is the unit 2 is currently being repowered with new blades and the cells consistent with the council's approval of amendment number seven in July this year the amendment determination request proposes the Wind Facility components within the Van Sickle unit be reassigned from the current site certificate Builder which is FPL energy state line 2 Incorporated to then signal2 wind LLC without requiring an amendment because nextera energy Resources LLC which the parent company will continue to retain control of both of the units in this case the particularly event signal to unit so Oregon administrative rule requires that a site certificate Trend required a safe certificate transfer if there has been a change in ownership possession or control of the facility or the certificate holder reporting to the subscript holder and his parent company there will be no such change because while the assets will be assigned to a new LLC and the new LLC will become the certificate holder the parent company will retain ownership possession and control of the project and the certificate holder So based on a review of this rule the circumstances associated with the reassignment of the unit from one LLC to another and the written verification that nextera energy Resources LLC will continue to retain control of the encyclical unit the department agreed with the certificate holder and concluded on October 27 yesterday that an amendment was not required so this determination with sound via currency email through our click Dimensions email system okay you can sign up to receive that and it was also forwarded to council members yesterday so also importantly per our administrative rule 345 zero two seven zero three five seven sub six at the request of any member of the energy facilities fighting Council the Department's determination must be referred to the council for concurrence modification or rejection so just as a there are two types of two general types of amendment determination plus the type A type B the type A type B only the certificate holder can request that be brought to council if they disagree with the Department's determination so for this type it is essentially you know at the uh well certificate holder could do it as well but it's the uh if the council believes that they will remove you you know the determination of the department you may do that and so if you do want to have this brought up to the full Council please let us know within you know probably early next week and then we would add that to the November yes Cindy um thank you chair girl um Cindy Condon um so I got the email last night squared away and so I appreciate you um forwarding that I I guess I would like to look a little bit more injured or have the department look into it with respect to the you know once again we're uh considering the parent company as the ultimate responsibility but I don't see that in the you know does the security Interest come from the parent company or the LLC and so I'm somewhat unusing with that so I guess I might that patterns feel comfortable kind of responding to that the security instrument is going to be updated but it will name the new LLC team of the assets have been assigned but I haven't seen it but I know that that is in the works City plan and again and I guess in in my mind that it is the LLC not the parent that we should be relying on for their financial capability the financial statements for them do we have a comfort letter for the LLC not for the parent company I think of them as very different entities and I know I've mentioned that before so a solar country uh for record talk Hornet so just for playing that out uh not comfortable in would you like us to bring this to Council in November so that you can evaluate your career disagree uh with the determination or would you just like a little more information before you meet that would be a little bit more time to look at it um and I just didn't have time last night I wrote some more conversation sure um with respect to the what what are the uh aware of the jobs uh where are they connect and right now I just don't I see Dexter as the parent that's fine but if they're not doing this site certificate holder they're nowhere else in the mess really the result uh and just from a practical um so the November council meeting is the 17th and 18th um and so because that is earlier in the month because of the Thanksgiving holiday uh next Friday is the date deadline for the first round packets so um if you wanted to have this brought up to full Council uh I did say November um we we may be able to do that but it also may need to go to December because again we're on a shorter time frame uh for the next chance so again but that doesn't mean that you know you shouldn't uh request you know that evaluation but I just wanted to correct it so okay for the record this is Marcy so is it I I think I understand what Cindy's asking but is it even something like if you got to delegate Patrick but if there were something that you could identify answer what you're saying it may not be needed it also is that what we're looking at is that you're going to look and double check to make sure to be able to answer and maybe we're looking at a placeholder and if more information is needed then we'd say in December so everybody could do their full parts that yeah that's good um so I think before we don't need to do it on the record today but before um you know you leave today I think maybe we should have a conversation and I could write down like your specific questions so that we can then look into those and see if after we respond you're comfortable with then stats termination or if you're not in which case then we will put it on either the November or the December Council agenda does that mean yeah yeah thank you yeah I think that's sensible for the record this is Marcy and I I can't help remember to talk about it at these things seem to happen in this business and with all one on the world it's likely to continue to happen can at least get some parameters and understand up front now I'll say that's all later thank you thank you next on my list is the Nolan Hills project and specifically related to the contested case so following council's review of the Nolan Hills wind power project at its July council meeting the department issued the proposed order taking into account all comments that were submitted on the record of the draft post order during that time frame uh during the time frame to a request to participate in a contested case the council appointed hearing officer received such a request from Umatilla County who did not agree with the conclusion in the proposed order related to new Attila County's two-mile setback requirement between wind turbines and Residences essentially the determination was that it was not applicable substance criteria because it was not required by the language goals but they disagreed with that and that's essentially what their request to participate in a contested cases about so I can recall in the applicant's application they asserted that the setback requirement was not a political substance criteria So based upon the applicant's assertion the department evaluated that came to the same conclusion agreed with them in the draft proposed order and then during the DPO hearing Council also agreed with that on the record are they you know this is Hannah are they the only yes for the party yeah David McCartney um so that's the that's the nature of the contested case and then on October 14th the uh Council appointing hearing officer King Triana provided a status update email to um I forwarded that email to Council on that same day the 14th uh in summary the email stated that she anticipates providing written updates to the Council on this matter honor about the 15th of each month uh through the course of the contestant case proceeding or on an as needed basis and then on September 12th she issued the notice of petitions to request the party status the order scheduling and pre-hearing Conference and pre-rehearing conference agenda then October on October 5th 2022 the petitioner you mentioned the county the applicant and the Oregon Department of energy all through legal counsel participated in a telephonic free hearing conference regarding the petition on party status and she will be issuing an order on that petition for party status uh and and the contested case issues as soon as practically we think that's maybe the next step is yeah the order on she didn't State and win okay I would think we'd see it even before December okay yeah first let's say these are the parties these are the issues then we'll have a pre-hearing conference uh to talk about just how the contests saw proceed and eventually that will result in case so we'll keep Council up to date or she will keep Council up to date through us on the status of the investigation my recollection is that when we did the contested case on b2h we had got limited parties came we had to agree to the limited so will that Will Herb worker come back to us for approval possibly uh I believe that was because people were challenging right and so whether or not their issue was included or whether they were limited parties or not so that was raised so um similarly you know depending upon her determination even until the county would uh bring that to council if they but uh it's more likely we're just gonna agree it's probably you know I don't want to presuppose anything but because it's really one issue one party um it's probably not nearly the the complexity that department having by right so it's possible but I would say a lot less likely I I would agree that there's they actually raised two issues the other issue that they raised was uh the they had commented on the DPO that Council should require the applicant to get a contingent conditional use permit in the proposed order the department did include a requirement saying you have to get a cup from the county uh during the pre-sering conference the County's attorney uh stated that they interpret the requirement to get a cup product differently than how we interpret it which is the cup would include the setback requirements so it's if you however the hearing officer results the first issue should take care of that second",

        "text": " Knuckleheads thinking back in 2023 so what Comfort can you give well commissioner Rogers thank you for the question and well I appreciate the compliment of being a knucklehead because that is an uplift from what I usually get but I I feel uniquely sitting here with that great question we have our finance director sitting over my shoulder to the right who is also constantly reminding us of the importance and need to close this out I think back to Hillsboro's history and partnership with Washington County and the Ron are acres Urban rural District which Suzanne will keep me honest on this I believe we closed out after 15 years 17 years maybe I'll see she's see there she goes 15 years I think is what I heard um but uh but we absolutely as I mentioned earlier in the presentation have a desire to close us out Ronler Acres closed out well ahead of the forecasted full year in part because our community was able to demonstrate great success in seeing the tax income and grow completing the multitude of projects up in that area which included things like Brookwood Parkway Evergreen Road and some other pieces and so we like the county have a shared interest in not keeping this tied up forever we have very clear goals of the infrastructure that's need in this area the sites that we want to Market into what Target users and that really is where the commitment is there we believe the actions are there in terms of how we have been steadfast and focused on growing the tax increment advancing the projects seeking to close it out albeit with this expansion to round out that and then lastly is again I just come back to the shared interest piece we have for us keeping that infrastructure or that tax base tied up we want to restore that back to our general fund too much like the other affected taxing districts want to see as well so I'll just reiterate from earlier in the presentation our goal is to maximize the yield in this area try to do it as thoughtfully and as quickly and efficiently as both we can do and as the market will respond to which that's probably the biggest unknown factor why I can't sit here and guarantee you a date today although recent news that's been out and about even over the last you know couple of days maybe is a positive near term uh precursor of that um but that's about as best I can give you I cannot commit to a date we also took this step in that same Spirit of not further extending that 25-year period with this expansion we are keeping the original 25 so we basically have about 18 19 years left in the district so we hope that those overtures and those actions are received positively in response to your question and into the board of County Commissioner's consideration this project comment back and I'll give you my YouTube comments one my comment back is I appreciate that I'm just hoping that that gets memorialized in all the conversations because that's what people are going to look back at and say well what were they thinking what was said and so I'm raising the question that you memorialize that by saying it is our in full intent and so on in whatever that is 251 I guess or 50. yeah you're going to uh have somebody read it and say but that's what you said my other two comments are I you did one of the better jobs I've seen in regard to the school district because quite frankly giving them a lot more money doesn't help them as we all know because they're a part of the state basic school report so if they get more money uh what happens they have to report that and then they stay basic I think it goes down so it's kind of a net some you did a good job yeah I think one of the better jobs I think and my last comment is that one of the things that's very difficult from this table and others to see is if nothing happened what would be the assessed value versus what you're going to bring and that's one of the things I used to tell people many years ago take a look at what your stars and your face is is that what you want in the year 209 by 750 is none of that it's going to be 47 46 48 whatever it comes out what would that look like in terms of taxes versus what you're bringing to the table because nobody ever quantifies that you kind of do but when people see that they say wow that's an opportunity costs that were you know if we're going now but we're going to get this big egg in the future and nobody ever looks at that they just say well I'm giving up all these taxes this is terrible you never would have a taxes correct if the Improvement wasn't done you and I know that but it'd be nice if there was some commentary about that we appreciate that if I may just respond to that last comment um we have seen a bit of the you know I engagement from colleagues sometimes about this but for argument and into what you're saying is with this investment in what would be the timing of the investment in the tax-based growth without this in our North Hillsborough area and in this technology park there was about 12 years from roughly 2006 to about 2000 um 17 2016-17 when we started to really adopt and implement this tool where we did not see we saw very marginal uh investment in expansion the area in part because the cost of extending infrastructure and the proximity to existing infrastructure drove so much of that so well-suited sites that were a quarter a mile or a half a mile away from existing water lines or service areas if you had intervening property owners that either weren't accessible weren't willing to sell whatever the case might be the market by itself was not fully responding there and also with the highest and best uses in our Target industries that we also are seeking in this area what we why we wanted to show the Drone video primarily is to show that when we are able to collectively align on our plans and our policy objectives and that changed that one property owner who's three Parcels in is no longer contingent upon their two neighbors they can become more development ready and in turn the market can come in and respond that much sooner getting us back to closing out the district also that much quicker and so we have seen that both anecdotally and then back to the point about what would be the foregone Revenue that's exactly why I wanted to call the attention and a bit of that caveat to that column three because those are there's a few commas in that number which are big numbers but right now and our staff were just running this time of their day so Val's Gonna Keep Me honest but I believe the total tax revenue collected out of that area the expansion error that we're talking about is forty four thousand dollars primarily because of farm and Forest referral and a lot of it being there's very little very few improvements in that area and so that's really where on that that table side that I showed when you see 234 assessed value growth some of that is because it's already a very low basis of which we're also freezing with this urban renewal plan but also with our investments and with that realization of the capital expenditures of the nature facilities we have like high-tech users with a lot of personal equipment in there that's where we see that rapid escalation to grow okay we have about 15 minutes uh for the four of us to have some remaining q a Time who's next well I'm just going to comment that um you know I was around when we initiated um with a plan of raising 105 or 110 million dollars I believe for the infrastructure to develop that North Hillsboro Park and it's been wildly successful obviously and so um that's exactly what we use these plans for and and certainly it's amazing to see what the increase in the assessed value and those things so when we do come back on the rules it's going to be a significant Improvement in enhancement to our taxes um as far as your area of expansion and this will be my only question the area of expansion looks like it goes to the western side to Sewell is that is that where you are uh Nick won just before that oh yeah I can see that one better yeah but maybe that the other one explains it better but so is that the maximum amount that you could bring in I heard you say we had limitations I believe the maximum amount in this District we could bring it would be close to about 220 Acres so we are not at the maximum Geographic footprint we're close to it but under it a bit the boundaries for reference and I apologize again to those of you with the need multiple laser pointers here I suppose but so Sewell Avenue goes here and so Sewell is the eastern boundary here's Meek Road in Highway 26. this is the North Fork of wible Creek I believe uh comes through and that this heavier dotted line is the current Urban growth and so we are going to the edge of that Urban growth boundary uh and north of the Creek West of Sewell Avenue if that helps answer your question commission oh if and just west of that is where we're talking about 500 Acres for the semiconductor information or is it this area in here yeah that's right so that would come in would you would you be able to expand and see where you were pointing yeah yeah so uh commissioner Willie yeah so let me try to answer both parts of this so the the yellow area is fully inside our Urban growth boundary fully within Hillsboro's area of planning responsibility and coordination with the county and that's why we do believe that this action is needed with or without any additional considerations I think what you're referring to is the recently passed Senate Bill 4 which gives the governor uh executive authority to bring additional lands into ugbs for certain industrial and especially semiconductor related purposes so the answer to your second question of would this help that it absolutely would give Washington County and City of Hillsboro a next logical linkage and we would already be abutting an area that could potentially be considered that area is eligible per sb4 is the city's um but back to the decision that's before you we are bringing this forward really we started it absent s before and we believe that is an important policy decision to make with or without as before if an sb4 decision were made and if lands to the west of this area were included",

        "text": " The Deniland Police Department is going to do its part up to the city limits starting now with its five man force. Very good. So I'm impressed by that. Thank you very much, Mister White. Do we have anyone else in the audience who would like to address the commission? If so, I invite you to come to the podium now. Morning, my name is Joseph Walker. I live at 18820 Southeast 54th place. Oklahoma, Florida 32179. I'm talking about cold enforcement today on here. I got a map in here I want you to take a look at. Can you put that up? Okay, you've seen the map there. We got. I made five complaints on that on Friday. And we have a problem with they go going to code enforcement. I bring in the partial numbers, show them where it's at and stuff. They have a hard time getting it right. I said five went out to the town, five orders went out there on it. And one was regarding a stop sign on the corner of the property up there on it. And they have also 711 sign there. So then she thought I meant the 711 sign rather than the one that was on below. The thing there says junk cars want it. They hung it right on the stop sign. That's what we got on that one. Now another problem is code enforcement. We go in there for meetings, you know, on their code enforcement board, they don't have anything like this here to pull up. Why don't we have some funds put in there, get it, so we can pull something like this up. When a person walks in there and says, well, what's wrong with my property? You can show them in here what you took a picture of and done it, took care of it. Do we have funds for this or don't we? We can give away money when we come along here with them. We get fines on them and then we just drop the fees on it. But we don't improve our code enforcement. So I would like to have them inform, improve their cameras and other stuff over there so we have these meetings in here, so we don't spend hours trying to get something, you know, problems with this here on it. We need to have it be because most of the meetings that when you go to the meetings, most of them are there over there. The board is over junk and on a unit, unserviceable vehicles not running. We need to have this type of something here so we can show that people what they have a violation of and what it is. And also we get the code enforcement board to come up forward with here and they can see this stuff here. And also our inspectors know what they're talking about because you get, you go run through there, you got 50 of them, you go through there on it. And how you're supposed to remember each one of these is supposed to remember it on it. So I appreciate if you can come up with some funds to help improve our technology and stuff over there at code enforcement. Thank you Mister Walker. You're welcome. Is there anyone else in the audience who would like to address the board today? If not, I will close this. Oh, I'm sorry. Mister Munoz, if there's anyone behind Mister Munoz, I invite you to come to the second podium while he speaking. Okay. Henry Munoz, 495 Marion Oaks Boulevard. Yesterday afternoon, in my effort to stay out of trouble, I was over at Sumter county and they're planning to put solar panels on the south, on the south border of Marion Oaks. Our biggest concern for me right now is that they don't use our roads to connect to that property because they're not going to fix it. They'll mess it up and leave us to fix the mess. Okay. A lot of the neighbors that live there already feeling the suffering because they've already started cutting down trees and so forth. And they're having troubles with the noise and also the light. Since the trees are cutting down, there's more light coming in. And so I'm hoping that we keep a track of this. I plan to give this to Miss Bryant so she can see what we can do to make sure that they don't violate us. Taking care of Duke Energy's proposal over there. Thank you, Mister Minos. It's in the duke. Right away. I don't think he heard you. Okay. Okay. Is there anyone else in the audience who would like to address the board during this open public comment? If not, then I will bring it back to commissioner. Items for commissioner comments Commissioner Curry? Commissioner Zalick, just, just the. We did the proclamation this morning. So thank you commissioners for the national day of prayer, May 2. We're excited about the continue to have some folks there and use the veterans park. I believe we had a meeting on that this next week and so thank you commissioners, and looking forward to seeing that come to fruition again. Absolutely. It's a beautiful time and I'm so happy that we're able to participate with that. Commissioner Bryant. Good. I'm hungry. Okay. I would just ask my ribbon for the run for the springs come up. That ribbon. I like it. That will be this Saturday at Kearney Island. 730 for runners, walkers, people who just want to come and cheer us on. So next Saturday. Next Saturday, excuse me, on the 27th, all my Saturdays are booked so. Excuse me, it's the 27th, so you still have time to get a little training in for the 27th. And I do encourage you to participate. And at this point in time we are. Well, I'm sorry, I have one more. And that is Florida Gambler 500 had a phone call from a gentleman who is associated with the Florida Gambler 500. They have done a yeoman's job by collecting tons and tons of waste out of our forest. And I just want to give a shout out to our department and waste management department over there by working with them. And they had 300 volunteers. They don't have their totals in just yet, but 7500 pounds of trash were disposed of and a grand total of 50 tons of trash were removed from public lands in the last six years. And they were still waiting to find out how much they had brought in this past weekend. So again, a big shout out to the Florida gambler 500 group. I did ask them if they would like to come and be recognized and they said no. But since we are going into this upcoming week, I think it's important that we acknowledge them. So, with that, we are going to be in recess until 02:00 p.m. and we will also be back at 150 for our CRA meeting. So thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the planning and zoning and DRC waiver request portion of our meeting today. If you would please stand with me for the pledge of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, everyone. And Madam Clerk, if you could please call roll Chairman Stone. Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Here. Commissioner Curry? Here. Commissioner McLean? Here. Commissioner Zalig. Very good. And proof of publication. I have proof of publication of legal ad number 100-5471 entitled notice of intention to consider adoption of an ordinance published in the Star Banner newspaper on April 1, 2024. Very good. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if this is your first time with us, I'll ask if you'll please mute your cell phones. If you need to have any sort of a conversation with someone sitting next to you or with anyone outside of this auditorium, if you will please take it outside of this auditorium. There is wonderful acoustics from your side. It drifts all the way down here. And the goal is to make sure that our clerk is able to hear all of the proceedings and capture them. So we do not want to disrupt any of those proceedings. And with that, I'm going to ask Mister Minter to give us an introduction for how the rest of this meeting is going to flow. Madam chair. Good afternoon, everybody. So, we've got one DRC development review committee waiver request regarding safety permit water connection. For that, we've got 510 items that will be read off. Excuse me, mister Mentor, could you just turn on your microphone, please? You may need to start again. Thought it was on. I apologize. I could hear you. Okay. Anyway, we have five consent items for zoning and planning. Those items are matters as to which before today, we have not received any objections. If, however, you are here today and you have either a question or an objection for any one of the five consent items, when that number is read off, raise your hand and we will pull it off of the consent item and it will be heard individually. Otherwise, all five of the consent items will be approved by the board with a single motion. So, if you are here as the applicant for one of the consent items, and the board makes that motion to approve all the consent items, then you have received your approval and you don't have to stay around for the rest of the meeting. Then we go into the three items for individual consideration. That consists of one application for a special use permit and two rezoning applications. All three of these items are considered to be quasi judicial matters. That means the board is acting basically in a judicial capacity, like a judge. Their decision has to be based on competent and substantial evidence. I'll be asking any of you who are going to testify regarding any of these items",

        "text": " ordin 899 and we will start with a staff so good evening chlock wood PC members I'm Todd borkwood senior planner with land juice and transportation thank you um today we'll be reviewing ordinance number 899 the proposed expansion of the North Plains Urban boundary here's an outline line for tonight for tonight's presentation uh I'll provide a brief overview of the North Plains ugb expansion process highlight the policy framework that prescribes what cities and counties must consider for ugb expansions outside of Metro uh describe ordinance 899 recommended provisions and share the staff recommended the St staff recommendation on ordinance number 899 so I want to stress that the County's role in ugb expansions for cities like North plains that are outside of the Metro uh ugb is very limited the county and City must each approve the ugb expansions for an ordinance before the expansion can be approved by the state of of Oregon this is different from the Metro EB expansion process on that let's move on to the slide here's a map of North Plains and its location in the county North Plains has a population of three 3,441 people the city limits of North Plains and the North Plains ugb are nearly exact comprising about 700 Acres like Banks Caston like Banks and Gaston uh North Plains has its own ugb that is distinct from the Metro ugb ug ugb expansion in North plains like those for the other two cities are governed by state rules and not by Metro uh here's an overview of the process for North plain ugb expansion organ law requires cities to plan for 20 years of Housing and employment growth this is explicitly stated in Statewide planning goal 14 the goal that's the foundation of eug expansions in Oregon cities must accommodate the 20-year growth forecast within the existing ugb when that forecasted growth cannot be accommodated within the existing ugb cities can follow a state defined process for ugb expansion that requires the city to meet detailed criteria provided in State Statute and rules North Plains followed the state defined process Washington County and agency partners collaborated with the city on this process when once this analysis process is complete and the ugb expansion is proposed state law requires that both the city and the county approve the proposed expansion through ordinance North PL city council adopted its ugb expansion ordinance earlier this year tonight is the first public hearing for the County ordinance a legislative process that is similar to but distinct from the city's legislative process so here's the proposed North PL ggb expansion area it's shaded in dark gray it's approximately 850 55 Acres over double the 700 Acres uh in the current North Plains ugb the proposed ugb expansion is primarily north of us26 uh and to the east and west of the current city limits it also includes 34 Acres south of us26 and south of the current U current North Plains ugb here is policy framework for North plain GB expansion it includes uh it includes uh State policy most notably Statewide planning go 14 urbanization and other Statewide planning goals and state statutes and administrative rules containing the criteria for ugb expansions outside of Metro North PL ugb expansion is also codified in policies within the County's comprehensive plan elements including those listed here at the bottom as I indicated earlier Statewide planning goal 14 um uh is a goal that forms a foundation for ugb expansions in Oregon its attent is to provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to Urban land use to accommodate Urban population and urban employment inside Urban growth boundaries to ensure efficient use of land and to provide for communities the goal includes the first state criteria North Plains considered for ugb expansion the city cooperated with agency partners like Washington County and identified a 20-year land need for employment and residential North PL has been discussing egb expansion for much of the past decade and in 2019 notified County staff of its interest in youb expansion in accordance with requirements in go1 14 and the Washington County North Plains urban planning area agreement in eight meetings over the past four years County staff collaborated with North Plains and other partners um on the project on the uh ugb Expansion Project advisory committee the county coordinated with North Plaines and the department of land conservation and development or dlcd to ensure planning processes and actions of the city and county align for the next go 14 requirement North Plains demonstrated its land need to accommodate a 20-year Urban population forecast the population estimate by Portland State University's population Research Center focused a city population of 7,076 people in 2040 an increase of 3,666 people and an average growth rate 3.7% in response the city updated its economic opportunities analysis and housing needs analysis documents that the state requires a city maintain to demonstrate future housing and employment land needs the city also adopted land use efficiency measures to determine how much of this land could be accommodated within the city's existing Urban growth these three analyses the economic opportunities analysis the housing needs analysis and the land use efficiency measures together inform formed the size of the proposed North Plains ugb expansion and were the basis for the city's uh North Plains Urban growth boundary expansion report the city's economic opportunities analysis identified a need for 687.5rpm 72.4 acres for commercial uses and 55.4 acres for industrial uses while some testimony has questioned the state's process the city followed to determine these numbers the economic opportunities analysis is now State acknowledged is now a state acknowledged document that cannot be appealed the city's updated housing needs analysis identified a need for 1,348 dwelling units over the next 20 years the city determined 5 58 units could be accommodated within the existing UCB and 79 790 could only be accommodated through UCB expansion to accommodate these dwelling units and the parks trails open space in schools and public infrastructure needed to serve them the city determined that 167.5 Acres of residential land was needed combined the city identified a need for an additional 8552 acres of land to meet its housing and employment needs for the next 20 years and I realized I threw out a bunch of numbers that weren't on the on the um on the slide in front of you uh those numbers are included in the staff report for for this ordinance so organ administrative rules specifically o 60-24 d65 includes the next St criteria for North plains that North pl's considered for egb expansion the state requires North Plains to establish a study area to evaluate and prioritize land for inclusion in the tgb it also allows the process for exclusion of certain lands from the study area for cities like North Plains with a population less than 10,000 the preliminary study area must include all lands in the cities acknowledged Urban Reserve if any all lands within half mile from the ugb and all exception lands within one mile from the ugb I'll explain these terms a little bit more in the coming slides so rural lands in counties in the Metro region fall into one of three types Urban reserves shown in blue are lands generally adjacent to the Metro Urban growth boundary rural reserves shown in green are generally off limits for youb expansion in the near future undesignated lands lands that are neither Urban or rural Reserve are the only types of land available for ugb expansion and cities outside of the as shown here North Plains has no undes undesignated I'm sorry as shown here North Plains has no designated Urban reserves and cannot expand its ugb into the rural reserves again the rural reserves are shown here in green undesignated land shown here in the light gray is the only land that North Plains can expand into while undesignated land is not further defined in State Statute rules or planning documents that guide the reserves process the State's Department of of land conservation and development confirmed that the undesignated land regardless of the quality of farm land it contains can be used by cities like North Plains for ugb expansion North Plains included all the undesignated land within its preliminary study area for ugb expansion but identified an exclusion area that met state to find criteria for exclusion the city proposed to exclude a majority of the exception land most of the area south of us26 exception lands are rural lands outside of ugbs designated for nonforest and non-agricultural uses and that have been made unsuitable for farming or forestry over time by surrounding development North Plains ex North Plaines excluded the hatched area shown in this map from the preliminary study area that is generally bounded by us 26 uh 316th place and Beach and Gordon roads this was primarily due to restrictive covenants into two residential subdivisions surrounding the Sun at air strip resulting in a significant impediment to development at intensities o 66024 d67 prescribes the priority of study land lands that cities like North PLS must consider when seeking to expand the ugb land must be considered for inclusion in the ugb following in the following order of Priority Priority One is urban reserves Urban Reser areas exception lands and non-resource land and non-resource land is generally land that is not designated af20 EFC or efu priority two is marginal lands as defined in State Statute priority three is farm and force land that is not P predominantly high value farmland or does not consist of predominantly prime or unique soils then lastly priority for is agricultural land that is PRI predominantly high value farmland um cities may not select uh land that is predominantly made up of uh that is in priority for land that is predominantly made up of primary unique um Farm soils unless there is insufficient amount of other land to satisfy this land need so for Priority One lands as I mentioned already the study area did not contain any Urban Reserve lands it did however contain approximately 42 Acres of exception land and non-resource lands including most of the south portion of the study area below us 26 only 34 Acres however are available for are available for inclusion in the ugb due to the exclusion of the sunset airstrip and the residential subdivision surrounding it moving on to Priority two the study area had no marginal land then to Priority three the study area had no predominantly low value Farmland the remainder of the available land for ugb expansion therefore is predominantly high value Farmland containing prime or unique soils and here's a map that shows that uh the city of North Plains uh concluded that there was",

        "text": " just described her if anyone in the room wishes to do so please complete a card indicating so during this time I do not see any thank you all right so we have a call interview services hello council members this is Max yaclik in-house counsel for Nissan energy and I just wanted to add a little bit of the developers perspective to the conversation that was just had and we've been participating in that policy work group with orianna and everyone and are very thankful for all the work that has been done there but just in response to uh director cornett's comment about looking at the the amount of energy that's been um applied for at f-sec um Mike McArthur mentioned that the projected need to build meet h321 is is somewhere approaching approaching 50 gigawatts so you know the 2.5 gigawatts that have been currently approved is is far below what what we need and I just also want to reiterate that as we're looking at that element that we also need to consider the projects that are approved versus what actually ends up getting built due to constrict constraints like car purchase agreements so that's all I had to add and thank you so much for coming for convening and giving um orianna and the group an opportunity to talk about that process thank you for your comments do you see anyone else Nancy wishing to well we are going to close the public comment period at 9 38 or excuse me 10 so next up we have the Westin solar project this is Council review of the draft proposed order this is an information item we have Helen party weather senior citing analyst ready to present to us look at all cheery and bright for the holiday season just bear with me here how embarrassing good morning uh chair Grail members of the council for the record my name is Kellen tardy weather senior citing Analyst at Oregon Department of energy I've been here for oh over six years or something and I'm I missed um our our Hanley send-off but I just want to start unrelated to this agenda item um for um council member Jenkins thank you so much for all of your service um and help to Odo staff um and to the state of Oregon but also to other council members in your tenure here I know that you have um given us rigorous feedback on our materials and you help push us to do better and as well as teach new and ongoing council members the scope of council jurisdiction and standards and your understanding of the fset process is going to be um really missed as well it's just your presence on the capsule so thank you stay in touch and thanks um so let's see um did the record part oh that's well and good uh today I'm going to be uh today is uh council's review of the draft proposed order I'll kind of go over what led us to here but just last month we were out in Hermiston all together so I think that it's all pretty fresh in our minds of how we got here but I will um uh I will remind us of that um in the room here behind me we do have Rob Kula um flew fresh in out of Southern California and then um they're Representatives we have uh Sarah Stover Curtis came in from Portland so they are here today um which thank them for being here to represent their project um so I'm going to move forward maybe okay and then I'm I'm also I'm running the PowerPoint because as need be I have other materials pulled up so I may leave the PowerPoint to go look at say the applicant um responses to DPO comments Etc so that's um I'll be ready to do that today so bear with me as I'll I'll lose track of my notes and you know we'll just get through it together um so the presentation overview today is I'm gonna do an overview of of the facility on which Council also received last month I'll do a quick overview of the procedural history of how we got here and how long it took and then I'm going to go through each of the council standard standards and go over some select facts and select conditions recommended conditions of approval I'm certainly not going to go over all of them so if Council has any facts or conditions or findings that they want to touch on that maybe aren't in my presentation or the staff report we can totally go over those um and then I'm also going to go over the issues raised in the DPO comments from from the applicant reviewing agencies and council's comments and since we've had this time in between the last council meeting the Department's actually prepared to talk about recommendations that would for the proposed order um which sometimes you know we can do uh we can do it at a pretty high level too to get direction about what we want to see or what council would like to see in the proposed order on how to address so this I kind of just went over this that's what we're going to do today um I do want to comment that the record is close right so that's why we had Council provide comments while the record was still open because even though this is consistent with the council's rules it does raise this Awkward Moment of that really where council's first time of of seeing and commenting on on an application for site certificate or a draft proposed order the record may have already been closed so um so I just do want to to make note of that um and and then after uh after Council reviews the draft proposed order today the Department's going to issue the proposed order when we issue the proposed order we also issue notice of a contested case um this is for a new application for site certificate it's going to be an automatic contested case um if there's no petitioners that submit a petition the hearing officer will basically open and close it and it'll be done but it is automatic this is compared to an amendment if there is an um there are is a different threshold for the contested case and any petitioners have to request on Council for There's an opportunity to request a contested case based on a different to get into the contested case so the applicant here it's a subsidy buildings uh solar the proposed facility we're talking about is a 50 megawatt facility on 324 Acres so as we kind of knowed this is as compared to what council's used to seeing this is kind of a small facility and we went through the discussion of well why this is actually um the the acreage threshold for some of the facilities for Council but it goes into the definitions of what is considered high value farmland and this um basically gets under council's jurisdictions because it's in the ABA um nevertheless we're here also want to note that this um because it's this facility is uh below 100 megawatts that the applicant requested and this is being processed under the council's expedited review rules which are largely the same except an omitted kind of scoping notice of intent phase in the so uh the solar facility is a it includes solar modules and Associated equipment for the solar generating um this includes um about uh approximately 25 or a maximum of 25 inverters and 25 step up Transformers um and the related or supporting facilities I'll touch on the next slide um of notes is this facility does not act does not um include a proposal for a transmission line their proposal includes a connection to one of three existing transmission lines to the cross over the site and one that is a UEC Umatilla Electric Cooperative transmission line that runs on that on the road on Edwards Road which is just directly east of the facility site so related or supporting facilities and this is a little a little small and hard to read um but but this is a revised figure provided by the applicant so in here um the applicant proposes uh battery storage which would be a maximum of a 200 battery storage units I'll talk about this later in noise this is an interesting place where really the total amount of units of battery storage May um and the applicants proposing two potential layouts for those battery storage uh units um the applicants proposing a substation as well as a switching station the switching station would be where the interconnection with one of the existing transmission lines would happen or occur uh you can see here that they there is a setback avoidance area um along the existing transmission line corridors functionally the applicant's requesting that the site boundary be the micrositing corridor so facility components could basically be moved around anywhere in that area um related to supporting facilities also include interior access roads and then there's an access driveway off of Edwards um that's also included along with um Gates and construction staging areas but the applicant is representing that functionally the whole set be treated as a permanent impact here's our procedural history of how we got here on this Blissful Journey um and I'm just we kind of I went through this last time I'm going to focus here um so in November we had the hearing on the DPO and in response to council comments the applicant requested to leave the record open for an opportunity to them to respond to those comments and requested a deadline of December 2nd which the hearing officer granted um and to which on that date they did submit a supplemental response to DPO comments which leaves us here um on December 16th for the council's review of the DPO so on that note you know Council has because of kind of the duration of this period oftentimes Council may just receive one staff report of here's an overview of the DPO and the comments received thus far but because we've kind of like been never a little bit longer Council has received three staff reports so one was in preparation of the council meeting last month which went through each of our standards with select facts and those conditions and then we sent one on uh on December 2nd I believe which was an overview of uh comments including the applicant's comments and Department recommendations for how those should be responded to in the proposed order in that staff report and then on December 9 we provided an additional staff report that focused primarily on that on the applicants supplemental uh responses to the DPO comments um and so we're gonna touch on all of those today to try to to button that up button it up okay uh we're gonna start with the Castle's general standard of review the most interesting standard I think I think when we get when Council gets to a uh final decision on this project I I always think that this",

attachments A and B as well as the board priorities and principles as attachment C uh before I uh uh provide a recommendation I'd ask our CFM team to please come forward uh CFM Advocates are our legislative Advocates at both the federal and state level and we have representatives of both groups here tonight to present uh the Federal and State Legislative agenda uh so we'll start uh first with uh Kirby Garrett from the CFM Federal team who's here virtually hell there all right let me go ahead and share my screen here okay can everyone see that okay yes yeah okay perfect um all right well good evening it's great to see everybody virtually I wish I could be there in person I actually had the opportunity to be back in Salem last week um to try to visit with Allen but it was uh poorly timed poorly timed my travels um in hindsight with the ice storm so um I just yeah a second you know what everyone was talking about to begin this meeting I commend um chariots as a whole and uh navigating that storm and um making tough choices and uh providing service and getting that up and running as soon as possible because that was um that was an ny storm and not fun to navigate myself so um anyways it is a pleasure to be with you virtually again as Allan said my name is Kirby Garrett I am a federal Affairs partner here with CFM Advocates based out of our uh Washington DC office and as Alan said it's my pleasure to present to you our 2024 federal legislative agenda that we've put together with your team and we'll be working on your behalf to implement this year um so just oops uh before I dive in I'll just give a quick overview of um what I'll be talking about wanted to provide a quick recap of our successes over the past year and and even for that as well I'll just give you kind of a some context of where we stand on on some of our projects then we'll uh shift gears talk about the 2024 Federal agenda and your funding requests and policy priorities and then lastly I'll wrap things up with a quick uh legislative preview of what uh is sure to be and has already been a very interesting year um in Washington um all right so this is a slide uh always look forward to presenting um we are very very proud of the success that we have been able to achieve working together with you all um and this is a true Testament to your leadership as a board your uh staff's ability to put together uh just very high quality projects that really reflect the needs of your community and together working with us strong applications and a strong strong advocacy to secure funding for some of these items so uh won't go into each and every one of these but just to highlight a few um at the top there recap 2023 last year so we were able to secure uh a low and no emissions Grant award from the Federal Transit Administration for $6.6 million for U five additional battery electric buses um super exciting we we've just had a lot of success um going after those um buses in the past few years and taking advant of historic Investments here at the federal level we also were able to secure $500,000 through the congressionally directed spending process formerly known as earmarks these are uh congressionally directed awards that members of Congress are able to advocate for and try to include an annual Appropriations legislation so again we were able to secure 500,000 for the South Salem Mobility as a service Transit facility and we are uh so this is less than we requested obviously um but given what a haircut uh most Awards took on the house side we were uh still very excited to achieve this award especially um because we were able to secure an award last year as well in the FY 2023 appropriation cycle I will caveat things by saying that that 500,000 is still dependent on Congress fulfilling its basic legislative duty of funding the government each year I'll get into that in a little bit but they are still navigating that process and trying to figure out a way to finalize an appropriation spill but um I would be remissed if I didn't mention the hard work of our Congressional Delegation Senator Merkley Senator weiden and especially for this specific award um congresswoman Andrea Selenas who really uh led the effort to to get this in The house's uh proposal so um again won't go into each and every one of these additional Awards but you can see the list list there going back to 2018 we've been able to secure $29.5 million in federal grants and congressionally directed spending awards that is at least one award per year over the past uh six consecutive years so that is uh that's a record that again we are just super excited about and you know we've been testment that you're making in our services you can see there uh 60 60 to1 for every $1 you've been investing in our our service at the federal level we've been able to go out and secure about $60 in federal funding um back there to to Sal them so now turning to the 2024 Federal agenda very excited to work off of our success that we had last year and and in recent years we're really excited about the agenda we've outlined I think we've got some really high quality projects and and uh policy priorities to go out and pursue as Allan mentioned every year we put together this agenda as you can see not only outlines the projects that we're pursuing Federal funding for but also your policy priorities as well that we'll be advocating um for through the Congressional Appropriations process um and and any other policies that are moving forward at the federal level uh so first one South Salem uh Transit facility we know that's a huge priority of of you all and a fantastic project that really is going to make an impact there again we've been able to secure funding for kind of the preconstruction side and now we know it's time to to really get the you know the big check for actually constructing this and getting this done so we think that project is in a really really good spot we've had Success Through congressionally directed spending where we plan to pursue this again it's hard to get back-to-back Awards um in general especially for the same project but again this is a very compelling one um but we also think we've got a good case to make through the uh more traditional bus and bus facility grant program so we'll be working with your team again to put forward an application for that project I think you know how far you all have moved that project forward on the preconstruction side will really help um FDA likes to see projects that are you know have a high project Readiness score and our you know sort of uh shovel ready so to speak so we're excited to give that one another go um zero emission buses will continue pressing for this as well likely through congressionally directed spending as well the low and no emissions grant program through FTA and then security enhancements is kind of a new one that we've added this year where we are looking at likely a multi-pronged approach when Allen was out in Washington DC in December we have the opportunity to uh meet with FEMA and uh TSA to sort of explore this program it's something that uh uh chariots is not eligible for right now but our understanding from our meeting is that even though you all do not meet the conventional requirements for that program they have a little bit of discretion for uh who is eligible and and able to to apply so we're working through that process seeing if there's a way to get chariots on that list so you can Pur pursue funding for security enhancements um fencing Etc to keep your facility and your Rider safe um in addition to that we'll likely be looking at congressionally directed spending as well since it's um appears to be an eligible cost that we could put forward so we think we've got a good good Trio of projects there multiple routes to pursue funding and we'll be uh uh going full steam ahead um since the Congressional Delegation on the Senate side at least has already initiated the Congressional directed spending process for the next year even though the the current year isn't even um over with yet they want to make sure they've got everything lined up and are ready to hit the ground running so uh policy priorities so kind of on the um on the grant funding side of things so one of the big things we've been advocating for is is continued plus up funding for the bus and bus facilities grant program competitive grant program and the reason is even though there was historic uh investment through the infrastructure program into that account the demand for the program still far exceeds the resources available last round there was uh $8.7 billion requested for one and a half billion dollars available in program round funding so just a a huge demand for for um uh even now a limited amount of resources uh part of that is due to cost and inflation um and escalations a lot of that is just uh there's a lot of need across the country that's pent up after years of kind of disinvestment before this bill and before the fast act before that so all goes to say we will be advocating for an additional Plus up we have one right now that's in the Senate's proposed Transportation spending Bill $210 million that would help uh bolster that program for the the next round of funding um but we'll be again going after that again we also were able to work you know with the bus Coalition and other Coalition partners because obviously this is a group effort with our our partner bus transit agencies across the country uh we've been able to pursue and and secure in that Senate bill Court",

        "text": "hello all we'll just give folks a few more minutes to show up it will give people just one or two more minutes to arrive all right i'm getting a few messages here that there's potentially a few people dealing with some slow internet but i think now got enough folks here and i think it's a good time to to kick this off so i'm gonna pass it to our director janine benner to get us going today all right well hi everyone um for those of you i haven't met my name is janine benner as rob said and i'm the director of the department of and i'm actually coming to you from my hotel room in portland maine of all places i'm um at a gathering of the national association of state energy officials and we are um in the great state of maine the wrong portland the other portland for the week sort of learning all the stuff that is happening around the country on energy but i did want to take a few minutes just to join you and mainly to say thank you to this august committee for for joining us today and i want to thank each of you for agreeing to serve on the advisory committee for the new community renewable energy grant program the oregon department of energy is really excited to take on this new program as directed by the legislature last session we're thrilled to be able to support community-based renewable and resilience project across the state but of course setting up and launching a new program is always a challenge so we are grateful to you to for joining us to help us figure out how to make this program a success and our objective for this process today and in future meetings is really to work with this committee with interested stakeholders the public and tribes to develop and adopt new rules for this new program and then once the program is established once it's up and running we hope to continue to work with you to spread the word and to make the program a success so that we can support resilience renewable energy and environmental justice around the state your work on this committee will help make sure that that it's a success um and will help oto realize our vision of leading oregon to a safe equitable clean and sustainable energy future and i'll just say from the past few days being here with my counterpart parts around the country states uh all a number of states are dealing with these similar challenges and opportunities that we are uh in challenges of climate change and energy of equity environmental justice these are actually some of the themes of the conference and have been also topics of side conversations and really people are thinking about how energy resilience ties to economic resilience and ties to social resilience um so in that vein um again thank you for being here and i hope you have a really productive conversation about this new i'm going to tune in for a little while but for now i will turn it over to my colleague ruchi who will share a little bit more about the department of energy and how we're going to be running and facilitating this meeting so thanks for the opportunity to at least say hi and thank you thanks janine hi everyone my name is ruchi soudir i'm an associate director for strategic engagement at the department of energy and i often joke i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't show you all this slide which is basically a revision of our mission and kind of description of what we do based on a strategic planning process that we've been doing over the past few years um we are really thrilled about our new mission we think that it encompasses the work of the agency and describes it a lot better which is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations and you see in the what we statement some kind of buckets of the way in which we make our mission a reality including being a central repository of energy data information analysis a venue for problem solving energy education and technical assistance we have some regulation and oversight roles at the agency and then we run energy programs and activities which is actually this right here the legislature defined a new program the community energy the community renewable energy grant and that is contained in that last bullet and it very much i think we all think will help us with our mission in particular to help advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition so um this this work is very much tied to our mission and the work of the agency and we're really again happy to see you all here next slide please um just a quick note on some logistics um we are recording the meeting and it will be posted online for reference we want to make it available to more oregonians who may not be able to have made this meeting um there's a chat um at the right and i'll show you a screenshot of where to find that in a moment uh we'll be using that to help with the conversation in this remote world that we all live in so you know use the chat for questions and comments there's also a raised hand function that we'll be using to help see where there's interest in asking a question or making a comment and then we will be later working with you to determine a next meeting date so just stay tuned for the end for that and then finally we have set aside some time for public comment towards the end next slide please so this is um you know some screenshots if you haven't used webex before or haven't used it for a while we thought it would be helpful to give you a bit of orientation of functionality for this meeting platform we know there's a lot out there team zoom go to meeting but here we're using webex for this meeting and a few things to highlight on this which is the raise hand function so unfortunately this is actually i apologize this is a slightly different vision so you won't see the smiley face at the bottom which is one way some webex versions can work but this one isn't instead i'll direct you to where it says the second raise hand option that's the way in which to raise your hand so if you uh go to the participants on the right side and you find your name and you um at the very bottom of the list there's a small little hand unfortunately it's very small so you'll have to look at it look for it at the very bottom and it's um it'll if you hover over it it'll say raise hand and if you click on it our team will be able to see in that participants list a little gray hand appear next to your name if you want to lower your hand you you click on that again and it'll lower your hand and so we have a group of people on the line from odo who will be watching for that and we'll help to make sure that you have a chance to raise your hand be seen and ask a question or make a comment and then the other thing i'll note it's next to or under the participants list is a chat function so you um at the very bottom you see like in blue participants in chat um so the participants list again is where you find the raise hand function in chat if you click on that is where you should be able to type a message and i'll do that right and say hello to everyone in the chat next slide please so this one here is just a little background on where you'll find your audio and webcam settings if you're having any audio or or video problems this is a slide that we can help to to troubleshoot for you um so nothing to necessarily do at this moment but in case you need that background or orientation this is here for you next slide please and then finally just a note on how we'll be using that functionality um you'll notice that the there's a sort of panelists and participants piece to this panelists have the ability to sort of unmute or mute themselves their video is showing and basically that's all of the advisory kitty committee members and odo staff running the meeting but we also have a number of participants attendees of the meeting like i mentioned there's some time reserved at the end of the agenda for public comment but those of you who are um on the line to listen in and ask questions you can also send your questions or comments through the chat and we'll be monitoring that as well and we'll try to answer them along the way and if it makes sense to sort of um bring you up to ask the question directly we're open to that as well but we do have that dedicated time at the end um and then i just wanted to list out a few community agreements a bunch of us at odo went to a diversity equity and inclusion conference a few weeks ago and they used community agreements really well and we are trying to carry that forward in our work and really the purpose here is to sort of foster inclusive and respectful meetings and just knowing in this virtual environment sometimes it's hard to do that um and so we're really just eager to have everyone present and ready to learn and be respectful to others and just acknowledging that sometimes learning happens outside of our comfort zones you're not you don't have to know everything at this meeting we're here to help kind of build understanding um and that we're we're we're here to listen and not necessarily respond immediately but think about your comments um and each other's and just generally thank you for being flexible and patient around any technology needs or challenges that may arise and if you need something please ask for it um our colleague linda ross is in the chat and she can help with some of the technical issues that may arise but maybe they won't at all if we're lucky next slide please i'm going to pass it to my colleague rob for our overview of the agenda all right thank you ruchi and for those of you who don't already know me i see i see some familiar faces but um some that i'm just meeting now so i'm rob delmar i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and i am responsible for helping to get this program on its feet until we hire the new staff that are going to take it over to run the program next year so my job has been to just help facilitate the process thank you all again for being here and for agreeing to help us out with this um here's our agenda i also noticed that often it appears that i'm kind of staring off into space on this format i've got three different monitors going and",

        "text": " what we've done twice a year I think you've done an affordable formal thing but even if we looked at quarterly just making sure because I think some of the feedback again involved heard it uh that you know we're just cruising along doing whatever y'all say and so we add to your present at least we can say that we've got a steady plan so that's a thought that I had as well because you know the fact of the matter with some of our facilities are getting a lot of work you know it's the way Bonds were really into uh really all about landscape and some of you you know are obviously are going to willing to be power as they go but you know as they get older they'll get paid then there's issues that arrives so that's that'd be very easy to get a couple of minutes thank you certificate holder program for instance thank you I'm checking Terry Perry who has any thoughts on this one I'm not really I just need to I think we just need to address them as they come okay thank you didn't want to leave me out all right well hopefully Dwayne that's enough information for you to work with Todd and Sarah the rest of the team to come up with well that's important this that's a little different so are you ready to start okay for so for today's compliance update I'll be updating you from the Oregon Department of energy operating facilities that have site um organ energy facilities location Earth status of construction projects and instruction location uh get applies for a plan for July 22 30 June 2023 uh after approach so let's start out with energy energy facilities I get Council of alternative facilities so the department has 37 energy facilities that have been issue inside Fitness and under in this other jurisdiction which will be here today in 13 million Farms level operating four operating and refinement that's the service class uh North separate spots Secretary General Shepherd for Asylum and then look on State Line offensively to American Farm soil now one facility is under construction funds at Summit Ridge Construction must be completed by August of 19 of 2023 lasted Wheat Ridge obese this facility is improved but not under construction targeting their own form organized led the natural gas related facilities of these facilities said in our operating fireworks States during the power plant under reviewing while this is the one that hurting will be on completing which is thanks again sorry I get a little excited um so I guess like I would say the department has a lot of natural gas related facilities of these facilities set that are operating part of the point explosion proof of the word leadership and exterminated just today so that's aqueductive and then you know gas related facilities including two operating flight buildings in the misunderstand storage facility then the department has nine solar facilities one operating and the research three cell episode only three are under construction they've got the solar Daybreak solar Montage silver five solar facilities are approved with construction on our board and solar solar energy facility commitments construction is June 25th 24th or an internal solar facility preliminary requested manner that seeks and so on 2025 you know something that's smaller the deadline for construction is here 12.4 and 0.16. and then let's move on from the other facilities I have listed say father up there in the slide so the garden has three nuclear nuclear-related facilities which are open the independent set of the old powered installation two operating research reactors one that need in college again we're located at Oregon State University and also under the other facilities of the operating 51.25 million watt seam generator for the memory that sits in the middle of uh a paper mill and that's located in Center and that's all we have is just the generator that's all we look at the department has one operating at alcohol ingredients formally alone in a specific ethanol LLC it produces 44 million gallons of ethanol every year and it's located in Oregon Industrial it's an operating 146 500 Global transmission line between Pacific Pacific Course Meridian substation near Medford and then goes to Pacific uh Pacific or Spencer switching station so here's the slide elicit represents the asset uh jurisdictional operating facilities of Oregon in Oregon so the blue and dark blue represents the main facilities that are currently along Atlantic state to have um you know leading geographers we have the Klondike so we have Global emails they can level all pretty close to the board and then we have we urge Memorial and also we have some of their the blue ones also the darker the ones so are operating is the shepherd's plot Central projects along Statewide than the white uh the white facility record represents the only solar facility that you're doing more energy facility that's the 50 megawatt I was talking about earlier one that's an operating and that's uh Associated battery storage now starting here then uh the facilities in orange represents of operating natural gas related facilities that we have on the magazine so we have we have a Trojan hearing aid as well instead of yellow sorry we talked about several years ago about batting with the county projects that are bringing to be the best and uh you so I'll look and you totally agree it's great math what we actually want to use and we can attend these next times the the arrest of the you know the online managing tool this was generated using Giants but this is a sort of static version which is kind of Fallout boxes uh we'll have a little more Dynamic you know map of the future using aressa and one of the things that we have on the list of things to do is try to get those local facilities on there so not only would you be able to see past their jurisdictional facility they can be able to see the local jurisdictional facilities as well so it's on the list we're working on it um and probably by next year uh we'll have that updated so the wreck again is doing he'll stop uh so continuing on the facilities in yellow or Oregon State nuclear Oregon State University Research reactor lives and then we have a majority of the Year up by Rainier I guess I'll find a little bit in one of the last part sorry about that we didn't have to read research reactor right up in here and also in the green up here I can read Mr Colby facilities animals at the moment what's up and that's basically important and then we have uh what else we have like the dark blue ones like we're saying there's three power facilities so any questions so I mean these are just the ones that are in office so not a full number yeah in my next I'll go into construction X so I'll probably start from the pistol and annual chat so this is my construction projects and I'm going to this might be a little bit lengthy but I want to go through these each one and kind of give you an update on what's going on with as much as possibly can um so we'll start out with the fake having Baked Oven solar a blow Baker Bacon and solar and Daybreak together because basically they're you know right next to each other so a Bitcoin solar projects is a pretty solid photo energy generating facility which hit occupying overviews up to 1200 above 178 there's two square amounts with a nominal generating capacity approximately 60 Mega Watts the third related or supporting facilities include 100 megawatt battery storage sortage system Collective substation operations and maintenance building it's approximately 11 miles and approach 11 Mile 230 kbd transmission line as you know of the energy you can still deciding Council approved rfa1 and the government sites or two they're getting which split the through facilities into three certificates Bake Oven solar Daybreak solar project and the sunset solar project that has not started construction all three handles on shared shared related affordable facilities as mentioned above the facility site boundary that we would approximately leave ten thousand six hundred four acres according to adminary due to tariffs and violence exactly a lot of on solar panels they had to cancel their older and reorder another set of solar panels which they have done in the earliest delivery would be September 2022 and that is a that would be the perfect case scenario to build delays and based on Assumption of September delivery that Apple bump out there and cod dates to March 2023 for Beethoven and June 13.3 it was just slit with the delivery is still like and then we have Corbin solar energy facility it's improved solar Volvo will take energy generating facility with a peak generating capacity of 75 megawatts it's located in the safe Island Medium of approximately 798 Acres which is 1.25 squared minus one that's all exclusive Barbies excuse um this is Marcy for the record so you said because of the order from the blind Administration and that's what caused this in mind thought is this is about the first time we're going to see this and all these projects are going to get kicked down the roads and we're I just further recommend to say that we're hearing it so there's a development Bonafide reasons so later when you come up again we're not going to be success exactly what that was or what that meant in terms of the Tariff issue Chinese solar pins excuse me is it not really something that's just a blockchain issue as it is carrots that are caught walking intentionally blocking yes yeah so the there was apparently yeah and On The Wall Chinese solar panels coming into the West Market which was creating a lot of solar energy projects domestic production solar panels then my understanding trying to do routing solar panels through southern other Southeast Asian Nations and so by the administration did another evaluation because uh I don't remember the company but some solar production company in the U.S triggered a revaluation the fighting Administration looked at that allowed it to continue just to go through those Southeast asianations but for a limited time period so it's still allowed to come in you know presumably cheaper than the US sort of produced solar panels but for a limited time period and then they will reevaluate whether they shut those off you know they put a limit on single weapon coming to the U.S first time you know U.S production yeah so there's these are the things that you know as chairman mentioned has nothing to do with us directly but can certainly have a huge impact on please projects come in when they can begin instruction when they legitimately need to request the time extensions so there's there's a lot of things you know could be a tax incentive at the federal level it could be you know the ability to get components whether it's Supply",

        "text": " responsibly about and your needs impacts for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see kind of the way that we beat the mission and there's a lot of programs and divisions here at Odo exciting we have a big report that we do every year we run programs that um on getting bandages with the from the legislature has assigned to us and for this funding opportunity that we're talking about today it will be a new energy program at Odo um that's you know federally funded and it will help the support a resilient and affordable MLP system that kind of links back to our mission next slide please um this is another sort of orienting slide in the picture and after the passage of both the iija and the inflation reduction act Oda recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government and the purpose of that is to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency resilience and other important priorities we did a number of public weapons and we discussed with our energy advisory work group early one of these law scores passed um and we developed these guiding principles on those on this slide to help us figure out how to prioritize and how to how to think about all of the funding that's coming our way so I won't read these all in detail but you know we're basically focusing on Equity including Geographic diversity coordination with tribal governments where possible providing technical assistance focusing on cross-agency Partnerships where uh you know we work with qtq and we've seen quite a bit so focusing on those Partnerships to help us with expertise um and then finally taking advantage of every high priority funding opportunity but also ensuring that we're having the quality work that fits up every available uh dollar codes best use so that might mean we don't we might not go to every single funding opportunity but we want to try to balance that these guiding principles here um and so you'll hopefully notice in our discussion today that we're applying many of you guidance both of the spending opportunity as well okay I think that's it for me I said that to Christine sure so I think we already think of the group introductions for today so we can actually keep moving forward and move on to the next slide people who wants to introduce somebody you did earlier but is there anyone else to joined that or is there anyone that we missed uh a couple additionally we've got right we travel one uh Kyle from energy quest of Oregon uh Jessica reichers from technology and technology and policy manager at Odem uh Jim Crider from the Oregon rural and member of the environmental justice Council uh Christine Go Lightly from Columbia River and Revival Fish uh Natasha Jackson from Northwest Gas Sarah Buck Walter from Pacific War and I believe those are the the recent editions so and then we also have Whitney door from the EQ just that I've mentioned okay thank you and then um next we'll just kind of pop into where all of this funding came from really quickly I know many of you are already familiar with it and have maybe attend some of our other webinars before um but it's a quick um refresher on where this funding came from and then we'll jump into the need of why we're here um the program is funded under the infrastructure investment in jobs act this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars for U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for the American people if I invested in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and green energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow with clean energy and the purpose of these funds as outlined by the news Department of energy is to improve all hazards resilience on the electrical Grail against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of destructive events Advanced Department of energies Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the Justice foreign so the application to the U.S Department of Veterans was already submitted on April 18th we were required to submit that request to the Department of energy by May 31st so we're a little bit ahead of scheduled there um and that was for the first two allegations of funding for the federal program I'm going to program States tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government and then once awarded police can then run processes to issue five Awards and entities eligible as sub recipients such as electric grid operators electricity storage operators electricity generators transmission owners or operators distribution provider and school suppliers um Odo is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer these funds and these are intend to focus on electrical utilities then finally um the legislation conflicts allocations over five years um and the department of energy influence issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time accounting for the extended application deadline that they gave us the first two applications for the state are listed on the slide both a little less than 10 million dollars we're required to pass 95 of these funds through to our sub grantees and the program does have two match requirements first the state or tribes are required to provide a 15 match and then secondly sub recipients are required to provide a match as well some recipients will be required to match the rate of either 100 or one-third depending on their electricity sales in previous year and that is the background so I'll pass it back over to uh Rob to go through the process can you answered do you know if the um state math is that tied up in the state legislature um hold up with the Republican walkout so there is no State match yet is that correct it was tied in with our with our budget I believe so um so it's it's tied in with that and maybe Rich you can talk more to that with me yeah so our budget is out of the house but it's all in our budget so um you can get you the specifics of where it is but the state matches in the budget so as long as the budget passes eventually then our staff same match at someone can you discuss what the utility match can consist of whether in-kind services or other flavors of the funding um I believe that both of those are um I know that our match is going to be a good patch all right so I'm just gonna give a brief history of how we've done make sure is there any questions in the chat based on the family covered no questions yet okay thank you so yeah I'll share a little bit of the brief history for how we got married but we submitted in April we began work on this program last summer and we developed a draft program narrative that was based solely on Wildfire mitigation projects and since then we've done a lot of listening and a lot of Outreach and that's significant changes including expanding the eligible measures to any specification projects not just we've done public hearings in again in March and we had a requests for information where we got some valuable feedback or utilities and the types of projects that you think we're going to see in the program and the result is that we we make some some significant changes to the narrative and we also resolved it in a change in the way that we distribute the bus between small and large utilities and then a little closer every minute um the funding for the large and small utilities are based on a shared of customer sales at the stadium and we have a table to look at that in the next slide but the other thing we did for small utilities was that that's about project DeLorean which was originally proposed at six hundred thousand and so we took that cap away we bought a little bit more flexible anything was wrong James we also build some flexibility into the way that disadvantaged communities are described in the program just a reminder that this is what we've submitted to usdoe as an application and so we're waiting feedback for them to see how much flexibility we actually have on for these things but that's really composed to the narrative next slide please we're gonna discuss it later the disadvantaged communities how you changed the description or where is it different again sure so we have guidance from federal guidance in the form of a matter highlights areas that are clearly defined as disadvantaged communities in the state we have a slide for that later okay but we've also in our letter it said that if you're outside of that map and you want to make a case for certain communities or populations be considered a disadvantaged community would like to let communities make their own case and that's where we're waiting for some to see what the federal response is to that part so yeah so this is a budget summary showing the close to 20 million and that Emily mentioned the 95 that goes to projects we we did the math and found that 25 of customers in the state are served by small utilities Dental definitions and that's the minimum number of we would have for funding in the growth in our narrative we've proposed a carbon 40 percent for these small utilities um built from a little over five and a half million originally proposed to a little over seven and a half million sliding abilities again we removed the cap for utility Max of the Lord ultimate The Narrative can highlight our program objectives number one is to mitigate natural Hazard number two is deliver benefits to disadvantaged communities degree is maximized broad Community benefits that complement the group resilience projects and finally just to continue to learn as we operate the program and update these objectives as we go along with your cheeriors of are those weighted all the same or that's what we're going to work on today you know is the Criterion wait yeah we're going to hopefully develop my charity today if narrative we adopted the full list of eligible measures that are provided in the federal guidance side next slide this is a slightly abbreviated list from the federal guidance measure of Life utility full management vegetation management reconductorate underground a real hardening measures two-thirds of the way down you'll see there's an asterisk on the microgrids and batteries those are eligible Technologies under the program but we have another program I don't know the fund those and the feedback that we got the utilities was to focus more on the hardens and so that's going to be our focus in the first two rounds and also like pulling down for the last measure so the last bullet here new generation and cyber security are not included in this program it's a new generation includes solar wind type the generation projects that could be tied to uh are there any that stand out to you is most interesting or kind of propellant in terms of projects that you were coming",

        "text": " we share what we hear making sure more people know that can request this and not only those who only know the system also locations will be evaluated for compliance The criteria now I am going to talk about This The criteria are similar since the need exceeds the amount of funds in packages that we appreciate a lot but they don't cover everything we have worked with engineering staff to give us cost estimates for projects qualify for locations and then work with the committee of the bonuses to issue recommendations preliminaries in each of these these packages recommendations will consider factors outside criteria such as cost general of the projects We do not want have an important project that costs 8 million because it would take the entire item Then we will look for the opinion of the public after recommendation Until the committee issues its recommendation and present it to the council citizen for approval we calculate This process will take one to two years. I know it sounds like a long time but It really depends on the number of requests we have and your complexity and after this well let's go to be delivering the projects this slide shows us The recommended criteria and what is the screen shows very small print is included in the staff report each category each item has different categories that reflect the program needs We try to were as similar as possible for example equity is not there in all the classification of the streets and nearby facilities such as schools parks etc. the crossings have different criteria such as the like those who also apply replacement of The benches refer a lot to the risk assessment to which he made Brandon allusion I said I was going to speak a little more of the capital What do we mean in this word equity is capital in Sorry base It is equality on the basis of need and we have a scoring tool Equity is based on eight categories of United States census are the best available data we can see the categories on the screen these categories align with those that uses the Kaiser Y organization It was also the one that was approved in the plan traffic management by council citizen then this map I know not they can see the smallest information can identify colors shows all the ways through the census They have a color to represent where fall in terms of equity score between 0 and 25 since it is going to be 25 points of 100 these census roads with the highest score is dark purple and those with the lowest score are those of color yellowish you can see the limits of the districts just so that people orient yourself with this geography tool is not the only way we think equity is important mention that we are going to looking for those communities neglected also with the round table of equity of the city \u200b\u200band then as a example we all take the complaints of sidewalk repairs that Brandon has in the system they were given a score based on these criteria using this 25% equity and what showed this map that we know not they can see but they can imagine the dots are those little dots red or orange in the northern part northeast are the ones with the score the light dark blue are the smallest score let's go to contact those places to identify more points but in this East particular example with the financing we have available Let's go to those who are in red or and then changing to the recommendation to allocate funds to projects short-term paving due is that the process of these projects it will take time for engineers analyzed short-term projects for 2024 and 2025 paving for see if there are obvious needs that could be placed with those projects to increase efficiency So the Bond committee recommended allocating funds replacement of benches to three libert street projects silverton road and commercial street He asked what was the change in the staff report the truth I left out 45000 on commercial street should be in the total sum but only so that you know here it is and with this the recommendation for this area of \u200b\u200bthe agenda is on the screen and you also have it in the report I end with this Thank you, we have any other questions. for the advisory staff J could return to the previous image Thank you I have a short question counselor Philips Well here thanks yul Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Well, nothing more than me. I want to see if this paraphrases correctly We just passed this recommendation processes will be adopted of algorithms which we advice let's make them fill all these items and we are going to select projects for the city there are going to be processes and criterias the final decision of these locations are going to be adopted by city council via of the steering committee But it will be framed by this process and these criteria when creating these filters sorting does create filters classification is efficient so that take charge of all the problems existing do you have any order of magnitude that covers what 50% 20% What percentage I really don't know but The only thing I can tell you is that closest is the pedestrian crossing this pedestrian crossing here the assignment of the background was million the cost will have several pedestrian crossings AND still we have 160 or more on the books then there really isn't much that is covered the other items are a little more high the 8.7 for replacement of sidewalks or sidewalks then here depending how we are operating with 2 million a year 8.7 well, well, he's still alone a small portion of all that So Well, I think that's where we don't have it. less data so we are missing there benches then well we want listen to the public in terms of What are the areas that require of more benches or of benches so urgent Well, thank you very much thank you for that presentation and all these meetings that we have been able to celebrate some other advisory question no please thank you very much then I I very much appreciate and support the criterion that you have identified but what I want to understand is you want me let's follow the process that we apply these processes for future projects and wants that we authorize money for three projects at this moment That's right so those three liverton projects Silverton and commercial Street those projects go through this process no because this process does not exist until approved by the council we were seeing high level to see how I could qualify Then What I would say is that we thought that I was going to have a very good score good rating But I think not but I want to understand why these three projects are put on the same list potential projects and can go First without meeting the criteria eh And the process Well, here I am venturing but the reason why we saw this from the beginning that we see the sciences when we we deliver a paving program that when the ramps are made 88 cu what are required along with those stools so we were seeing what he had logical if there was any replacement that we could do to make a room continuous for people who could go from point A to point B like Brandon had mentioned what to work on In connectivity we review that with the fact that of bonds and well on Silverton Road there are many problems with the sidewalks and Hey then the committee recommendation was to concentrate on one part of the street only just one side of the street So it's either side or east so is making this recommendation the case we could present it for not doing them right now but make them go through the process but I think I would lose the mobilization efficiency Where we already have some jobs in courses on that street then well De according to the Bond committee what I I understood the reason for all this is that maximize dollars in bonus Y so I think we are also already doing work that allows Ah carry out other projects Because these They are projects that were in the queue So then what are we doing? work for other reasons too allows you to cover more projects advisor stapleton Well I I would like to add here I would like to Town area and the map we have is really an area that requires a lot of pedestrian infrastructure then I am thinking about people who don't have car or who only have one car and how good things have to be done measurements and all this here the areas is still quite high but the other is that access to buildings the government So we see this from the point of view of priorities I still have one question, can we go? to the sidewalks and they could take me to the slide where the sidewalks are because I want to clarify right now we are applying the uh equity for our projects and equality for the sidewalks So yes we want to have equity every year we should be assigning 2 millions of dollars for repair of the sidewalks but each repair It would look different I'm in it Well, they're just going to make you focus in the north and in the northeast then seeing that map most of the time projects through the program bonds So the annual program will across town then we with this Bonus we are affecting or favoring an area that is much more great through equity but at same time the program everyone is going to have some sidewalk repair in each of its districts then no I know if you have any other questions for him This is very good. Many thank you we are ready for excitement then I can make recommendations of the staff then in motion stapleton seconded by Philips then working on the bons committee and with the staff and it really has been a magnificent experience for me then with equity frequency is nothing more than a box that we pigeon now we have the opportunity to put it in action that process felt quite pretty good I'm really excited to see the result that we can obtain and that what we can learn from this experience to also apply the equity in other areas of the city in other items then Good when we talk about this equity problem I wanted nothing more make sure that when we see and We ask for public comments let's do it in such a way that it will include to everyone and not just the people who They have access to computers and I am thinking of a person to his students and from district six because normally They receive information from the city through school Then we have we have to see how we are going to transmit all that information to be able to have a response from the public to Another aspect then through the deployment of this process I believe that the language is going to be very important people who know how",

        "text": " the urban area and and considered what is sign ific um since our original mapping was done as the inventory work was underway we moved to step two the analysis phase where we identified the major types of land uses that could conflict with natural resources and then did some analysis to balance the level of protection of the resource with land uses like housing or Transportation balancing also included getting feedback from stakeholders with different perspectives including a technical advisory committee um with representative from various agencies and stakeholders as well and meetings with the community uh to get feedback on our process final step is um oops the final step is taking that analysis and developing the policies and the land use regulations for development that have taken those impacts into account and to help us through this process we hired Cathy's firm to um um who and worked with an internal team and um and to get uh to work on the the policies and the regulations which is our step three here's our project schedule broken down by the various tasks within the go five Pro process the bulk of the time has been spent on those updates to the inventory that helps the other steps um by working on the analysis and developing the local go five uh program culminating in the filing of our ordinances last week the final step will be the public hearing hearings with the Planning Commission and the board this graphic shows the timeline when the community forums were held at the important project Milestones when we first let people know about the inventory process and then this past spring where we were as we were developing our um and getting feedback on our code Concepts this map shows the urban area of Washington County the gray color represents the incorporated or city areas and the blue blue and orange areas show the urban unincorporated area or the area within the urban growth boundary but outside the city limits this is the area where the county has jurisdiction and where the where the proposed rules will apply to those properties that might have significant habitat the blue areas are where our uh the bulk of our consultant team has done the work um with the mapping and the analysis much of that area included was part of the original inventory work that the county did in the 1980s Metro rules and requirements changed in late 2005 so that there are different rules concerning Upland wildlife habitat and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the next slide um for those areas were added to the urban growth boundary um there was a change in 2005 and these areas are those orange areas shown on the map Metro has additional requirements for post 2005 Urban growth boundary expansion areas that will be discussed a little a little later the natural resource areas on the County's significant natural resource maps are collectively called the significant habitat it includes riparian habitat like Wetlands Rivers uh lakes and ponds and their wooded buffers and are shown on the graphic um in the center and it also includes a portion of Upland wildlife habitat priority areas forested and Woodlands adjacent or Upland to that riparian habitat providing food shelter and mating sites wildlife so we noted that this is a limited update to our go five natural resource program one of the reasons for this Project's title is that the board directed us to start with existing inventories and mapping that was done by the county and Metro as the basis for our update to the go 5 inventory we had an inventory that was adopted in the 1980s um to work from and also a metro inventory that was done more recently so the first step in our process was to uh take the county and Metro Maps within our map refinement area that blue a blue and uh Orange area and combine those two maps for the riparian wildlife habitat we applied Metro mapping and for the Upland uh wildlife habitat we considered the habitat areas mapped by both the county Metro um combining those into one Consolidated map then adjustments were made to the map to take out areas that had been developed or maybe were annexed into the cities or where the natural resources had been better identified through a development review process and then we conducted a manual review and data cleanup as part of this we incorporated um any of the more recent inventory mapping that might have been done by cities or um the county for example in North Bethany or Bonnie slope West um those areas that were added to the urban growth boundary since we had done our ini initial uh inventory back in the 1980s as part of the initial refinement we removed certain areas that no longer provided significant habitat and we considered these factors those developed areas I talked about the small Upland habitat patch sizes properties that had been through the development review process and um finally some very small habitat patches on individual Lots or so that there really was um a significant remaining the state Oregon administrative rules regarding goal five requires to let people that might be uh included in the inventory know about it as early on in the process as possible so last fall we mailed a notice to about 4,000 Property Owners letting them know about the project and provided this web tool um and other resources so that that they could look up their property and see where the maps had identified the habitat and here's a map of the cons here's an example of a Consolidated map that shows the natural resources riparian habitat and blue and the areas of Upland wildlife habitat in Orange and Y and yellow and those are those treed areas a bit further away from the habitat and here's the example of a proposed osed community plan significant natural resource map for the Bethany area our staff prepared these updated maps for all of the community plans and they'll be part of the packet of information of the proposed changes that you'll see through ordinance number 901 so the next phase uh in the goal five process is the analysis phase as I noted earlier this is where we identify the major types of land uses that could conflict with the natural resources and do the analysis to balance the level of protection of the resource with the land uses like housing and transportation and we're uh finalizing that work and um we'll talk a bit more about that at our next meeting which will be July 10th and our final step is to take that analysis and develop the policies and land use regulations um that have taken those impacts in into account so now I'm going to turn it over to Kathy and uh and she'll talk a little bit about the code Concepts and give you an idea of what we're posing and then we'll get um a lot more detail at our next meeting thank you Michelle um again my name is Kathy corus I'm a principal with Mig and um I'll be presenting the next few slides so that um as Michelle mentioned uh we'll be going over these in more detail in J at the July 10th meeting um but there is obviously as she described an update to the significant natural resources inventory there are changes to the comprehensive plan there are changes to the community plan and the maps as we just saw an example of those as well as clear and objective standards in the community development code for the protection of significant habitat significant habitat we describing as reparan wildlife habitat that would be as we think of water related habitat and that in itself is comb made up of two parts the Water Resource and that repairing area immediately adjacent we have Upland wildlife habitat that's nonwater related habitat although often it is um adjacent to repairing habitat it isn't always um and again the pro the idea and would continue to be that these things would be applied during the land use review process so oh I jumped ahead but this is a good illustration of how that works so significant habitat again the overall we have specific regulations related to reparan wildlife habitat Upland wildlife habitat and again repairi and wildlife habitat it's the water areas repairi and buffers together so those terms will become very familiar to you all as you read through the code it's organized around that structure so uh helpful to keep that in mind um as again Michelle mentioned there are these significant um habitat areas different regulations based on when land was added to the urban growth boundary and so again I think this is a you'll you'll see this as you review the code you'll come to understand the distinctions between what we call pre2 2006 significant habitat and post 2005 significant habitat the reason for that year change is that it that adoption was right on the C right on the change of the year so December 28th 2005 and so that is the date set by the metro um title 13 which is in the urban growth management functional plan and so those dates will also you'll see those coming up um in the regulations as you review those uh there are General Provisions uh that apply to all types of habitat so those include a density transfer and also we're uh proposing a new adjustment section and this would is intended to allow um developers others to Max still maximize the housing and other uses on the land while meeting the habitat goals so uh it allows reductions from dimensional standards so again perhaps if one could shift the setbacks on the development side or other feat you know other requirements it would allow the preservation of that habitat so the idea is to um allow some flexibility in those development standards similarly with uh required landscaping and screening and there are some basic requirements for all applicants so um if the applic if the proposed development is within the verified reparan habitat they need to demonstrate uh compliance with reparan habitat standards again those are um distinct and I would say uh more comparable to what's in place today for repairi and habitat if the proposed development is within verified Upland repair and Upland wildlife habitat uh applicants get one of three options they can choose the tree inventory and retention option that is the clear and objective option as you probably are well aware we need to have a clear a a path that is clear and objective for applicants to apply however sometimes that doesn't work in some situations and we recognize that so we're also including also includes um a tree canopy and assessment um and protection CER I'll talk a little bit about each of these um that option is available to the applicant as well as a detailed environmental uh report option finally if the applicant believes the map is incorrect they can request a map correction so those the basic requirements now focusing in on repair and wildlife habitat there are use limitations for those areas that's comparable to today that's those requirement ments are very similar",

        "text": " chat a few times I think but um here is uh some information from our website on how you can stay up to date with future progress and announcement related announcements related to these funds you can read on this website a brief summary of the funding opportunities that we're actively working on and our Blog has a periodic future focused update providing context to Oregon's Grant seeking efforts we also have links to resources provided by other entities such as guidebook that has been put out by the White House and frequently asked questions from the IRS related to tax credits and then I also want to point out that there is a link on this website to a q a portal so if you have a question that you didn't get a chance to ask today or maybe you have one um afterwards that you didn't think of or you would like to request a letter of for a grant under this under these programs or discuss a partnership opportunity you can complete the forms in the portal and we will be in touch I really want to hear from you lastly we recommend that you sign up for email updates as we receive new information we'll send notices through email to individuals who signed up to receive the federal funds update all right um here are two upcoming events that if you're welcome to join if you want to hear more Jen will be participating in an Oregon Public Utility Commission meeting on March 7th so she'll be presenting alongside um some investor owned Utilities in the Energy Trust of Oregon to share how the Investments are shaping our planning efforts as we look to the Future and then we also plan to host a second hearing on our application for grid resilience in March we anticipate posting a revised version of the program narrative at the end of the month prior to submission to US Department of energy and more information will be available on our website in the weeks to come on and with that I will open it up for questions again feel free to raise your hand or put it in chat um I realized looking back at the questions from chat earlier someone had asked a question um for homes in here do we know if these will be administered through Odo or through a non-profit like Energy Trust and the short answer is we don't know yet we are awaiting guidance from the US Department of energy on these programs so Jen mentioned earlier that because those programs were passed in the inflation reduction act which was a budget reconciliation Bill the legislation or Congress was not able to put a lot of information within the statute and so usdoe needs to take the limited guidance they got from Congress and put together program guidance and send it out to us that's hopefully coming this spring then once we have that information we'll be able to make determinations like who and how these funds how these funds will be administered and who will do it but our goal again going back to those strategic intentions is to build on existing programs create efficiencies where possible and there are certainly a lot non-profits who've been working in this space in the past that will want to work closely with all right Ruchi I'll turn it back to you to let me know if there are other questions but when I see Stephanie Cruz thank you put in the chat we're currently collecting feedback on the homes and Hera programs so the US Department of energy put out a request for information from States and other interested parties on ideas for program design and we are putting together a response to that and we welcome your thoughts you're welcome to respond to the RFI directly or share your thoughts with us and we can integrate them into the state's response to that RFI so she's offered to take suggestions in the chat or um I think you can also enter them through the portal on our website other questions so far not seeing any raised hands but um getting some information in the chat so one is from Tim about uh curiosity in terms of any new or helpful pieces of information in the announcements from um any change in thinking uh from our end or those announcements I'll let um Jen and Janine think about that before we go to the next one from I'll let Jen start since she attended the webinar this morning yes um so there were actually two different webinars from the U.S EPA um one was on the greenhouse gas reduction fund and the other was on the climate pollution reduction fund and I think um some of the most helpful bits of information were some additional information as to how the climate pollution reduction grants are anticipated to work and some of the timelines that will be moving forward on those so we do anticipate for that particular fund that initial guidance will come out on March 1st and they will start with a planning Grant phase and from the planning grants it will be a non-competitive process which I still think there are quite a few questions about how exactly that that process will um but essentially there will be funds available to enter into planning grants but shortly following on its hit on the heels of that and approximately the summer will be the start of the implementation grants under the climate pollution reduction fund and the greenhouse gas reduction fund will be coming a little bit later than that um starting approximately in the summer so it we're gearing up for a pretty busy spring and summer um and I know a Odo will be working closely with the Department of Environmental Quality as we work through and best assess how how these funds could be used or leveraged for Oregon but I know other entities are eligible for parts of these funds as well so um you know it's not something that necessarily has to flow only through the state agencies right I will just add um Odo during the request for information phase with the EPA worked with DEQ on a letter to EPA encouraging them to set the program up in a way that potentially enabled States like Oregon that already have a lot of existing programs and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to access some of those implementation dollars earlier uh we don't think we think more climate uh pollution reduction planning is really good in the state you know could always do more collaboration and coordination on planning and we have a recommendation in our biennial Energy report to do some of this but we also think that the EPA could um you know be able to support immediate greenhouse gas reductions by allowing us to access some of those implementation dollars to fund existing programs at the great things you need um there is a question about how we talked earlier about collaboration with different agencies and Energy Efficiency stakeholders the question is with the here are rebates being point of sale in the form of a discount whether Odo is working with um State contractors um the implementation of rebate funds and weather discussions on how the influx of demand might affect Supply and Equipment costs so two questions there on working with contractors and then thinking about Supply and Equipment costs without demand check excellent question and I do think these are all topics that Stephanie and others on the team are working through as we respond to the requests for um and I think um maybe this is an area where uh we know we'll need to do some more engagement as we get more information from the federal government on how usdoe is expecting us to deal with point of sale rebates and potentially have some guidance on uh working with contractors another question from Michael in reference to the grid resilience funding and the question is whether that would only go to utilities or will funding also go to non-profits and community-based organizations and might be a little confusing because I know there's several parts to that so it might be worth just maybe talking a little bit about the different types and what the eligibility is great question grid resilience funding that we talked most about today is allocated to the Oregon Department of energy on a formula basis so that's 50 million dollars and there's a list of eligible entities that we are able to sub-grant that to um I believe it is broader than utilities but I'm looking at Jen to see if she remembers off the top of her head but there is information I think on that on our website where you can dig down it and find this yeah um so under the grid resilience application it is primarily referencing entities that that we would recognize as as our utility providers in Oregon um there is an option to identify other types of applicants but that is something we'd have to negotiate through our application process with the US Department of energy um so if that's something that um folks are interested in um we'd highly recommend to take a look at our program narrative once that is published and provide public comment on that through our process as um you know even once that's published as a draft it will still just be a draft and we'll be seeking additional input on that um with the uh with that I will mention that all sub-recipients will need to provide an additional match under the grid resilience that may vary based on their utility sales so um if there's an entity that doesn't necessarily have a sale uh like a sale of electricity that we can point to then we may to figure out what a proxy would be and how to negotiate that that match rate for for other types of entities so um but that's something that I I think we are interested in in hearing feedback on particularly at our public hearing on on March 15th great thanks John um another question coming in is uh whether we're seeing loans or even grants in any of the programs that could help contractors especially contractors that may be from disadvantaged communities scale up and that could include equipment or working capital or help with hiring so that they might be better able to meet this coming wave activity so you know just looking for looks like financial support for the contractors directly great question I'm going to let Jen answer that because she's been following the workforce opportunities more but I do um actually no I'm just going to let John answer it um that's a that's a great question um under the inflation reduction act we do know there will be funding available to provide um contractor training we don't know exactly the full extent of that and it is um intended to go to complement the work under the residential Energy Efficiency upgrade programs the homes in here rebate programs there's a lot we don't know um one of the major things we still don't know is whether or not these funds would be available formula to to every state that expects to receive funds under homes in hura or if it's something we may have to compete for as a state in order to access those funds so that's something we'll be watching for um but I will mention in",

though across all the companies there's some variations maybe some some outl so this is just adjusting for some of these outliners kind of standard standardized those Sal um the uh the next one one of the companies had some so Outreach together one year because of the timing of I think sorry she was like management salaries is that adjustments up or down that's down okay so it's reducing the expense that goes into the okay for the record counsel is here CR CH cranberry sandwiches oh no I'm okay than oh I'm not I told order one so Haven Miss much okay so just briefly uh just real quick that um just talking about some of the changes excuse me we mentioned last month we're just refining we have a little bit more time we're just refining what the the ask is if you from proposal perspec so today this is the we've done all the refinements we've gone through all the members check everything um updated the most recent CPI and fuel adjustments and that type thing so this is just a quick recap why when you're looking at today's numbers why they be a little bit different you saw third point from the bottom as you Outreach exess that comes into it because of the timing one of them had two years of way invoices all that fell and happened there's two years in one n another so we just it was just normalizing between the two years so just the kind of things we're looking at um some Professional Service uh Services more specifically legal fees related toing agreement that that agreement was for a threee period all the expenses so spread that out years of modif if you will and then when we presented this to you last month we had not accounted for the estimated cost of the woman and discount program so this also includes additional expense which is about estimated about $75,000 year for the cost of that is that increasing are we finding more people applying for and utilizing that service um we're constantly have more people I have a fact since you ask about it I'm estimating right now we have about 400 or so participating I'll have a more final number some of this these slides you've seen before um no no material difference but just have them here for conversation if you want to again this is the historical projected returns for County Target no no material change what you saw last month same type of thing here this is just a breakdown more line business or 23 24 25 of those I thanks for let me know so I'm gonna kind of move through some of these but please something if have any questions or pause on most next couple things just going of scroll through what what we've already seen discussed for the most part uh again those cost factors I mentioned Fuel and general inflation there were some changes there just kind of highlighted those everything else in same I'm G to pause here briefly on disposal simply for some context as we have conversation a little later um and that's primarily with the mar G so right now um we are there are no adoped or approved increases of that $874 per time for all the garbage that's disposed of out of County that goes to through our system that rate is set by County Commissioners only reason I'm pausing here is to give that in s discussing just contractual and other inflationary increases that they're looking at their own perspective that are that margin so as anle portion of that goes to their cost another portion of that is held by county to support the overall system and their Environmental Services Division battery program household waste program a number of different expenses related to the overall system of sols during that conversation one of the Commissioners did ask since that we have this erosion of that Mar time because of factors they asked what would it what would look like if we had small CPI increase on that disposal so that tells me that there's discussions happening but that has not been finalized no action that's been taken I just want to this body aware that there may be some movement in that over the next couple years possibly time that could have if there's a change there question you said let's see 8745 ton what's cofin VI uh did I say coffin no you said you said oh so so cofin View is9 thank you and that is going up and that's the so that's going that's the current rate uh that went up to 3950 which is the 3.9% increase it's going up again in 24 and 25 by by that over 7% so we'll see that I do that to $ 38 and then increasing okay that's you want yeah so you do notice it's going up at 7.1 years which is higher than anticipated inflation I just want to acknowledge why the 3950 that West Salem SP is a heavily discounted rate for example the rest of County disposes in 60s and so it's going up a little bit faster because for public services who and operates off your landfill is that a ton of c and quite frankly you don't want to be if you exceed that cap you don't want to be on the bottom of that race because you're going to be the first one that is lost and this is very relationship based um with for public part of the group and so that is just to make sure that um West Salem always has a home at C but that Gap just needs to be shrunk a bit it's at 20 plus dollars it was starting to loal team um so could you introduce yourself yes try CFO of resource Rec facility and Valley Association so let me just tell you back what you said so that I understand what I'm um so p is taking garbage from everywhere um but their their sole purpose not so purpose their original purpose was to help with P County and the surrounding areas am I correct in thinking that it's considered a primary County cor yes so but within that County West Salem somehow has a 50% reduction um almost yeah it's the price in the 60s everywh else in County okay um why was that created relationship based okay um so Former Republic employee finance manager Republic and the relationship of part ship Republic has with Mary murf and the hollers Association um has just been leveraged over the years that relationship you give better rat to your friends basically and that's what that um is really about is just a friendly rate to our business partners okay but that could come back and Vite them because once we have once that cap is reach then they're going to start shedding people who pay the least exactly okay so then we're trying to to balance that a little bit but in a nice gradual way so it's not overnight slap in the face that's right okay we good that's F thank you all right moving on uh so Mar County side this is again this is a summary of that ask from Mar County side for uh the three different lines of business in 2024 only looking at an increase for the Cs which is again mostly residential there are some commercial businesses that Parts this would impact those as well but primarily this is residential no increase for the containers meaning kind of a dumpster size two yard dumpsters or larger on the commercial side and drop boxes which are those temporary construction type boxes no increase uh for the January 1 2024 an overall ask of just over two and a half% 2024 in 2025 uh we have again overall right around the two and a half% we have a small increase um in the drop boxes just kind of moving up 2.85 for container and then 3.35 for C I'm wondering if we need to touch on F there's more nuance this than that what you just said right like if I'm the public and I'm tuning in and I see a 5.35% increase for residential and nothing for commercial my hackles are probably going to go up but can you maybe pull back the curtain a little bit about because I'm you probably have a slide about this maybe because it's it's not that we're favoring one industry over another but if I understand the whole process correctly we have how many different haulers we have six hallers six I've been off today um and each of them have a different lay of the land right so some of them have a ton of commercial some of them have a ton of residential some of them have this nice balance of both and if we have a set goal of a certain percentage for profit then we have to balance all of that within not only the constraints of the Nuance within each business's territory right but then well I guess maybe that's the period right that's it we have to balance all of that and what it looks like this year is that it's an increase in residential and not necessarily right commercial but that's not going to be the case every year it's not not the case every year and so if we we go back to this slide which kind of shows those projected returns by that L of business so the reason why we so for 2024 are anticipating or are proposing a larger increase is that we are expecting a lower margin in that L business which you see is the 5.3% so in order to bring 5.3% up to that Target of 10% we're asking for a larger Ines right whereas commercial is right at 9.6 really close to that 10% drop boxes over 10% they can they can vary so we have a some boundaries we try to keep it at least between 8 and 12% so there kind of 4% that we we try to keep with that targeting at 10% So based off of the different factors and the costs that are impacting affecting each of these lines of business there are greater cost impacts if you will to part the so a larger adjustment in that c I hope that's clear that we're already we're kind of hitting that Mark with those two other just not with this one line yeah so we're not targeting them specifically to just bear the Brent of an increase but it there are reasons for it yeah in fact you'll see that um in P County so for example in P County uh we have we anticipated 5.3% return in part whereas container drop Bo for 3% so we'll see a larger ask",

        "text": " overview council's been provided with this comment in their packet before the August meeting it's also incorporated into uh the comet the comments that are listed that we will include in the proposed order basically just the commenter submitted uh a copy of a paper that she helped write and in general kind of anti-renewable or at least calling out Renewables it's not necessarily being environmental but these comments honestly were not specific to this project it even said that in her submental not specific to this facility this draft proposed order or the amendment request and so just want to emphasize that since our response to comments is is tied to uh being tied to a standard or the facility or the requested Amendment so for informational purposes it was and then our summary of the comments that we received at the public hearing as I mentioned we held the public Hearing in Christmas Valley on August we counted 11 members of the public that were there and an additional seven individuals attended through the WebEx so it was available via WebEx as well the certificate holders representative did make oral comments during the public hearing as did members of council however no members of the public commented during that time we didn't receive any requests for a comment through the WebEx and no one in the room during the hearing wanted to comment so they were there to participate and listen but they had no comments to make I'll go over a little summary but we did close the public comment period at the end at the close of the public hearing on the 24th the certificate holder was asked if they wanted to hold it open the record open to respond to comments and they said that they did not so the record was closed so just a really brief summary of who commented and who said what Laurie Hutchinson was the representative for she made some clarifying comments at the beginning about the irrigated land and the water right transfer and she did make a comment that the change to the 138 KV was probably a design requirement regardless of either inner tie so that was something that she wanted to confirm and comments uh Perry chato council member chuckitude recused himself to be consistent with a prior recusal on the facility and then council members fire Dublin and then chair Grail also made comments in general kind of asking clarifying nothing substantive that would like revisit of any of these issues and then again certificate holders representative confirmed that they wanted to close the record so that was kind of the summary of of what was discussed in the in the public hearing and then based upon all of that information when we take the draft proposed order we get all the comments and we we have the public hearing um it's on the department to evaluate all that information and where it's appropriate or it seems necessary we might revise recommended condition language we might come up with a new condition or or some other uh finding of fact or conclusion of law then that would be different from what was in the draft proposed order however because of the substance of these comments received we do not recommend making any substantive changes between the draft proposed order and the proposed order we will prepare proposed order based upon council's input today so you still have the ability to give us comments and recommendations but at this time we're recommending that the site certificate be approved and amended as um and that the facility can continue to meet the requirements of the general standards of review and the applicable schools so that's kind of where my presentation ends I think at this point it's just up to council to ask any other clarifying questions or make any additional comments but our next step would be to take whatever comments you give us today prepare the an issue the proposed order and we will notice that let me see the proposed the notice of proposed order and an opportunity to request a contested case what's that for post orders right so I will stop at this point we'll turn it over to council okay any follow-up questions or comments a counselor buyer um just on the record just that one clarifying piece of language about um any of the mitigation plans including provision for notice to adjacent Property Owners of a ignition ignition okay and whatever the proper language is and we'll leave it to you to to craft that but I think giving some flexibility to the applicant local government but still providing that notice okay thank any other comments questions okay Miss Sloan thank you very much thank you I did and I couldn't see anybody okay the next item we have um Miss Irene Gilbert is going to provide us with concerns about the fsec process and this is a 15-minute I hope it doesn't take 15 minutes because I already have talked to some about process however um I did submit a letter to fsac following the meeting on July 17th 18th and 19th and and following listening to the decisions that were made on the 19th in fact twice I listened to that I had not planned on bringing this issue forward as a contested case until I did listen to the uh the meeting minutes and also I had requested that my letter be provided at the August meeting for the council to discuss and since it wasn't I knew that the decisions would be made regarding that site certificate Amendment before of council had received the information um and I requested that the council require four things that if flat schedule their meeting so that when there's a hearing there's a period of time between the hearing and when decisions are made to assure that council members have the opportunity to actually read the requests that are made in this instance it was real obvious that people didn't have time to read those comments or or requests um that that fsac require that publicly Public Notices accurately reflect the changes that are being made if you read over the the announcements for the amendment one changes they really understate the fact that for instance they say changes to make it easier to come for Sac to do their work I mean it really minimizes these changes and some of the changes to the site certificate conditions are very very serious very impactful on the public and on public so I believe that they should be required to clearly State what the opportunities are for the public to ask for a contested case that's required anyway and it was not clear and I think if you were to read the actual language and the quotes then my requests for contested case you would see that it was not communicated so when changes are significant they should be presented as significant and there are a bunch of changes in Amendment one that are significant um for example the um the counties were removed from having an opportunity to uh participate in developing the mitigation plans because for at least three different things the fire one the I believe it's the the blasting one and one other one that I I specifically noted oh the uh the uh restoration site restoration you know um now nobody's telling the counties that they are not going to be participating in those changes and it would seem to me that they should have been made aware that they could argue against it and they could ask for a contested case because for example during the Public Utility Commission uh decisions on the certificate of public convenience and necessity uh one of the questions that was asked specifically to Idaho Power is are you including in your mitigation plan the requests that were made by Baker County and Union County for resources to address Wildfire your role as fighting wildfires in those areas and uh I you know I can't quote it exactly but the response was well that's going to happen during the development of the mitigation plan well now those counties are not going to participate in the development of the mitigation plan that they said was going to address these requests that the counties had made and they were very specific requests for equipment and for Manpower and and so I just am really questioning that Odo and the developer will accommodate those requests um now this thing with the counties is and I'm not saying that the counties would appeal because quite honestly appeals to your decisions are very costly and most counties have a very tight budget and really don't have the funding to to do that but it kind of brings me to one of the things that causes me angst and actually it has clouded my impression of Todd Cornett for years so it was because there was a uh excuse me sir Mr Vice chair I would just say please keep this to our process and okay do not get personal okay you have the uh inclination to get personal sometimes and I would recommend that you do not do that okay thank you thank you for the um there was a legislative subcommittee that was hearing a a change to the rules regarding uh Odo and fsac and the subcommittee met and the public made all their comments and then after all of that happened there was a um a work session and Odo came forward and asked that the section and the statute that allowed counties to have up to fifty thousand dollars to uh argue contested cases before uh the department of energy if they disagreed with the final site certificate was removed and the argument was well the counties in and Odo are in agreement we were Partners in this so there really isn't any reason why developers should have to provide fifty thousand dollars for counties to argue against the final site certificate well um I'm sure I you mean Umatilla County I'm sure could use that money now because they are coming up with the budget to appeal in other counties just flat out can't afford it they don't think Mr Vice chair and I don't mean to cut you off and certainly I'll let you go but if you'd like clarification on that point I can I can provide that later on that's not accurate but I can provide that clarification later on I think we'd like to know yeah I'm sure I'm sure there are written notes from that meeting because it was a subcommittee formal meeting that I did attend I made it my application to follow fsac and Odo for the last many years um the other thing is and uh you know when when you pick a derogatory statement about a member of the public I um Mr Coronet here is asking the response it would be nice to get a chance to respond no personal comments okay okay towards me either um so anyway I'm let's see part of this is responding to the fact that I was called the liar High council member in in not so many the um the bottom line is I am truthful um I quite honestly thought that um Council would provide me an opportunity to put together a argument about at least one site certificate conditions",

        "text": " don't you know that's another issue that's it anybody yeah sure anybody have any thoughts on that okay uh all right this next one uh this is sort of kind of gets to the heart about what we were talking about earlier this was raised by Elaine um you know evaluating whether we can do a better job and again this is sort of by its nature outside the scope but then again it kind of does lend itself to illustrating why why it's so difficult to deal with this in this context uh unless we're doing some you know unless our suggestion as as Iraq is is a policy change but making it more clear at the DPO phase that if people have issues with a project that's the time to raise it because that's the that's the best time for a developer to deal with it and for that to be incorporated into the S certificate um it's a sort of like oun prevention is worth a pound of cure we we want to greatly incentivize people to raise as best they can the issue as early as possible and obviously that puts a burden on people who aren't super duper experts to get up to speed incredibly quickly uh but the alternative to that is that people kind of wake up to things way later when it becomes much more expensive to resolve issues and uh so it it seems you know it's kind of an unfortunate reality but you know as an agency we we have tremendous pressure to kind of uh make this process more efficient and so to bog this down uh by not optimizing in this way we' have to have some very very good reasons for doing so but but that doesn't mean we can't optimize uh and we can't make things more efficient given those realities and one of those things could be looking at the D phase and figuring out what what are things that we can do as as a as FC to maximize understanding and improve the quality of participation um at that phase so we never we don't even go to contested case people get their issues resolved um at that time in one way or the other I I don't really have anything more to say on that other than the fact that we kind of as we discussed sufficient specif specificity section um you know we are thinking about this and looking at ways we can engage members of the public throughout this process anybody else have any other thoughts on that one we're almost on guys something I I have a question there um sure what happens when one um writes up an issue for a contested case and then you find that um the alj has rewarded that to where your original intent or meaning is no longer clear where does one kind of go to engage in a dialogue to say no that's not really what I meant the way you said that this is what I mean you're talking about how the ALG is the one who kind of sets the issues for the contested case correct correct like you know an individual will write them up and leave you know kind of a summary line on top but you see the alj in some cases the wordings changed and therefore the meaning is changed and the person raising it um doesn't have an opportunity to say hey that's not what I meant or do they have an opportunity to say that's not what I meant and what's the appropriate forum for that Patrick did you want to answer that yeah I know that that was you know as you'll recall Jim we really spent a considerable amount of time in B2 kind of sorting through that uh and we had prehearing conferences with the alj so that that's the that's really the opportunities when we're having those prehearing conferences with the alj and framing up the issues raise uh any concerns you have about how the issue is Being Framed another way that we're that the department has tried to address that is through the template that I mentioned earlier because it was very difficult for staff to sort through the many different issues that were raised by members of the public and try to frame them in a way that would would allow them to be litigated in the contested case so the purpose of the template and again the template I'm referring to is a template that that staff has uh created that is for petitions for a contested case if people follow that template then the idea is that you will draft your issue in a way that is can be litigated uh so those are my two thoughts are bring it you know work it out in the prehearing hopefully you've you've done it already in the manner you followed the template and if for some reason it's still not happy with the way the issu is Being Framed and when we have those prehearing conferences with the alj uh that's the time to to raise issue right okay I would love to see that template um and and to comment or participate in whatever way might be appropriate but also I would like to say that at those prehearing conferences we don't see the final wording from the alj so we're we're not really haggling with the fine points we're just discussing it and then when they they give that issue um it would be nice if there was some type of feedback loop to clarify that in case the app or the person raising that issue um thinks it's not what they intended and I don't know how to do that I think as we go look at some of the model rules and stuff there's some stuff in there that might be applicable to this discussion yeah it might I I I on this particular one though I'm not certain that you will I would say that that's something in the very first prehearing conference that you have uh to raise that with the alj uh and and so that that's understood that you want to have the ability to to review the way your issues Being Framed you know at some point in time as as Tom has mentioned earlier there's there's only so many things that rules can capture and at some point in time we just you just have to have that the discussion uh early very early in that first prehearing conference with the alj so I would I would raise that and and express concern can I add to that um and the the one example that you know is with um Boardman de Hemingway I presented several issues and the U what ended up happening is the alj accepted um and odo's recommendations for for rewriting those issues and and what it ended up with is and I know I wasn't the only one with this an issue was stated with supporting facts or documentation which would be the the documents or arguments that that supported why the issue was brought up and what ended up happening is the arguments ended up being issue statements rather than than the the broader statement of what the what the concern was and and that posed really significant problems because the issue was lost in the the documentation statements and um anyway I I ended up not being able to really even recognize what my issue was and I know there are is statute that talks about the fact that um you can bring in actually I'm not I don't believe it's statutes I think it's a litigation that says you statement can be brought up and and in arguing it the arguments regarding the issue do not necessarily have to be presented uh during the initial uh discussion or during the initial um wave it or wave it kind of statement so I think that um I think looking back at the Court decisions about the fact that an issue statement is a broader statement the documentation or the facts supporting that um are not the issue you know should not be listed as the issue there are multiple arguments supporting uh a concern with an issue that is stated does that make sense I hope I I can give you an example problems with with uh mitigation actions that are um when the plan the mitigation plan is presented there are problems with the way the mitigation plan is finalized so if that is the issue is the problem with how mitigation plans are are finalized then the issue is not there's a problem with this mitigation plan there's a problem with this mitigation plan the issue is the process of finalizing those mitigation plans is faulty that that would be an example yeah I guess yeah no I guess I you that's just about having an open dialogue with the with the um I don't know that we could do anything about that in the rules um that would in a way that would make sense uh here uh I mean we we give the alj a lot of leeway because the rules do I mean uh we don't dictate every you know millimeter of the process we I mean we trust them to direct it there are a lot of you know obviously a lot of rules that guide what they do and what they're allowed to do but um yeah I don't I I guess I don't have any any any strong and feelings or thoughts about this about this one in particular um Sarah did you you had your hand raised did you want to say well I guess I was just I mean it it goes back to the idea Patrick brought up about a template for DPO comments but it also that dovetails into the kind of the issue that Irena is Raising where like the department of energy and energy facility sighting Council and alj's I think so far have interpreted that your issue at the DPO shouldn't change in your petition for contested case but in B2 both of which situations you know you were looking for a short and plain statement of what the issue is to again afford everyone an opportunity to evaluate that issue on the record of the DPO but then what we see is then it shifts in the petition for contested case and the idea of a short and plain statement to some many is you know multiple pages and if that differs from the comment on the DPO where we might as staff been trying our best to figure out how the petition aligns with the DPO comment maybe both of which were very lengthy it really it becomes just so challenging for I think that if like to create an issue statement that for anyone that represents your issue I mean that was we we had people working weekends holidays living in a hotels to try to evaluate what those issues were in a way where we could figure out how to then evaluate them so I'm just validating that um it's something that you know I would hope the templates are a way to start but we can't re we've in our at least from a policy discussion sort of said well we can't make people use the template we can offer it as an option but we",

        "text": " board but also chariots as an agency to The Chariot staff I say thank you thank you for making it an honor to represent your work the value that you provide to me to my family and the community is remarkable because so much of what you do is behind the scenes or done quietly and professionally I think many in the community do not fully appreciate your whatever their feelings I appreciate you I appreciate your from the maintenance workers who have a more than 99 on-time preventative maintenance performance across all services to the transit operators who get me and many others where we need to go safely and professionally to the customer service staff who help thousands of individuals and to all the many others including the administrative staff executive leadership and two all of these individuals who to modify a popular phrase make the buses run on time thank you four years ago Alan was right when he said that my time as a board president would go by quickly I am incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished together my wife is fond of telling me that though I sometimes have bad days in my day job I have yet to come home from anything chariots related in anything less than a good mood I love this work and I'm so grateful to continue to be part of it we have much more work to do internally and externally but the future is very we are well on our way to building a South Salem Transit Center that will expand and enhance Mobility options throughout the region we continue to upgrade bus stops to make them more accessible to all of our community we are rolling out Transit signal priority which will speed up our buses on key corridors and most significantly we are making plans for additional service enhancements I look forward to working with you all to do that thank you well I I do think that's going to be a little bit of a tough act to follow for um but I am honored to be have been elected president of the Chariots board and I just look forward to building on all the great work that you started as your time as president so I thank you so much for everything that you've done I think as vice president Davidson has mentioned there is a few things coming on the horizon that we should be excited about uh some of the major initiatives and activities that we will focus on as a board an organization include continuing the work set out in the Strategic plan and Dei plan introducing those first ever battery electric buses into the fleet implement the electronic Fair system known as yumo and this one is the one that I'm most excited about which is develop prepare and Implement a service enhancement plan build relationships with Community stakeholders to ensure we are meeting the mobility needs of all members of the while my comments might be brief I definitely wanted to take the time to thank my family I couldn't do it without their support I also wanted to thank Chariot staff because I mean I met general manager Pollock what like five years ago now um just trying to get started and serving the community and he gave me a great opportunity on the community advisory or citizens advisor committee is what it was called back then um and it's been a great journey to now get to hear as president of the board I'm looking forward to working with the board and staff in the coming years as we work to achieve our vision of delivering valued Mobility options that Inspire Community Pride and I want to add that we will continue our focus on ensuring the Safety and Security of our employees and our so well let's get back to work and at this time we'll move into item five presentations and I'll turn it over to General Manager Pollock great thank you the Chariots continued effort to communicate communicate our value to the community we have a trans Dash presentation this evening from James Rubin from transpro Consulting he's going to be highlighting the last couple of quarters in regards to our benchmarking and results it will also be providing an update about the redesign of the dashboard which is coming soon so take it away James it's all yours thank you Alan and thank you uh chariot's leadership team and uh board members for allowing me to present to you today I apologize for the extremely weird light on my bald head I am in a hotel in Cleveland and I was at this lovely desk over here to my right but I was getting terrible reception as is sometimes the case in these hotels so you have to kind of move more toward the hallway and the core area of the hotel so I'm getting better reception here despite the glow from my head so if I'm blinding I apologize I'm going to share my screen now so you'll see less of my shiny head which is always a good thing um and turn this into presentation Mode come on a little there we go um I'm going to take you let me take you to um our agenda for the day so we're going to start by looking at some of the more recent results in benchmarking um results from the customer survey Community survey employee survey we're going to look a little bit deeper at some of the connectivity metrics that we've been developing as part of transdash we're super excited about these and we want to show those to you um and then I'm going to finish up by talking about again some more newly developed bricks and also our redesign um which we're super proud of we're really on the cusp of launching uh our redesigned dashboard redesign isn't really a good word for it let's just call it our beautification effort um we'll get more to that in a few moments when we start talking more specifically about that um so just a quick refresher as to um when our most recent uh surveys were customer survey the most recent results we're seeing here on November 2022 Community survey results December 22 employee results from 2022 and connectivity results from July 2023 I feel like there are actually more because I feel like the customer survey results are actually more recent in this than from November 2022 but let me let me go back to the team and check on that um before I I give you an infinitive answer so jumping into the Benchmark um from the most recent survey results um this is what Alan alluded to in the introduction and and um also your outgoing board president did as well um this is news I've been sharing with you for a couple of months but it's nice to see it visualized especially when you compare chariots performance to the other agencies particularly across transdash so what you're seeing here is a 66 net promoter score again this concept of net promoter sport we ask people on a scale of 0 to 10 How likely they are to to recommend uh Chariot service to friends and family a nine and a ten is a promoter a zero through six is a detractor and we subtract those detractors from promoters to get a net promoter score a 66 net promoter score is an incredibly High net promoter higher than things like Apple computer it's higher than things like um what's another uh very high Disney typically gets a very high net promoter score a 66 is tremendous meaning very few customers are detractors and a tremendous amount of promoters it's also worth noting that on average across all of our trans Dash agencies we have an average net promoter score of 37. so um that 66 represents a 77 percent higher level than our average across trans-agencies and in fact the nearest agency to you guys in terms of their promoter score would be our friends in San Antonio at Via at 46 almost 20 points lower so tremendous achievement here your customers are are satisfied they they like the service and they are absolutely recommended to their friends and family looking at overall satisfaction which is our other way of looking at satisfaction the first one is net promoter score um that's the sort of private sector idea that we we apply to the Transit customer customer satisfaction is sort of overall how satisfied are you um with the service and you can see here again 95 of your customers are telling us that they're satisfied with the um very very very few are saying they're dissatisfied so a tremendous achievement there the average score across trans-agencies is 82. so you can see your 13 percentage points higher than the average of your trans Dash and uh CDTA in Albany coming in kind of second there at 86 also nine percentage points lower than that 95 rate that you guys are seeing here it is very easy to give this presentation to you guys when you're scoring the 95 and the 66. this is much harder for me to get their transdation agencies who keep seeing you guys scoring the 95 and 66 and look at me with Angry Eyes and I say it's nothing to do with me and everything to do with the incredible work they're doing over I want to focus on a very important specific metric that we're following not just on trans Dash but we're finding a lot of the agencies we work with are having issues around personal security both on board vehicles but also for customers who are waiting for vehicles and stops or it best stops in your case so looking at the Chariots results the darker purple here are on board vehicle safety and the lighter purple is your customer's perception of personal security when they're waiting for buses um so you could see our average I'm sorry is someone talking right okay sorry um just so background sounds are going on here in the hotel and it's probably something to do with my internet connection so you can see here chariots at 18 for um percent of customers who feel safe when they're on bullet Vehicles typically um we see less satisfaction for customers uh who are are waiting for vehicles and that's not not true that's true not just for chariots that's true across the entire industry so you could see for customers waiting where it's 74 um 74 is Right a little bit under average so you know I'm not I'm not here to deliver all perfectly good happy news tiny little bit of not concerning news but something to look at carefully which is that on average 74 I'm sorry compared to the average 74 um feeling safe while waiting for buses is a little bit lower however once your customers board that vehicle at 82 safety satisfaction that's one percentage Point higher than our average across trans Dash so um on-board Vehicles customers are pretty much feeling safe waiting for vehicles a little less satisfaction with safety than we see once they board the um we we love to take these results from Community surveys we",

        "text": " on their plants more clouds than they expected out in the desert in Nevada but that reduced air efficiency so you got all the sunlight that's there and we have six months so is there a sun and uh I just don't know how this efficiency works on there also when they put that plant in they destroy the desert tortoise habitat prior when you go into California from Nevada on the uh there was a sign there about natural natural area or something how it was worded that signs disappeared and they wiped out all the tortoises that were in there would just stripped in and put their plant so I don't know how we are what we have here if you can just go through uh there is using that as an example that's it just my big boy and my comment and so that's when I can't speak for any standards that Nevada may or may not have but again I'll go back to ours where we have a official Wildlife standard and a threatened endangered species standard so you know that will be evaluated through our process again I can't speak to what they do I but I I definitely know what we do hi my name is Frank frenzel uh you talked earlier about uh Staffing the place once it's built by three people is that correct and where are they are they going to be part of that and part of facilities or is that going to be their Main Place um you would need anywhere from one to pers uh one to three full-time staff to monitor the site um but the sorry the project uh typically that'd be remote because everything's through a computer type um but on the operation and maintenance um that depends on the contract that we sign with a with a sheep Grazer and what's required for that but those persons would be on site as needed okay because my concern is um uh Mother Nature if she starts destroying some of the panels you know and you have the um uh the material that is an environmental problem going into the soil or the wind coming up picking one of those panels or half dozen of them up and sending them two miles down the road or into the freeway how long is it going to take for somebody to get there and clean that up if even they can so when it comes to construction of these projects there are standards that need to be met for wind tolerances um so in case like you know we look at historic wind data in this particular area to see what's the maximum gust store wind speed and then we would have to design the site to that standard there might be things in Linn County there might be something on the state as well that we have to abide by and then when it comes to the project itself there are warranties that would need to be you know we have warranties and we have insurance on the project so if anything were to happen it would be most likely be covered by warranty and then they would have to get a tech out there as for times wise I don't have the top of my head yeah but warranty and insurance isn't going to take care of what it does to the environment or to the neighbors and that sort of thing and again how long is it you know how long can that stuff sit in somebody else's yard or in somebody else's field until one of your people get out there to take care of it and as long as it's sitting there how long is it going to do damage to the soil and the area from the material that it's built by if the concern is potential leaching of chemicals anything like that there's that's not a thing that happens with these panels there there are no chemicals to be leached into the ground to contaminate soil from from the panels as for if there isn't any damage on any you know naming Properties or anything like that I think that would fall under something that would have to be communicated between the project I guess like us and the local County to take care of the residents at that point and then to a point where we would have to uh you know make sure that those things get sorted correctly in the sense that I mean yes my parent company is elsewhere this my company is located in California but there's no one in the local area so there has to be some type of operation maintenance to make that happen whether it's that we have someone nearby or it's a you know a plan that's set out with the Linn County or something on that sort well that's what I'm asking are you having are you going to have somebody nearby 24 7 because you can't you know you can do all the studies you want on nature and and how much rain we have and clouds and wind and that sort of thing but that's just you can't judge Mother Nature if she gonna come in here and start raising hell um you got to have something to back that up and and protect everybody around yeah so um that's what I'm wondering are you going to have somebody around 24 7 to take care of anything like that the batteries go bad the the fire suppression doesn't work you know now that's a great Point um that's a very valid concern I think it's a little bit too early for us in this process because we are at the beginning just to sure but on other projects how do you have how do you maintain that do you have Crews there do you have uh maintenance people that are there 24 7 or do you just do it all remotely and hope for the best in other parts of the us where we have projects it's a collaboration with the uh Fire okay all right thank you I'm sorry I'm back a couple thing one question is and don't answer yet and you have to sit down but one question is can you can you talk about the heat generation from a solar panel in the middle of summer um I thought this was important because this sitting count uh sending of an energy facility is this group of seven I'm not going to give you their names I'm just going to give you some info one lives in Rainier one in Regine one in K Falls one in Salem one in Salem one in Bend and one in Tualatin of that group one of them is a current Secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Western utilities Health and Welfare also an i assistant business manager of an IBEW another guy is a land use planning the other person is a culture and Heritage Department director another one is a owner of a real estate among other different things and an industrial commercial property manager another one is a board member I thought was really interesting with Salem Electric and the last one is a uh retired a retired community development director I find that kind of airstring these These are the guys are people along with your administrative rules that make the decisions and uh um I find that difficult to swallow based on what I've seen here tonight I hope you have plan B is there anybody else in the room would like to speak before we go to the phones okay uh yeah real quick I want to give people on the phone so it's a big deal and it sounds pretty hippy but what about the light pollution during night time we already have enough with all the big towns and I don't is there noise with these things moving around that's going to get all about you well yeah so is okay last questions there I can answer a couple of them um so the noise question um there are noise producing elements so obviously solar panels don't create noise but the electrical lines the inverters the Transformers the batteries because they have cooling units all create noise we have a noise standard uh where we evaluate those um not during construction and construction's exempt but those have to meet certain time frames within the day um in order to minimize impacts you know to adjacent uses but in terms of the noise during operation that absolutely will be evaluated um I forget the second question oh light light pollution um that's going to be also something we look at we do not have any particular standard on that but the County May and I don't know if that's the case or not so some counties do um have um healed shielding and hooding requirements so that they don't create night pollution um the solar panels obviously won't but there could be you know security lights around there so um I'm not familiar yet with the Lynn County land use requirements obviously the applicant has heard that question um already so if they propose you know shielding and hooding on their own even if there is no standard that would be something that they could do okay I think we're gonna go to the phones now I know okay one more one more in my name is Arnie kampfer I live directly across the road from this uh proposed project and besides being completely objective to it I was opposed to it uh what kind of fence do you build around one of these areas the standard is six feet uh chain link with one foot Barb but that's also dictated uh by Linn County whatever they require us to use and so there would be a six foot chain link fence around the entire perimeter of this is that what you're saying uh for whatever is considered project within the fence area it could be a six foot plus one is what we call it or it could be a seven foot chain link fence um and then if the Locale requires us to do some type of vegetation buffer or screening then that's something we would how large a buffer area would you have around there for fire prevention uh typically we design these projects with a 20-foot buffer from the panel to the fence uh disc is that disc up annually or how do you prepare that the avoid fire in that buffer zone uh that would be with the operation maintenance to maintain the inside of the site to make sure it's clean okay but how do they do that for this particular project that's to be determined just because we are proposing cheap grazing so that would have to be part of that agreement and if there's anything else needed that can't be controlled by a vegetation clearing from that then that's something that would have to be worked out so it's a little bit too early to to say so this has been mentioned earlier but the the enormous amount of elk in that area that migrates through there on a very uh on a basis a regular basis uh maybe monthly or so and this fence is going to detour those animals from going around that project is is that the intent of it is to keep things fenced out of there also get a little bit to the fence so part of the fence",

31st 2026 is usfs one of the permitting agencies that's kind of in the way no good I'm going to see them on Monday so I would be very happy to talk to them it was nope they are not AR they they forest service has some permitting responsibility don't they um they're actually not our lead agency through NEPA because we got that congressionally directed spending request it's coming through Housing and Urban Development and so our NEPA Authority is actually HUD um that we started in Phase One Amendment to was to begin that NEPA process because that was our longest lead item for permitting um and so it's actually coming from them to certify an environmental assessment our other permitting authorities are um the Army Core which we do our 404 permit with and really the long lead time with that permit is that there's a biological consultation with national marine fisheries and uh those have the longest response times but this uh amendment that we're approving today will get us through all the permitting is that correct yes this is 100% engineering and permitting and it's also bid phase assistance because this project is coming out of our community services department from our economic development program and so Mal Foster and elanie is assisting us with getting that contractor on board great uh would you prepare a memo to HUD for me uh I'm leaving tomorrow morning on a plane to DC and I have a meeting with them and I'd very much like to put this in front of them and say hey this is a priority so don't don't take your time thank you great I'll take a motion okay Madam Sher I move that we approve the architecture and engineering standard Professional Services agreement with Maul Foster and along G Incorporated in the amount of $221,500 to provide engineering and Permitting Services for the Detroit Marin's excavation and resiliency project through December 31st 2026 I second the motion is there any further discussion hearing none all those in favor please say I I I the motion passes Larry thanks for your work on this a good job all right now under Public Works we're going to consider approval of amendment number six to the contract for services with Keller Associates to m255 426 for public relations project management base and pilot testing and additional septic system design tasks for the North sanm Canyon sewer project good morning all right morning Commissioners my name is Chris IMO with Maran public works here to talk about uh the Keller contract increase um amendment number six uh in the amount of 67 uh this this contract Amendment uh would expand the scope of skeller uh Keller Associate Services um to first and foremost include a field uh pilot test of an infiltration Basin that Basin is essential to the plant that is proposed to serve mil City and gates with sewer Services which will allow us to dispose of the effluent generated by the plant into the groundwater um in a safe and responsible manner that will then allow it to percolate through the groundwater and it will eventually um come in contact with the river so our purpose is to determine the travel time um the sustainability of that discharge and um find finally to to prove up our groundwater modeling that we've already performed um using uh realtime field data uh this will consist of constructing a very small Basin on the proposed site uh and just essentially filling it with uh ordinary tap water um just to see the um hydraulic travel of the water and compare that to our modeling results and this will all be in support of our um water pollution control facility permit application with the DEQ sure the I'm sorry was there a question isn't I know that we're going to find the actual answer but don't we believe that this is like a multiple multiple month process for the water to infiltrate and actually get to the river yes so so we're going to approve this contract we're going to do this test and then like next year maybe we'll know the answer is that kind of how we expect this to work uh we'll we'll be able to monitor it uh it's a rate of travel um and get some preliminary data much sooner based on monitoring Wells that are on the property okay um so we'll see some data coming into that which will support our application okay um the remainder of the data that will be collected over that year will be um followup collected for the DEQ um in order to um basically it'll it'll be they'll already have made their determinations based on preliminary data that was going to be my question yeah CU I hope we're not waiting for 15 months or 17 months and then be like hey DEQ you know let's get this show on the road so okay no actually we we'll be submitting so responsive right exactly we'll actually be submitting based on the computer modeling alone okay um so our permit application will not need to wait for the start of this process but this is something that they um that we we need to do and they want us to do um for the for the long-term support to hold that permit okay okay uh the contract will also add uh public relations support to help us keep up with the community engagement um for the uh four communities so this will include um all all of the work that we're doing keeping the community engaged for the plant to service Mill City and Gates um plus the ongoing efforts uh up in Detroit nidana for um commercial septic relief and um the the master planning and um design of a future plant to serve those communities does Keller provide that public relations support report or are you Contracting with somebody else to do that we'll be contracting with Keller and they'll be adding Mig as a firm to um provide additional support um this greatly expands the um the amount and time spent um doing public relations support and this will cover uh kind of public relations campaign that will extend all the way through 2026 okay and then the contract will also provide for um some of our um field research and support before we engage in engineering design so that will include uh topographic surveys uh geotechnical analysis and the Environmental and Cultural clearances for the proposed sites of our major facilities in the m city and Gates portion so that will include the um water pollution control facility itself its proposed site and the um proposed pipeline connecting gates to m city this is all a budget expense under the project which will be met with arpa funds there are no impacts uh anticipated to any other funding sources or uh or other local funds thank you any more questions I do not all right I'm ready for a motion mam chair I move that we approve amendment number six the contract for services with Keller Associates to add 705 $367,000 for a new contract amount of $3,255 426 for public relations project management Basin pilot testing and additional septic system design tasks for the north Santiam Canyon sewer project through December 31st 2026 I second the motion is there any further discussion hearing none all those in favor please say I I I the motion passes thank you I'd um be interested in seeing the public Outreach plan the Mig who I'm not sure I know of would is going to be doing yes I can send you a copy of that as well and there it's in the scope cool you all right and our last action item of the day we're going to hear from Greg Walsh on Maring County Emergency program good morning Commissioners Jen uh gr Walsh Maring County Emergency director uh so today I am coming before you to request the approval of the incoming funds from the Emergency

considered doing it through the cities that were impacted or you think the county would be the best because like city of gates and detroit contracts with marion county to do we have an iga with them that they do our building permit reviews but we do our zoning review first so we take in our building permits and issue them i know i'm probably getting into nuances so by all means we can talk about this at another time it's the end of the day um and i can talk with you off but i'm i just i i hear your process and i'm like oh okay i just want to make sure that we can really vet it and get it going like february for folks and not have to what i've seen in the past year and a half is that we have a lot of delays we we just have things that had we been able to talk about him a little bit better like now where you all in your it it could roll out better and i would love to help be a part of it rolling out well in our community you have to answer your question i i certainly admit that there will be bumps along the road and challenges and it is a new program and a great program and the the relationships with counties and with cities uh the reason i i was just speaking specifically towards marion county is because they do have the the uh they are going to be out doing the verification on building permits and taking a lot of those permits and so i guess we would start there but you're all the information needs to filter whether through the counties or or us speaking directly with cities just like in jackson county with talent in phoenix uh same thing as you're saying in marion county um that that we have to be able to work with the local jurisdictions at each level and make sure everybody understands how the program works we want to certainly make everyone an advocate um and we will rely on on people like yourself to help us get the word out and figure out the best ways to to um i guess refine these systems at a broad strokes level you know we can give you that idea of hey this is how it's going to work with permit offices everything like that but you're right um the details of who is is getting that information out directly to survivors and whether they understand how how the permitting process works even beyond our program we'll have to make sure that that's clear and we'll work with the counties and hopefully local jurisdictions to do any feedback you have on simplification of the process uh you said something interesting that maybe you went over uh survivors is this is this program going to be eligible to properties that were destroyed or to property owners who lost their homes so this this particular program is focused on community building and focused on rebuilding the structures okay and so it is incentives just directly for re rebuilding structures and so i know housing community services they've been focused more on the people so if you say uh consumer business services and oto of energy are focused on rebuilding structures and communities um housing community services has been more focused on rental assistance temporary housing and affordable housing and some of the and they actually got a lot more money to focus more on the people and how they can help we're going to do the best we can on our hand to help people rebuild but on for better or worse our funding is kind of directed on just specifically on the rebuilding of those structures so what i the reason why i'm asking is detroit has already had a lot of our property sell um people have decided i can't rebuild i'm leaving so with that property say i purchased a property from some someone who's home built it's a you know a vacant piece of property now am i eligible to be sorry i'm laughing now i actually didn't buy a piece of property but in concept would i be eligible for the program we really want to keep these yeah we want to keep these communities vibrant and get them back up and running we realize owners will will leave and and um you know that's we're unfortunate for that that level of hardship but the reality is we want things to be rebuilt in these areas and because we're focused on energy we want them to be rebuilt as affordable and energy efficient as possible and so we're trying to help those people we have to kind of be agnostic to who the actual owner is what we can do and the little piece we can offer is additional incentives to owners that uh qualify at that low to modern income level that you know alan is talking about the challenges of that that's our one piece of trying to we'll call it the heart piece of what we're offering uh but the reality is we are kind of have to be agnostic to the owner and i think that's great i mean i think i think i appreciate that i think it's good for our communities i i was concerned that if this was only following people who were impacted by the fire and not our properties that we'd be missing an opportunity to have some people build more energy efficient um homes and structures so that's great um okay i've gone over all of us one last thing that created when michael put up that slide about the incentives it said draft on it so we're still refining those numbers so if you have any comments about what those right levels should be let us know i'll uh coordinate with chris trussell our building uh official at marion county and talk with him a little bit and then our our loan program that we do in cog that you're some of you might be aware of i'll i'll check in with our staff and just see if think it sounds good looks good or if we can get better feedback that'll help folks so you all are doing a great job and i'm glad this is happening thanks macrae we really appreciate the feedback on the extra time we got with you thanks for raising your hand it was a good conversation okay yeah i'm sorry i missed for like 15 minutes i was seeing this a lot i muted and i've seen the slides and i was like ah i wanted to know what you're saying okay have a good night everyone thank you too thank you be well",

        "text": " comments received before the close of the record of the public hearing and agency consultation and the proposed order the department must recommend either granting a site certificate with conditions or denying a site certificate for the facility and as you know we recommended that Council approved the site certificates next slide the list here is a list of standards based upon our review of the proposed order and then changes made from the draft proposed order there were no substantive changes made based on comments received under any of these standards listed on the slide that is not to preclude counsel from having questions or wanting to cover any of these standards it's just that they're not the focus of my presentation today there were two standards that we made what would be considered substantive changes one is organizational expertise which will be my next topic of discussion the other one is under the land use standard which is where the issues in the contested case proceeding fell so that will get covered by Aaliyah and after I'm done with my presentation part on the proposed order but I just want to be clear with Council that it's you have the ability to ask about any of these standards as I go through my review next so at the DPO hearing council member Condon raised some concerns about the organizational expertise standard and our Reliance on information provided by the applicant that would indicate that they were relying heavily on the expertise of their parent company Capital power for both the financial assurance and also the expertise um during the June 24th review of the draft proposed order the applicant provided additional including a parent company letter that stated very clearly that they stand behind the project it's also an attachment to of the proposed order as notice um these oops I'm on the wrong page read my notes so at the DPO hearing um the applicant had asked to hold the record open to submit this information which is why we continued the the hearing until June next slide I think yeah and in that letter that was submitted by the applicant we were able as a department to to make additional findings of fact in the proposed order and we felt that these addressed some of the concerns and the raised by councils on the record of the DPO when they did their review um it's important to note that Capital you know has been in operation since they have an investment rating under the standard poor s p they own 15 operational wind and solar energy projects in North America eight in the U.S since seven in Canada Capital power is the parent company and would fund the construction operation and retirement of the facility and in the letter signed by the senior vice president and chief legal development and Commercial officer of capital power it stated that Capital power stands behind the project and is committed to providing Financial Assurance as outlined in exhibit M of the application and the human capital and expertise outline in exhibit d it also affirmed that Capital power has the financial wherewithal and expertise to develop construct own and operate the next slide So based upon these additional findings of fact we made revisions to the recommended organizational expertise and we basically proposed a new so prior to construction the certificate holder shall submit to the department a guarantee signed by its parent company guaranteeing payment and performance of the certificate holders obligations under their site certificate using the form that was provided by the department and provided in the final order on the ASC attachment app or substantially similar to that in the final order attachment F if approved by the department in consultation with our legal counsel at Oregon doj so that was the change that we made based upon the additional information that was provided under organizational expertise there were no other substantive changes under this standard I don't know if Council has any questions at this point next slide thank you Cindy Condon for the record um I am one and I may have missed it but do we have form f do we have the form I believe it was an attachment in the proposed order okay um and I I didn't find it um and so maybe okay what not we can you can point it out um I think I think it's important that we see it yeah if we're considering it here okay thank you okay we will try to thank you locate that form for you if I can set something I should pull up now no okay so should I move on to this drop hole for the record Todd cornet just trying to address your question council member Condon would you like to see that now or you're just you want to make sure it's in there just want to make sure it's in there and yeah I mean I think generally the straw poll I I think these changes are are quite good and it's just that I'd like to see the form and think we should all see it yes it doesn't have to be before this drop okay thanks okay thank you all right so at this point in the Council can have a straw poll on whether to agree with the findings of facts conclusions a lie and the conditions of approval in the proposed order for this standard for the organizational expertise standard or to indicate any specific changes in findings of fact conclusions of law or conditions of approval under this organizational expertise standard and the changes in the proposed order Madam chair just to kind of go over this again the way the structure works um you know is throughout this Kate's presentation here later on through the exceptions we'll go through a series of straw polls that you know will allow us to determine you know if you want to if if you're going to agree with you know the information in the proposed order the information and the proposed contested case order or if you want to make any changes to those that'll just help us determine if a material change hearing is needed later on so that's the purpose of going to the Straub hole so essentially as Kate said you know with regards to just the organizational expertise standard you know the question is are you are you functionally fine with what's in the proposed order you know are there any changes that you would like to see made in the findings or the condition or do you not agree with you know that at all as Kate had mentioned we're not going to cover any of the other standards we'll come back to land use you know after the the contested case kind of exceptions um but this is the only one right now that we have teed up for you to evaluate um I wanted to be very clear as Kate was that if there is any other standards that you're interested in we can cover those we can take strop holes on those but effectively this is really the only one that we're bringing up to you right thank you secretary Cornett so council members of first I would ask does anyone have any need to address any of the other standards okay so we don't want we don't need that and so at this time I'd ask if anyone has any comments about what's been presented at this time councilmember Condon thank you just um back to the findings of the additional findings of fact and the fourth bullet point which I just lost my my screen here but on the fourth bullet point that you read okay um I'd just like to reconsider the use of wood as opposed to Will and I have addressed that before we've talked about it before and it's that the reason is I believe that wood is more as opposed to will which is certainty and if the site certificate is issued um but I could be wrong about that I don't want to wait and I want to put it up on the screen okay can you go back go back one more slide so if you go down it says the parent company to the LLC The Entity that would fund the construction operation or retirement or the proposed facility that's that's the one year okay so council member Condon has raised her question so I would ask first is there um any comments on that question and then this is that moment where I'm looking at Patrick I believe this is Patrick question at this time and",

        "text": " great can I ask what the goal is between now and the next hearing so that you can select an appropriate date for that reason yes that's a very good question um I think that I think there are some concerns on the commission about the viability of that space um given the given the various um restrictions on it and how how it could be accommodated in terms of land use so land um industrial you know the selection of what kind of industrial sites could go there if we if we have um 4ot barrier for example what does that mean if we have flood plan restrictions what does that mean it seems like it would be it would be helpful for us um if you would come back with some more information on how that space can be used um and what are the restrictions that you're dealing withes that make sense okay and then just I just want to make it clear that my applicant doesn't have any any development proposals so the site is entirely PID there are buildings on site he is asking to just be able to utilize them in an Industrial Way um and it feels that right now his hands are tied he can't do anything with the property because he can't implement this uh Zone uses on the side as it's I understand that I think that I would say I probably a no vote and you probably don't want that and you might get a better outcome if you come back that that's where I'm coming from but if you want us to take a vote tonight I'm just not sure that I I mean we're we're aware that the multif family designation have been put in place near the site requires pretty large setbacks and type landscaping um and that is something that we've advised our client that he will be up against if he decides to modify alter redevelop this site at this stage it doesn't appear that that is his goal um and I don't I don't know that I could present you with anything that would be would change your mind right so we are aware that there would be these these um incumbrances on the site with the setback the Z on setback but um I think he feels that the de restriction is a greater hindrance to him since he cannot utilize the site that he purchased for any reason at this point thank you I me it's ultimately up to the commission so I mean staff is what you know happy to go back and look at it even if the applicant doesn't agree we could come back with with those conditions we could look at only allow certain uses in that zone um you know landscaping or you know setbacks or something like that so we're happy to take another look if that's what the commission would like us to do I think that would be my preference but see I see one not I to look at my colleagues to I think even a greater um explanation what those uh Zone to Zone setbacks look like as part of the you know staff report would help inform our decision and if there were additional non additional measures without being overly orous that could reduce the chilling effect as you said other other thoughts no what is the procedure here if we have a motion on that um is this the substitute motion the motion would be to continue it too although the applicant didn't agree to any date so is March 19th and okay date for you um sorry it was the 19th right March 19th or April sure March 19th is great so there's be a motion continue to so I would look to commission Vice for our Mo our substitute motion to uh continue the hearing to March 19th I move that we uh continue the hearing until March 19th can I have a second for that Dan thank you m rockstein second thank you right any discussion on that all right if not call the RO please commissioner Austin hi Commission I commissioner sler I commissioner I commissioner TR I Comm all right I think our hearing then is done was already done all right so we are moving on I understand think we are at have no resolutions oh we've already done that we have no action items no special orders of business that's what I tring find no informational reports is that correct subcommittee reports do we vice president hel does not have a subcommittee report commissioner quad is absent uh so we'll move on to the best part of the day the planning administrators report uh where we get to ask Lisa questions I don't think so I was supposed to report I that's what it says now I have um I have finished the draft of your 2023 annual report um so I'm going to send it out by email word version if you have anything you want to add and then we'll send it off to folks that make it look conrete um so you do have the opportunity presidents later if you want to write something for the report like a letter or statement president GG did but you do have the opportunity so um and then you and I will work together on Council date if you want to go to council and present it and speak and we'll work on on that date hopefully in March that's all I have any questions on the plan administrator are there any comments from go to the order oh I did want to say I have for the 19th although I can move it now this I don't know um Ur staff are going to come and do a presentation on Urban Ral areas how they work Comm Ro is I still think we have time for that even with this continued hearing it's the only hearing so hopefully that is okay we're still trying to get somebody to come um on natural resources and I asking you were saying and I haven't heard what dat we'll get that set up to all right thank you we have no other business we are",

        "text": " with our abilities I want to thank you for your consideration thank you sue Wells can you hear me yes thank you my name is Sue Wells I live in Ward 2. I am a mom of very young kids age three and five and live directly adjacent to the superior rural overlay Zone at the edge of Commercial Street um bottom of Superior Street and so between the edge of Commercial Street and the Fairmont Hill Neighborhood we cross Commercial Street every day a rain or shine or sweat to walk to school we walk to local parks downtown and the grocery stores above the hill it is both a function of where we live and a choice we make as Walkers along the South Commercial Corridor we intimately know the ins and outs of the streets sidewalks crosswalks and alleys we can tell you the best and worse places and times to cross commercial streets and the places on our route we will have to make huge Duty huge detours to avoid because it is not worth the risk to us with small kids we know which houses have friendly cats and we know the neighbors to check in on when there's a heat wave we know this place because we walk but walking here is not always easy we've been yelled at from cars for crossing at legal crosswalks we've had crossing lights so short that they changed before we could get across and we know that people on this stretch of Commercial Street are usually going somewhere in a hurry in their cars I know that reducing vehicle use by encouraging walking biking and Transit is a major goal of the Salem transportation system plan for livability pollution control traffic and meeting climate goals however given my experience as a pedestrian this area I believe that opening these areas up to higher in denser development achieves the goal of walkability on paper only but not in practice ultimately removing the overlay zones without first addressing the real walkability issues that exist here is putting the cart before the horse here's Commercial Street itself is not walkable it offers little shade note buffers between the sidewalk and Road heavy fast noisy traffic and free frequent vehicle movement in and out of commercial buildings an example of this is my kids can't hear me when I talk to them when we're walking on Commercial Street sorry I'm just a little nervous um I've never done this before you're doing just fine thanks the paved alley that runs from mission to Rural Street is the hidden key to this corridor's walkability to downtown along Commercial Street I don't know if you can see a map but there is an alley that runs from mission to um to Rural Avenue and it only works because commercial Ave commercial activity along its length is low and predictable there are established shade trees and green space and the aesthetic transition between homes and businesses is smooth another issue is Transit access Crossing commercial or Liberty Street is um currently unsafe to get the 21 bus route there it's very unsafe trust me I've done it with toddlers the lack of protected crosswalks the timing issues at the lights and the dangers of crossing at unmarked intersections are massive barriers um so in conclusion walking is a choice I would urge the city council to make that choice easier when walking biking on Transit are the only options for folks Equity demands that the city ensure the way is safe especially for vulnerable folks like young children elderly and disabled Milwaukee city is an equity Equitable City I know I'm past my time um but thank you for listening to us we really do care about this issue we we really welcome new development in neighbors but we just ask that it be done thoughtfully thank you so much thank you up next we have Mark wig and John thank you I'm Mark Wiig I live in Ward 2. and um I thank you for serving what I would want from you folks is to ask staff how they came up with the height limits they came up with because when I go to the literature and the research anything over you get higher buildings you have it's less safe it's less Community oriented it's less energy efficient it is not a good way to live and numerous Studies have shown that so how you know using their rationale for height limit we should have 200 foot height limits because we just want to pack people in and we want more density no we want a better and a livable City and when you go above four stories you reduce the livability of your city look it up there's plenty of documentation on it and so I'm not worried about taking away the um overlay zone so what I'm worried about is the mixed use Zone throughout the city if we're allowing that sort of seven story buildings up next to residential it is not a good and um that's all I have to say just as staff to please provide some justification of why 70 feet versus 35 because the research has shown that's not where you want to go thank you good evening mayor and Council my name is John prohoski I live in ward 2. and I have some written testimony that please accept my apology that I didn't get in earlier but I've had many that kept me busy and but to get to the essence of this I am not in favor of removing the overlay zones because they because you're just focusing on the incompatibility between mixed-use zones and overlay zones don't mean that they don't work I'm in favor of removing the height restriction and I live in one of them I live behind day night donuts and why go to my backyard what I see is a metal storage I see a dumpster I see a 13 no 12 foot high building that is four for four feet above my my raised bed which is four feet above my which is what the slope is three feet so it's twice I have a building I look at that's 22 feet higher than my back door on the that's on the Southeast corner on the northwest corner there's a 32-foot building because of the height difference and it's 16 feet tall so I know what people are looking at and why I say it works is the overlay Zone was the intent of it is to mitigate the impact of commercial development on and I would encourage people to well counsel to defeat it remove the height restriction the overlay Zone and make it make the two compatible and take what we've done with overly zones and scan and extend it to the rest of the city because who it will improve the city you walk in the city people come to the city to look at to check and see if they want to live here move a business here it's the overall impression of the city you want something where people drive around town and say it works I like what I see and that's the best I could hope for please consider what I've said and put the interests of Salem before the interest of commercial development or personal preferences let's make the city work and that's one way to make it work thank you very much thank you up next we have Lori Walker and then Peter bergel I can hardly hear anyone so I'm going to move this and see if people can hear better good evening mayor City for the record I am Lori Walker Ward 2. I am speaking as a 40-year resident of longer than that in Salem I've waited two months to say some of this because at the well at the meeting in July I was and am still concerned regarding negative comments about scan in the July 26 council meeting some comments by counselors implied that we think we are special I think we are respective of all neighbors living in Salem we are humble working class professional and retired people some with children some raising grandchildren some own home some rent half the children at McKinley Elementary School are on free or assisted lunches we are economically and racially diverse as the rest of Salem maybe not more but we are equal on my particular street we have a close Community we walk we talk we bike we share fruits and vegetables we have a family from Ethiopia that has a group home that they live in provides care for disabled adults one woman teaches sewing classes in her home children attend Local Schools we have apartment buildings this is all still on the same street we have construction workers Hardware workers retirees retirees volunteer all over Salem just a block away as a Saint Francis family transitional housing over 20 units are there and they are awesome I personally volunteer with unhoused in the Salem area mentally ill disabled addicts warming shelters arches many are my former patients from the state I received the Willard C Marshall award in 2018 for my volunteer services Salem has many volunteers from scan all over Salem we care deeply about our city send in emails come to city council to testify are the voices of reason about livability in our community neighborhoods we Embrace progress we are passionate about our investments in this city we are also concerned about disruption to livability regarding the overlay zones we need careful thoughtful planning preservation of our neighborhoods throughout Salem this should be given a very high priority by Council and staff I respectfully ask council members to support our neighbors and neighborhood livability by retaining overlay zones in a 35 foot height limit thank you thank Peter burgo could I also add I'm a 35-year retiree of SEIU and I support the firefighters too good evening Mr Mayor members of the council my name is Peter bergel I live at 1850 Saginaw Street which is a property that's directly affected by staff's proposal to remove the zoning I recently had a conversation with counselor Stapleton in which he explained that her support for this proposal was based largely on Equity specifically she believes that greater density tends to be coupled with poorer access to services and therefore Equity demands that greater density be shared by all the neighborhoods and not just a few of them but there are other counterbalancing Equity issues involved here I understand that the city put the overlays in place originally when commercial was widened to assure that residents to the assured the residents then that the character of their residential neighborhood would not be degraded by tall buildings along Commercial Street those who have moved into the neighborhood since then including me have relied on that insurance the city's plan to now remove that protection as an injustice to those who currently live there and furthermore according to Suzanne H crowhurst Leonard a co-founder and director of the making cities livable International Council the construction industry is a powerful engine for fueling Economic Development tall buildings offer increased profits for Developers however the higher a building Rises the more expensive is the construction thus the tallest buildings tend to be luxury units offered for",

        "text": " the next cycle of plan development will begin from there so each utility involves interested people in their planning efforts to for you know to one degree or another and and those that that engagement while the utility is developing the plan is frankly as important as telling the puc what you think about the plan once it's completed so utility websites do detail opportunities for engagement at you know more and less technical levels there are certainly efforts by the electric utilities as required by HB 2021 to engage participants at a less technical level than we've been accustomed to maybe at the puc over the years so hopefully that is enough of an overview to get you interested and uh maybe we'll have the opportunity to provide more information going forward thanks thank you commissioner Decker and I appreciate um kind of correcting that notion that that uh the CPP is not just a DEQ effort but a really important part of your work as well so thank you for that and um kind of a good segue to this topic the commission the next topic on our agenda maybe before we go there Zach you can just put the agenda up quickly you can do a quick review so our next topic is renewable energy citing assessment then we're going to hear about work that the department of energy has been tasked with doing in terms of developing a forward-looking energy strategy we'll have a break and then kind of take stock of the legislative session and and how things played out in that session we're going to dig in on a draft work that we've put together with all the new requirements that the legislature has tasked the commission with leading as well as some of our ongoing responsibilities and kind of taking stock of that we'll take public comments and then just close with some next steps but the segue to the next topic is one that we've talked about for quite a while the importance of being able to vote to cite renewable energy well and efficiently as possible to meet our energy reduction emission reduction goals and this work that the department of energy and dlcd and others LED uh is I think a really important input to that need and so I'm excited this was adopted I think a year ago June and we've I've had it on my list of topics to get in front of the commission for quite some time so really excited to hear more about the work that the department of energy LED uh to help us think about how to be smart about renewable energy build out in the state so with that I'll turn things over to you Richie right can you all hear me okay we can uh good afternoon everyone um appreciate the invitation chair McDonald and members of the commission my name is Ruchi sedir and I am associate director for strategic engagement for the Oregon Department of energy and I'm joined today by my colleague Wally Adams and he's an analyst with the Oregon Department of energies uh facility sighting division which staffs the energy facility citing Council and he's going to be sharing screen and doing a live demo uh thanks again for the opportunity this um presentation is about the Oregon renewable energy citing assessment which was a multi-year project to help the state better understand opportunities and constraints around future renewable energy development um like the chair said you know this commission has Heard lots of presentations from different sources like the biennial Energy report even what um you heard from Cherry Decker a moment ago in terms of planning from um the utilities in terms of the significant renewable energy development that will be needed in the coming decades in order to meet our clean energy targets and requirements and you know I'm sure that you want the answer to that question but we're not actually going to directly answer that question of where all the new renewable energy development is going to go but we have assessed the landscape and we've built an online mapping and reporting tool to help so today you'll hear about the online mapping and reporting to as well as the companion report that goes with it and I want to be clear from the very start especially because these were policy topics that were raised in the most recent legislative session that this tool is completely voluntary to reuse it does not substitute for information that's submitted to Regulatory Agencies at counties or the state at fsec or permits required by um it's really not a substitute for those regulatory decisions that are made in the sort of evidence and record that those decision makers need it's voluntary to use um next slide please the project was funded through the U.S Department of Defense and it was approved by the legislature back in 2019 it closed in June 2022 but the tool continues to be maintained with up-to-date data um through our friends over at The Institute of Natural Resources at OSU and with that I just want to take a moment and thank our interagency team from Odo from from INR from Department of land conservation development Oregon Military Department um and the Department of Defense and navy and we also worked with other state agencies like the Oregon puc ODFW as well as local Federal and tribal governments we gained input from industry subject matter experts and Technical advisors as well as stakeholders across several sectors um next slide please related to our project goals I'll just highlight a few key points our project deliverable is considered discussion support and educational in nature our goal in partnering with DOD and our local military Liaisons was to support renewable energy compatibility through coordination and early notification which actually became a theme across a lot of other people you know staff at tribal governments and local governments that review renewable energy project proposals all wanted more coordination across government industry and and finally the other goal here I wanted to lift out is that our project was heavily driven by stakeholder feedback in order to create this sort of collection of trusted accurate information around renewable energy in Oregon which can become divisive um we knew that this was a tool that was completely voluntary to use and so we wanted its design and what was in it to be driven by what people need and want to think about these issues next slide so in this slide we've included the process for reference but I'm not going to walk through it in detail our core research was conducted through three consultant-led assessments and an agency-led citing procedures review and to gather the project involved more than 800 stakeholder touch points through one-on-one conversations surveys sector meetings and Regional webinars and our friends over at INR tell us that's actually one of the um highest number of stakeholder touch points they've ever had in developing a tool next slide please so a key deliverable for our grant our Federal Grant from DOD was a project report which is complementary to the online tool and the key takeaway from the report is that our project confirmed that there is enough renewable energy potential in the state to meet Oregon's energy and climate goals while acknowledging that there are trade-offs related to impacts and benefits with that development that would need to be evaluated through sustainable and responsible processes there were also takeaways around there being notable challenges to renewable energy resource development associated with transmission infrastructure as well as citing and permitting criteria and that criteria weighs policy and legal priorities I'm happy to come back to the report or set up follow-ups with any of you if you would like to dive into the report if there's interest next slide please the mapping and reporting tool is housed on Oregon Explorer and curated by Oregon State University libraries and Institute for natural resources to produce the tool our team reviewed more than 600 data sets and INR conducted significant user testing which again is their largest ever engagement and with that I'm going to pass it to my colleague Wally to do a live demo of the tool and if that doesn't work for some reason we'll come back to the slides because we do have some screenshots go ahead Molly thanks Richie um so I'll just go to this slide briefly this we're going to see this in a moment when I go to the tool and I guess I should stay for the record um Wally Adams I work for the Oregon Department of energy and the facility saving Division and I was part of the project team for Resa and the pleasure of working on the project and and helping with the tool development so without further Ado I'm going to switch over now to the browser and I'm just going to start here and this is actually odo's web page but you know if you're looking for the tool actually I tried this this morning if you just you know punch baressa into your Google search bar it'll be the first item that comes up but here's another way to find it is with our aressa page that's on odo's website and when you see this icon if you click here it'll take a few moments to load but you can see where we're moving to Oregon Explorer and it always takes a few seconds to load depending on your connection speed and then you'll get this menu that pops up there's three different parts to the tool there's the explore part which is where we're going to spend most of our time today get a report we'll we'll touch on that briefly the learn section has a lot of kind of backup information the report that Ruchi just mentioned is over here along with a lot of other kind of reference info if you want to check it out so I'm going to click on explore and then I'm actually I'm going to switch I've got another instance of this open it can take a few seconds sometimes for some of the data layers to to pull up so hopefully it'll be a little quicker because I've got some of this pre-loaded already um now that we're in here you can kind of see the basic layout we've got our map on the right and then we've got our list of data layers on the left and there are a lot of them there are hundreds of data layers in here it's uh the project team spent a lot of time identifying these and sorting through which ones would be you know the most useful for people who are interested in renewable energy siding and which were the reliable sources that we could count on over time um and we'll we'll poke into these a little bit but just you know highlighting the major categories you can see natural resource considerations there's a lot in here Community considerations oh I'll open that up a little bit later um and a lot of other data sets that are in here I want to start with military training areas we mentioned that DOD provided the funding for this tool and when I when I click here what you see in this kind of spaghetti that pops up these are military training routes that are over the state of Oregon most of us",

        "text": " ruchi put a link in the chat to earlier our strategic plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right hand side of the slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance our organizational data capabilities modernize our programs and really optimize efficiency at the agency luckily all of these seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe and the guidance documents around the iija including justice 40 and climate change and i will here pause for some questions from you all before we're going to launch a series of polls and ask some questions for you so remember to raise your hand or put a question in the chat if you have one about what we've talked about so far and i see that we have a question from sela i'm sorry if i didn't get your name right but i'll let you know when stacy's been able uh bring you off new there you go you can ask your question michael yeah hi janine thank you um yeah so i was not talking about that or asking about the 6.5 million dollar pot there was one slide that mentioned a a large amount of money and it sounded like maybe that was going to be at the federal level jen do you know which slide he's referring to uh yes it may be after we went through the six specific energy related ones that we know of there was a an overall slide that talked about i believe was a hundred billion dollars in additional investments that touch a broad array of things related to energy which may or may not be applicable to oregon there there are some highly specific grants in there and um some that may be good opportunities for us that we'll be watching as more information becomes available so that was that was a very large number at the federal level not not a number that oregon anticipates directly receiving and are those funds that oto would go after or would potential clients and projects go after it i i think it could be a combination of both just depending on the very specific details of the the federal funding stream requirements for each individual one um and some of those could be divided up into multiple types of competitions too at the federal level depending on on how usdoe chooses to to implement some of these funding streams okay thank you michael thank you for clarifying that um yes so i for those of you following the slides at home uh he's talking about slide 12 and that was sort of uh and here's all the other stuff we know about that we haven't talked about specifically in the previous slide so some of these may be odo may be eligible for some of them other agencies may be eligible for for some of them maybe things that uh organizations and businesses can pursue and i would um point you towards uh our website which i believe jen you can confirm has a link to a state website that really tries to boil down all these opportunities into a big spreadsheet yes the the statewide list is a link that you can find through odo's website and is uh hosted under on the oregon department of transportation's website so um let's see i'm not seeing any other questions in the chat so let's move on for now um and again this is where we are gonna start asking you some more questions underlying what we just discussed are values of efficiency effectiveness equity and transparency and this is really the essence of how we'll hope to work on these programs and funding streams we will aim for an efficient effective equitable and transparent use of resources however we recognize that natural tensions may arise in this process for example if we're presented with a valuable funding opportunity in which there are only 40 days to apply moto may struggle to keep the public fully informed um we'll do our best but we know how busy people are and and we just wanted to sort of highlight some of the trade-offs that might um come up between these so what we'd like to do is ask you all what would successful implementation look like odo helping to direct some of these federal funds to to benefit oregon and this is again a poll on the right-hand side of your screen where you can type in an answer it's not a it's not a click a box it's actually typing as odo strives for the most efficient effective equitable and transparent use of resources what would success look like we'll keep this one open for probably two minutes to give folks a chance to respond and as a reminder we can point you to the portal if you want to have more time to think through this and make a response all right we'll give folks about 20 more seconds to enter their responses all right stacy why don't you go ahead and close the poll there thanks to folks sorry if i cut anyone off remember that looks like we got some good responses looking at metrics like btus saved significant federal funds for oregon projects oregon related projects so making sure we get that federal funding here in the state ensuring rural areas don't leave money on the table providing updates especially if we can't get the the public comment in the time frame really appreciate these responses thank and i i see that we did have a question i missed from rebecca i think this is a question i don't know jen you or i could take it how for the competitive funds has oto thought about submitting comprehensive proposals with other stakeholders communities industry utilities is this even a possibility for the state and i think the answer is probably it depends on the application but certainly where there is an opportunity to partner we will look to do that jen do you have anything to add on that uh nope i think you you answered it wherever there's an opportunity for partnership it usually makes an application more competitive all right let's move on to the next so a core focus of the oregon department of energy's strategic plan is to ensure that we're working with a diverse range of stakeholders really having a meaningful and inclusive discussion about energy issues so throughout our process to apply for and implement federal funding we're going to prioritize this inclusive and our question for you today on this is given the limited time um and the limited capacity that we have how best can odo support inclusivity in design and or implementation of federally funded programs so again this is about inclusivity how can odo best support that as we go through this so i see stacy has opened the poll and we'll give you about a minute and a half great i see some responses coming in um let's go ahead and keep it open for another 20 seconds so consider this your 22nd warning all right please finish what you are typing and don't forget to press send and stacy go ahead and close out this great um so just going through a few of the importance of supporting rural area working with bipac organizations early to facilitate member and service group engagement more on the small rural utilities and lacking manpower to pursue these opportunities needing assistance variance in meeting application and funding requirements so a wider range of entities have access to funding taking a holistic view proactive outreach really great responses here and now i will turn back to jen for the next slide and the next question all right so we understand that applying for and managing federal funding involves uh several resource-intensive steps such as drafting an application collecting letters and once you're awarded uh tracking the project activities and reporting back to the either the federal granting agency or the entity that gave you the federal award understanding and administering federal funding can be very time intensive and difficult if you lack the capacity or expertise in this area on the other hand some other entities may already manage federal funding and are ready to sustain or expand this level of activity and implementation so our question to you is how can odo support communities that are applying for energy related funding under the and to go along with that we'll be opening up the poll but we're thinking about are there connections that we can help facilitate to help organizations find the expertise or skills that they and help organizations connect so that we can help fill in some of those potential capacity gaps all right poll is open and for those of you who talked in the last response limited capacity and ability especially in certain communities or in rural communities here's the place to tell us okay so how can we help we'll leave this one open for about two minutes thank you all right you've got about 30 more seconds to respond to this one okay please go ahead and wrap up your response and don't forget to press send when you're done and stacy go ahead and close out the thank you for these responses partnering with projects to solve their funding struggles to provide what they need in templates for example examples of completed application keeping everyone informed funding for third-party party contractors models sample applications great lots to work with here and i'll also highlight that we the agency has submitted a legislative concept that would establish a program at the department of energy to provide information about federal funding resources and other technical assistance rural tribal community-based organizations as they seek to apply for federal and state funding for these projects sort of acknowledging that um there is a capacity issue and a gap there so i'm i'm uh we will take some of the responses here and use that to inform um our efforts on that legislative concept as well all right next slide we also understand that the effort to bring in new people or new organizations to the level that is needed to manage federal funding is very time intensive and it's a high learning curve um as well as all the folks that may already be able to sustain that level of and so we've learned lessons as an agency from our past experience working with federal funds they're an amazing resource but the administrative aspects of federal funding cannot easily be overlooked with the responsibility to manage federal funds an organization needs a certain level of expertise and that expertise level grows if the proposed project involves construction which carries more federal requirements than other types of work so with that many of our jurisdictions or community based organizations could benefit from partnering with with other entities so at this point we just want to stop and get an assessment of what describes self-assessment of capacity to implement and administer federal funding at this point in time and so this is a quick poll to find out if you believe you have the capacity and expertise to implement and administer if you're unsure if you have the capacity and expertise or if you know right now that um you've got some gaps um related to the capacity",

        "text": " shared on the website in the background document so i'm not going to go into tremendous in a lot of this material some of it we talked about in the last meeting but to set the stage for the discussion i think it's worth um just recognizing some terms and um you know recognizing the the policy landscape within oregon within that document we've already developed a short list of known barriers as well as a short list of known and these lists are short because we haven't had this meeting yet and really what we want to get out of this meeting is to expand these lists of barriers and opportunities and dig in where where we can potentially overcome some barriers and potentially to unlock some other opportunities for project development in the future and especially where that development can bring to local communities this study is limited in in scope to up to 20 megawatts which in many oregon policies is referred to as small scale and so that's really where we're looking for these opportunities is um these smaller scale less than 20 megawatt projects that can bring some value to the to the and you know recognizing those values and seeing them as opportunities for development i think is part of what we want to do today we're not going to be talking about the 150 megawatt projects that are being you know across the west because those are just not in the scope of this project obviously those bring a lot of their own benefits to the to the bulk power grid but this is really about the small scale community based projects and trying to identify those opportunities and um and barriers associated with these projects and i believe we have a hand up we do i was just trying to figure out when to interrupt so yeah we have a college user with their hand up so linda could you meet that person um oh brook just got unmuted by accident but the call-in user lowered their hand some sort of confused um linda i think the call and user lowered their hand well there we go oh now broke it yeah there we go hi we have a person on the phone it looks like you wanted to it it was actually this is diane henkels it's no business utility advocates i've been actually on the phone since before nine i'm having problems and i've been listening but i've been having problems accessing the webinar and i had my hand up at that time to to work out the issues but so hand down i'm listening and i'll be accessing my webinar slowly thank you okay cool do you want us to contact you to see if we can help work out the problem like um like with the email or right i'll send you an email yeah i'll send you an email i'm gonna try to work it once more thanks you staying thanks diane and i don't know if it's worth elevating her to panelist in the meantime it sounds like she's going to be joining us you know through the through the webinar shortly keep an eye out for those for that hand being raised so alrighty so um within that background document we've identified a few terms um under policy considerations the policy landscape within oregon we talked about these in the last meeting so i'm not going to go into long definitions but i just want to bring up the list and recognize that we've added one from the last discussion and so before we talked about net metering and these are the customer sided projects that provide power on the customer's side of their electric meter and serve on-site loads and then we've talked about the public utility regulatory policies act or perpa and these are the projects that are not on the customer's side of the meter they're on the utilities side of the and are developed specifically to sell power to the utility and not use the power on site we talked a little bit about power purchase agreements which are similar to those perpa projects uh many of them are purple projects um these are projects that again um have specific contracts to sell their energy output in some cases other grid services directly to the utilities then there's direct access and this kind of works in the other direction this is where you may have a large industrial customer that wants to access a specific resource or a specific generator and support the development of a project that will be directly feeding into their industrial operations we have the community solar program when we say community solar program adding the word program i think entails um compute you know the oregon community solar program that is currently being implemented for the investor-owned but i do want to recognize that community solar has been happening in long before the program was developed and in many cases by consumer-owned utilities that are not actually participating in the the program that was developed by the legislature so we're going to be talking about some community solar projects and moving on to a couple that we didn't talk about before one is county and permitting is one of those barriers that um that represents um you know kind of a gate to for developers to check all their boxes to make sure that they're developing in a responsible manner and so most of the projects that we've seen so far in oregon especially those that have already been have been the size that could be permitted by the county and we've had recent legislation that have changed thresholds from where the county does the permitting to where the um energy facility siting council does the and the counties have a much larger swath of jurisdiction following the last round of legislation and they have the full jurisdiction over these small-scale projects and these thresholds are based on the acreage of a project and so um what we see for a county permitting is that they are responsible um you know permitting these projects that are up to 20 megawatts and in most cases those are not going to trigger the state permitting process but we will see in our first presentation that sometimes you run into some federal barriers as well and so we'll keep those in mind as we go and then the other thing that we added were the oregon statewide land use planning goals and we just provided a brief background there are i believe 13 goals and one of them has to do with energy but it really doesn't have to do with energy development on oregon lands it's a it's a land use goal that was i believe in 1974 that that goal 13 was uh was not written with the idea that oregon could be generating a significant share of its own electricity and so we're going to talk a little bit about these land use planning goals there's another another goal that is often referenced um goal 3 is related to the preservation of agricultural lands and is often cited when projects are proposed you know solar or other renewable energy development posed on agricultural lands so um we'll talk a little bit about these statewide land use planning goals and talk about whether or not with with the county permitting and the land use goals if there are any recommendations that the work group may want to make moving on we have a few other policy considerations that are recognized in the document and these are policies that are trying to present an opportunity and so these are a little more opportunity based than barrier based and there are programs that are essentially trying to streamline the process for for for developing and administering these projects fee in lieu of property taxes is one that is familiar with a lot of county permitting folks this is where can work you know enter into an agreement with a county or other taxing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a centralized assessment which is a very administratively burdensome process and so the fee in lieu of property taxes provides a streamlined way for a solar project to pay property taxes based on the capacity of the project and the payment ranges from fifty five hundred to seven thousand dollars per megawatt of capacity and it's a it's a very simple simple math approach to establishing property taxes for projects and what we found in a lot of rural eastern oregon where land may not have a lot of property tax value is that these these fees provide significant income streams for you know property tax income streams for the local jurisdictions there's also a number of policies that are designed either to attract jobs and economic development like the renewable energy development zones identifying certain reaches within the where they believe that development would be most beneficial renewable portfolio standard this is our house bill 2021 made some significant changes to that where oregon is now you know targeting 100 percent carbon-free electricity and so that is presumably also going to present opportunities for developing projects in state and then there are a number of programs that are designed to provide financial incentives the community renewable energy grant program was also established in house bill 2021 it's currently open for applications and this one really gets at these community scale renewable energy the definitions of community and small scale and that program line up with this it provides grants for planning projects it provides grants for constructing projects up to a million dollars and that program um is only open to public entities so it's really trying to forge these partnerships within communities you know these community driven projects working with the local municipality or school district and there are a there's a whole long list of entities that can be considered public bodies in that program and i can't tell if someone was trying to get in with the question was there a i see paula has a hand raised and i don't know if maybe paula is a mute or if um if maybe hi can you hear me yes thank you i i just wanted to add that another funding source that is available is c-pace commercial property assessed clean energy it's available in both multnomah and deschutes county and it's a program that any other county could opt into and i don't know if you'd like me to elaborate on it or if you're familiar with it rob but it's certainly something that could be added to this list definitely yeah we would love to add that to the list and maybe if you could give a a very brief you know one minute summary of what the program and we will make sure it gets added to the to the background documents that go into the report i'd be happy to it's a expansion of the federal tax assessment process similar to a local improvement it allows commercial property owners to use the special assessment process to finance renewable energy energy efficiency water conservation ev charging ev charging and backup storage it has popcorn across the country over the last 13 14 years as states in abel see pace and then counties adopted and oregon enabled this program in 2015 multnom",

        "text": " they may have project descriptions or rules that get to that which is where I think those things come in um um the last bullet I'm fine with um include local jurisdictions and local voices well okay let's make sure counties are talked about too okay and the reason that I was I was imagining okay you're going to have these this framework these framework Concepts but I think it would also be helpful to have um short multi- pager I don't care if it's a two-pager or a four page brochure that has this since every county is different right we know here in Washington County we have a County Road system within the urban area and we have a County Road system in the rural portions of our community that are different than the county road systems in Moma County right very few clus County does have have a County Road system though AR is just of a different magnitude and then we also need to work with our city colleagues to represent the enormity of the neighborhood street networks that they have or that exist here throughout the whole collection of 13 or so cities in Washington County um whether that's a small table That You Do by City with a cumulative hole at the bottom including a role for urban unincorporated Washington County and the reason why I think a one pager like this really will be useful especially for the Washington County delegation is because of the way that the the big in our state has as many State reps and Senators as we have for all of Washington County right and things tend to get over oversized uh relative to the city of Portland including for any any gains that Metro advocates for um at the state legislature so we really have to lead with a a set of Concepts that accomplish what the county needs from a state system and a state funding program but also ensure that we have that education tool for what is the system here in the entirety of Washington County and I think that's one way where we um also are able to give voice to our local cities uh as well um my last one on process is this including a transparent and inclusive cost and benefits analysis to understand tradeoffs um this is one of those places where uh the conversations around tolling have been particularly informative of these words but um the hardest part we have as a as a staff in in how we get information out of the state is like what did they look at what information are they using to Balan policies so having that transparency within the process helps us know what expectations are of us and when they allocate whatever funding source it is to a project what of their cost benefits have they looked at and how are they communicating with us um so I have no problem with this being refined to say processes for projects okay um what ultimately I'm really hoping for is that the 2025 legislature will exercise leadership and uh Advance a revenue story that stops just exploring alternative funding uh and actually um so and and exercises the leadership and uh because we need it and if they don't do it in 25 uh than in 27 or 29 because the systems creator in yeah I think part of one of the reasons why this framework coming from the board is incredibly important is it tells our legislators that's our expectation starting now that they prepare and get their Ducks ordered or at least identified um so that we can have this conversation before the 2025 session um and we have some members of our delegation who are already jazzed for this conversation but more need more and I think hearing from you through this document this is what we care about start talking about it get your people get the county what they need so that we can serve people so that brings me to um the point that under desired outcomes uh I think both Commissioners Rogers and Willie spoke to this a little bit and I'm not sure that we've connected it up in our framework concept uh on desired outcomes that our interest is not only with the counties and the cities within but our connections with the state system and I was thinking of regional transportation system includes connectivity but I don't think that that's partly because I spent 12 years as a Metro counselor and so that's a mistake on my part I think we do need to um recognize that we don't function as an island we are reliant upon that state system and the state connectivity uh so somehow weave that in to the desired outcomes commissioner T how you doing I'm here did I miss it any raised hands or were you able to plug in nope I'm I'm doing fine I'm I'm still just absorbing some of this but um I first of all I guess what one thing I do want to say is I'm appreciate that the gr group has worked on this whole framework and we have the opportunity to weigh in here I I I don't want to miss that point I think I think it's really a great straw man if you will that we are uh working with so thank you I would say it's the Lut team sorry and then a little bit of gr so sorry sorry Stephen sorry Stephen so as you switch to this uh yes I think you're hearing from the Commissioners that we would like to see the development of that tool I wrote down a few closing statements or closing thoughts for myself um that I'll share now I've watched the video from the October 24th work session and I thought you had some good conversation but one point concerned me and that was the idea that there were guiding principles was sort of lost through some of the conversation and I think our staff tried to remind us that this this upcoming session when you were talking about the agenda for this up coming session particularly when I heard of a new project example I was like wait a minute no this isn't the time for new policies for this session to say you're interested in something to frame up in in 2024 leading to 25 is one thing so we've got to think about our own discipline uh as a board on on this the other uh another point I wanted to make um and I didn't weave it into any of Concepts Revenue neutral is not sufficient if the state legislature in 2025 just ends up with a formula where it's the same amount of money we're going backwards so I was going to say Revenue neutral is wrong but um where do you see Revenue neutal it doesn't I think that the chair is suggesting another principle that should be out there is that this not this package in 2025 should not be Revenue neutral it should in fact enhance the revenue completely agree we need to expand the revenue yeah right we need to advance the system by new neutral is just taking it out of my pocket and putting it in yours yeah this is not going to be enough and the other thing is I have a lot of respect for the Trucking Association and the fact that products and services move with big rigs all the way to delivery Vans but this claim that any change to for example weight mile is um uh the sky gonna fall it just is a nonstarter for me it's um because nothing is free um and their use does have impact on the system as well so um they're going to be pulling massively in the don't change anything because we want to pay less not more but their trucks have to get around too and their service Vehicles so uh they have to be at the table don't get me wrong um but I see there there are just some false choices that get teed up um in domain so next steps uh yeah I didn't include a next step slide which is very unlike me um I think next steps are to continue the conversation with is a few one-on ones making sure that we've heard things correctly um have those comprehensive conversations and staff will work on drafting an actual framework so you can see what it looks like with all of this conversation wrapped into it and then come back at a work session in the future seeing if we can fit it into agenda setting one but that might get really long really fast and nobody wants that it's going to be a complicated day um but we will find a time we have January to get through this but the sooner we can this is a good start in the conversation so I don't go too far a field when uh lobbyists or legislators ask me questions I can say I have a board meeting you should listen to point I'm back here um but we will check back in once we have something drafted and continue the conversation to see if there's a moment where we we can actually adopt it um so that we can present it to our our legislature and guide staff in these conversations great I would like to take a moment to highlight that we the board have a uh logistical problem um so I appreciate the fact commissioner Rogers that you've noted here we are the middle of the um but group we have a problem M we made a choice to change our meeting times from 8:30 to 9: to accommodate commissioner fi's need to drop kids off of school I believe her drop off schedule has changed though we have not reverted back because of that change from 8:30 to 9 it means that we don't ever schedule a topic before the 10 o'clock it may also mean that looking at next year we need to think about either spit splitting our business meetings out to another day or having them in the afternoon and keeping our work sessions in the fresh part of the day um uh I'm also quite disheartened that our transportation representative has chosen to leave early today um and has missed out on the culmination of this uh conversation so that is a problem too um so so um this isn't a problem that is just mine to solve uh it has been coming up more and more over these last few months so um we need to spend some time uh in perhaps our December Roundtable to figure out what we're going to do either we're going to be conscious and at somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 take a break so that we can get to the work that we need to do uh or make some other adjustments um frankly I don't know how to tee that up with Alternatives I'm just going to leave it as an agenda item that we have to talk about um but here we sit for a five uh prepared to have work session at least until 4 um and we have what we have I think it's a valid point that you make that um under this structure we can't get to any of these",

        "text": " so from a informed decision argument uh yeah if the owner knows the source energy or excuse me the source emissions involved with a particular choice that that would I think that'd be very helpful from a site energy or site standpoint that would just be an electrification measure because electricity doesn't have any site emissions but it does have Source emissions and that wouldn't be a uh informed decision on the part of the owner okay yeah thanks Kevin uh Ben yeah along a similar line I do think it's helpful to the program to include that uh since you know the stated goals are are to reduce emissions but uh getting back to what we're doing with the rest of the standard and how it's based on on site energy use this one statement if we leave it in and and wipe out all the other greenhouse gas targets is kind of Island and I I don't know like taken out of context like that and you know unless we provide some kind of alternate compliance path that takes emissions into account I don't know that that's particularly useful for the owners I'm personally inclined to leave it in though is that is again the stated goal of this program even though we're not specifically targeting okay yeah thanks Ben uh Vin I'm thinking about um Washington State and then Seattle's new carbon performance standards I think they call them building emissions performance um so since the city of Seattle is looking at decarbonization and the state is looking at energy reduction um and as I understand because State preemption we have some similar issues here in um places like Portland and the overall state of um not being able to where local jurisdictions can't simply um they don't have the home rule authority to um have their own Energy Efficiency standards so carbon is the pathway uh so I think thinking as cities like Portland and others move forward on to meet their climate goals I think it'd be helpful for owners to have the decarbonization assessments um now for with the state they have a sense of you know if this is going to happen at the local level as it as Seattle's kind of has done with Washington um I think if those decarbonization assessments have done in Washington ensure that it's it's helpful to all the folks in Seattle similarly all the folks in Portland right now whove reported commercial building since 2015 have a leg up on on um getting ready for the the state's building performance standards so I I'm inclined to say it's beneficial to have it in um I don't see there's a future where we aren't thinking about carbon generally and so this I do think it's different than a ghgi Target where it's just here's the you know here here's how you could decarbonize too I also wanted to speak to site versus source eui so uh we use site eui uh reported to portfolio manager at the city of Portland and uh that does include electricity um so there's a a greenhouse gas emission factor that is included in the side eui it's based on kilowatt hours consumed um so there there definitely the side eui does include that uh there's a multiple reasons why we don't use Source eui um and so we're really getting into the building level of intervention not necessarily at the generation level intervention that's one main reason but also I I think there's inconsistency consistency on source eui so there's L loss of energy um in transmission lines that are included with source eui and um you know if we include that something that we we don't see on source cui is the the loss of methane along natural gas lines and um and methan being a something like 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gas I think is um we're it's I don't feel like we're doing it an Apples to Apples comparison if we look at source UI yeah thanks thanks Finn um okay well yeah I appreciate the comments on that on the decarbonization assessment piece we'll definitely take those into you know into account as we as we move forward it sounds like there's overall maybe some interest in kind of keeping that in even if it's not a a like a direct explicit component of meeting the organ BPS but that it um it aligns with the overall goal the stated goals of the BPS the legislation and that it could potentially help inform future um local uh BPS like what's potentially moving forward in Portland so um let's see moving yeah kind of moving down this line so if you don't meet the performance Target qualified energy auditor needs to complete an audit according to Section 8 Energy Efficiency measures that reduce energy use to meet the target shall be implemented according to section n and then upon completion the building shall be granted conditional compliance with um with those so it kind of the conditional compliance pathway is one where you can if you don't meet the target but you've identified measures and you do the measures but the measures haven't had enough time to actually be in place yet to document a full Year's worth of energy reductions there's this conditional compliance timeline um so I did want to oh Alex yeah you know I I don't know now I can't find my notes but I was curious and maybe this is somewhere else once you on a conditional compliance pass how do you get back to a compliance and whether that potentially needs some clarification how a building once that it's on unconditional compliance path can um remedy that and get back into full compliance yeah that that is kind of later on but um you know essentially the pathway there would be documenting an eui that meets the target okay and that's L that's laid out how that how that works yeah you know because you want to sure right that that conditional compliance buildings are still working towards getting into full compliance yeah cool thank you thanks so I did want to to add to kind of maybe spend some time discussing this one too um so for more recently built buildings um and this is a pathway that is in the Washington standard where Washington essentially requires that more recently built buildings meet a Target that's 15% more efficient um than the other than other buildings um you know we're still limited for the um the targets to be at the most as stringent as the average eui um but essentially Washington provides a a different separate and a little bit more stringent requirement for newer buildings um to have to meet a Target that's 15% more efficient and if they if they don't meet that 15% more efficient Target but they do meet the the standard eui Target for that building type um there's still a pathway that they can use to implement commissioning measures in order to document and show conditional compliance so I just I wanted to point point this one out um and and just kind of explore the the opportunity or the need to include a pathway like this in Oregon or if um there's also the potential just to to treat U you know all buildings the same regardless of of when they were built um you know I I think any new building that's built to the Oregon energy code within the last you know few Cycles um is going to be a you know especially now um is going to be a very efficient building already and um in just about all cases I I think would have no trouble meeting a BPS um I'm I'm sure there are going to be some cases where a new building just due to the way it's operating or the way that it's um you know its energy intensive features um perhaps doesn't meet an eui Target where that exists um and I think that's something we'll kind of have to think about how that how that building might um you know might be able to comply but um you know that so that's always the option is to kind of treat all buildings the same whether or not it's a new building or or an old building or should we have a more stringent requirement for newer buildings because they're built to a more stringent code um Kevin looks like you have a raise hand yeah thanks Blake I'm I'm just doing the conceptual math here so if if the legislation says that the target can't be more stringent than the then this section I think you'd have to have a target for everyone else that's 15% worse than the average that's that's right yeah so it would a new building would only be able to have a more stringent Target where the uh yeah where the target for that building type wasn't at the average because we still can't go beyond the average got okay that makes sense yeah so if it turned out that the Target that we set for a specific building um is not at the average which you know we we haven't we we'll be going through that Target setting uh procedure soon um it would only be available for or applicable if the targets aren't quite at the average yeah gotcha okay makes sense yeah know yeah your math is is H is tracking there Alex yeah essentially following up on that I think that means uh since since we're currently um anticipating that all buildings have to meet the average uh we would you know exclude buildings if we would require only new buildings buildings to meet that average and other and all other buildings less so I'm I'm in favor with rather you know the broader approach that all buildings have to meet the average since that's the the ceiling that's allowed in the okay yeah thanks Alex um then and just to follow up on my thought oh sorry jumping ahead there um I I thank you uh I I know we haven't defined that what these numbers are yet and and I guess I'm not sure how that's even going to happen I I I think like uh like was just suggested the average would be the standard but I suppose there could be a particular building type that for whatever reason isn't the average that that the target would be higher um I'm not sure where that would be the case but maybe there's a compelling reason for that and then then the section could come into play like you're were describing but uh yeah otherwise I I tend to agree I think the average is probably we're shooting for but I don't know that's a very complex process I know that has yet to be done so yeah cool thank you yeah thanks Kevin Vin yeah I think we'll get to part of this later when we start thinking about like buildings that don't really have an average like convention centers um but um in the meantime I'm just generally I I really like this approach I'm imagining from Washington of having commissioning which is really you know much higher level of intervention than just an energy audit and identify EMS because if a new newly constructed building and this isn't always going to be true but generally a newly constructed building isn't performing as well",

Jasper has an interesting history he worked as a member of the State Highway Department beginning in 1913 and he had become the chief maintenance engineer in 1932. he actually died fairly young he died at the age of 52 and in November 1941 all flags on Highway Maintenance shops throughout the state were flown at half-mast until after his funeral you can see a Sanborn fire Insurance a map there this resource again is contributing to Salem skating ambushes past your apartment has a high level of Instagram so this is a site plan which gives an overview of The Proposal that you're going to be reviewing tonight the applicant is requesting a Google to replace its own with eight windows on the second story of this residence please do not function properly some have been heated shut and the sash counterweights have been cut the windows are all single pain and also let the golden heat in the applicant is also proposing to replace the shingle siding just on the dormers on the front facade of the bishop house a little bit more specifics about the proposal on the North facade which is the front the applicant is proposing to replace the existing windows with custom designed wood double upon Windows designed by state with Windows and the cedar shaped shingles will be replaced with any kind Cedar shapes shingles to match the existing and on the secondary facades of the applicant is proposing uh I'm just going to take one this out at a time some of the West facade there are three double Windows on this decide that they're proposing to replace with three paintable fiberglass double pane Marvin Elevate double fun Windows within the existing openings on the south which is the rear there are two uh existing windows on the Second Story with which the Africans were proposing to replace with the same type of window the Marvin elevate a paintable fiberglass product and then on the East facade we can just see the interior view here same kind of thing replacing the existing window with a paintable fiber now I'm going to go through the applicable guidelines which are in Salem Revised Code src-23065 so the first guideline relating to use the applicant's not proposing to alter the original produces a single family and the overall builds are closed siding and weather replacement on the primary facade is an in-kind replacement matching material and design of the original double Chrome windows and the siding out the sighting on the Dormers is also going to be in kind thereby meeting SRC 23065 uh C and D the proposed replacement windows while a change in material is proposed with Windows on the secondary facades the administration pattern and window openings will be uh in this world cup um to improve both functionality and Energy Efficiency while ensuring that the overall character-defining features of the openings are retained the proposed new double foam fiberglass windows are paintable and match the design of the original windows and their location on the side and rear facades of the resource minimizes any adverse visual impacts due to the change in material therefore staff recommends that a Salem Revised Code 23065 has been met for the proposal specifically guidelines f and g the guidelines each relating to structural deficiencies and excavation and recreating uh are not applicable to the evaluation of this purpose you have received testimony in support of public comment from Mark his stand and also an email from John Christensen from the scan parks and Gardens Resort committee which should be on your desk and this evening today as well um City departments uh building and safety indicated that building permits for the window and siding replacement are not required for single family dwelling unless the structures closer than three feet for other structure and the planning division Public Works and fire departments is not having concerns with the proposal staff recommends that the historic landmarks commission approved the proposal based upon the applicants submittal and the findings presented in the staff report do any of the Commissioners have commissioner sorry um just one clarifying question um I see the picture in the email attachment the bottom of the window is not matching the design but that's just an example is that right it's going to be matching on the secondary facades yeah that's correct that's just an example from the application is question for the applicant um so if you don't have any other questions for staff then I will now call for the applicant's testimony please state your name and address for the record order business address uh my name is um Cheryl proposes to uh just replace the windows that are not functioning up on the second level and we would want to keep the same look uh make it more efficient and provide better Energy Efficiency and allow her to be able to increase the windows so that would take care of this but we're going to keep the same work an answer to your question about the bottom the samples just didn't have that uh is um could you talk a little bit more about the condition of the existing windows and why they're not fixable uh they're they've been painted overshadowed quite often or a few different times uh the strands that hold the counterweights of the mix and windows function they have been cut so it's pretty extensive to be able to pull those spaces off and try to restore those if we did they still would be a single thing and no so it would not allow Information Systems herself she has a lot of heat and cold from the summer and Winters and so it's just not very efficient of those work on the Energy Efficiency um we haven't that would uh not really allow her to use the windows as intended if they have just a sort of outside plus it would be harder to put those on and off being at the second level I did so as do you get the first floor in this place previously uh Richard yeah thank you commission Department um are you planning on keeping the frames inside the wood frames and stuff and just focusing the window insert the truth that sequences to face the street whoever plan to just do the sash so that would be taking this apart and then using the new sashes which would keep the original frame that's our understanding of the Historic Society would prefer that the only way we would change if there was some structural issue or some kind of dragline that requires to choose that but other other than that is is there potential that you could find someone as you're dismantling it's always potential but uh Windows seem to be that the framing of the houses that seems to be in very good shape so if we have to do anything like that it would be just to restore everything back to the original so no shape to the windows would change or size-wise thank you do you have any other questions yeah uh do you think you could talk a little bit about the comparison of work between replacing the window and fixing the window I think I'd like to have a little bit more clarity well the main thing is that the windows are not energy efficient so by changing them out to it anything that is a dual pane um Argon gas in the center for insulation that will allow her to have a better pencil on the the efficiency of the windows the temperature that stays upstairs it's the next the next Second Story window so level so it does tend to get hotter in the summertime if there's not that efficiency so that's why we're looking more at replacing those windows because there's not more than a way to make them efficient and also make them operate correctly any other questions and I will offer uh is there anyone here representing the neighborhood there's none I won't help any other testimony and I don't think we have anybody else signed about to speak do you have any additional questions of and I will now close the public hearing no additional testimony will be accepted at this time without formally reopening the year I will now call for a motion as you can possible commissioner approved as recommended in second is there's any discussion oh do we need to do we have sorry do we have any discussion uh yeah I'd like to make a plan great um I have a few concerns just about the windows especially on the front facade it sounds like the main motivation behind changing those materials out is Energy Efficiency and I just don't know if that meets the for historic materials um it seems like there may be a chance to preserve more care if the window rather than replacing it um so I'd like to maybe talk about that criteria a little bit before we approve ments for discussion follow-up question to you and um so the material the replacement material is in kind with",

        "text": " get the money to do it um you know but I but I like the idea of building like the the May Parts into it um and I think that would help may maybe it would kind of help the industry to uh to almost kind of enforce itself in a lot of ways you know like if um you know if if there happens to be a you know a certain organizations that aren't or you know individuals that aren't performing um high quality audits then you know maybe the rest of the industry can help identify that too so um yeah looks like Rick along the same lines I was going to ask if the are the reports themselves submitted to you all uh yes there would be yeah um I didn't know if there's maybe it's not in the rules maybe it's program admin but the sharing back out with any other I don't know like you said industry Partners um I know there's other uh report outs like the utilities get on like home energy scores and things like that where we can engage and do followup and see Trends and kind of help be a supporting partner in some of those aspects so I don't know if that's an area um it's useful inform for us as well for planning and knowing what customers are going to do to change their energy usage or what they could do so one idea of there's probably a lot of a lot of rules around the data sharing but could be an opportunity right yeah I I I do imagine that there might be some like some audits might contain confidential data and um potentially things like that that could be a challenge with making them publicly available but yeah it's a good but then also you could if you are getting them and have any sort of Data Tracking um you know you could see that if there's an auditor who results in lots of exceptions and no projects going through that could get flagged somehow I'm yeah the last thing you mentioned Rick just um is reminding me of an overall concern with the savings exception that um implementing compliance might be a challenge so if ifo let's just say that folks realize like oh this is the best forward because one you get an energy audit but two you might find a um the most cost-effective pathway and that's why it's set up this way to comply um that may or may not reduce an and um how how would Odo know let's just assume like a 100% of folks choose this pathway this exception right because there's nothing stopping that as far as I can tell and so how would Odo assure that um the goals of the policy are being met if the result is they have this audit and here's here's the recommendations come out of it and then I will Implement that in some amount of time it would be like reviewing back to where the eui is later would they still eventually need to come back to the eui or is it just pretty much like as long as you get the audit you get the recommendations and find out your own timeline to implement then you're good to go from here until whenever I mean it just seems like it's a very e it's by far the easiest pathway forward that might not get the results that the legislation is um yeah I mean I think that that's our concern too that that you know I you audits commercial building audits aren't necessarily cheap um to do but you know in some cases that might be like the the cheapest Pathway to hire somebody to do an audit um and you know document that there aren't any cost- effective measures that can be implemented and then they submit through the investment criteria and um you know that becomes their compliance pathway at least for that cycle um you know that's our concern too that if you know 100% or a significant percentage of the building owners choose that were to choose that pathway then we wouldn't actually see any eii reductions as a result of it um you know I think we'd have a hard time believing that there aren't any cost-effective efficiency measures out there um but um you know it's I don't know yeah I don't know what else to say other than that's it's a concern that we have as well in terms of like how to verify to verify that and not achieving the what we think are going to be the benefits of the BPS program and reduce energy usage or or they're implemented in a way that's not really making much of a difference um I'd be curious to hear from others who are maybe closer to energy Audits and um any ideas on how to enforce that the energy audits actually result in and measure measures that are reducing um energy use or at least improving Energy Efficiency because I know that of course within like volun when people are doing it voluntarily they're their intention they already have like a reason to go and you whether it's carbon emissions or to look better for energy star scores within the market or to reduce their own energy bills like they have the reasons but then when it's mandated as a government kind of you have to do this I I have less confidence I guess that that um the end result will be achieved yeah thanks for the comments V I don't know if anyone else has any other follow-ups or insights there but it's it's it's definitely something that as program implementation occurs that we'll be you know keeping an uh doing our best to keep an eye on um like what percentage of the buildings are are you know going using the investment criteria pathway and you know doing an audit and of those you know how many are documenting lots of good Energy Efficiency cost effective measures and how many are just coming up with little or no cost-effective measures and and using that as the as the compliance um we'll definitely be wash you know that's something that we've heard about as concern in in the other jurisdictions of BPS to and well as those jurisdictions come into compliance as their compliance timelines kick in we'll be interested in kind of watching what what happens there um too one more thought on this BL from me Clark um yeah is that I just think this idea of a credible threat of an audit of the audit especially if it's potentially it could either bu Odo or by one of their industry peers because my experiences is that industry peers don't like to um they don't like to have their other industry peers tell them that they' made mistakes and so if you really believe there's a credible chance that the work you're doing is going to get reviewed by either Odo directly or one of your peers um you're probably going to has up in your pencil and do a job that can survive that audit um and you know whether you use the US gbc's model or the irs's model it just seems like the key is it has to be a credible threat so a few people do need to get audited every year to make sure everyone knows that's actually happening but it wouldn't necessarily have to be a lot it's things like yeah and Clark do you think that could be achieved just by adding some language into the like the audit chapters that just points to like the potential for Odo to audit the submittal we see I think the word potential would not I think be helpful to say uh you know a certain number and it could be a pretty small percentage it seems like you could do some research but you know whether it's one% but some number of submissions every year will be audited either by Odo or a trained certified auditor certified by the program right um yeah and that and that will it seems like if you use the language that will happen that to me would create a lot more um Clarity for people in terms of as they're making their calculus decision here yeah as opposed to the potential of that's my opinion what do others think yeah I mean I do see some um you know someone made a comment about adding language say there's potential audit for submissions that then Montgomery County Maryland has reserved the right to reject audits life cycle cost um so that might be something that we could look look at too um yeah I you could certainly add it to the rules Blake and you could also yeah put it on any of the forms that you're using or you know website information or you know yeah yeah yeah that could be useful to look at and thinking about this is like five year kind of time frames right so um if there were in addition to the audit itself if there's an indication that a certain number percentage will be um that Odo will spend part of their resources to assure that um that the uh the the measures are you know meeting the criteria within the Miss trade rules so like as you're mentioned CL like audit of the audit and then on top of that to have a revisiting like the same thing like and then every year another 10% will be reviewed to assure that there is actually implementation and I think that's the part that I'm kind of wondering most mostly about is one is it's the quality of the initial audit but then there's also what's the followup for implementation if there's kind of a pass on eui or am I missing something here that there's actually a confirmation method to assure that measures are implemented in a timely manner um well I mean I think the I mean it's probably would be part of their implementation plan like their energy management plan but I mean they could still delay it like for to the point of um like equip at the end of equipment's useful life um if it doesn't line up and but I mean one one feedback loop would be the next time that they come to report their like their energy use we could see like if they were supposed to have done an audit that was going to save x amount of energy um it and they identified some cost effective measures in there it should be reflected in their next um you know in their in their gradual successive years of energy so that's a good idea yeah um I did have one oh just uh um Clark I I I love the idea of committing Odo to uh to reviewing either Odo or you know Contracting out with a third party to review audits my only concern there is just um like dedicating a budget to something that we don't have the budget for yet you know I'd love to include it in in the rul making um but if it's not something that like we're certain of is going to be in our future budgets then we're kind of tying our own hands there in in some ways um understood then then I think you can just work with doj on the best language around potential or uh whatever was",

        "text": " that we have right now and then we'll see if there's any other information or questions that people have but I have a Brian Millard it's Brian in the room taking that okay how about a Brian with a c right and C so I'm just wondering how does this benefit mean so if you don't mind can you come up so we can get you on the so if you can state your name the life is on if you do want to comment or ask a thank you so you want my name sure uh Brian um so I'm just wondering how this benefits me the Atlanta um I know you said that it will something goes out a little safety net but what do I bet what do I get out of you guys are putting lines over my property big towers next to my coffee how does this help me so when you're asking for specific benefits that ensuring that the grid won't get interrupted and power flow won't get interrupted that is the benefit that is going to be seen by the landowners um beyond that there isn't a dramatic a benefit to a landowner to have lines over their properties um so it's just the continued flow of power so uh have you guys done research on how this affects property value we haven't as a company done specific research but we get this question quite a bit and the only answer and it's not satisfactory that I can give is if you look on the internet uh there have been studies that have supposedly been done and what they indicate and what you'll find is some of the studies will say it has no impact some will have say that it has some slight impact on costs and other studies will say that all it impacts is a time or fail but as a company we haven't done any studies ourselves well you you study the word is that not a concern are you good we don't we won't we don't plan to do any studies to determine a true impact on property value for the existence of lines what about health or you're referring to EMF electromagnetic forces those have been studied and again the we get this question on most of these public comment periods or through the public comment periods and it may not be a satisfactory answer but we construct our lines in a manner to reduce the EMF down to a signal that's below any of that of any association with any human health concerns so we feel that based on the studies that are out there based on scientific data our EMF drops off dramatically with distance and so even with a linear source of EMF if your transmission line is signal drops off the square in the business so what what that's saying to you is the power of that EMS signal drops off dramatically and we have done our own tests through Consultants to find that you will have EMF signals in your home uh heating blankets are some of the highest they provide a much greater EMF signature than you deal with during the winter than you'll ever see Federal from a transvest in regards to nice uh let alone humans who's not just a mistake that we have animals we have cattle feed goats chickens there's no yeah no effects to any life I mean an animal no no no no effects said no dangerous effects that's the way based on everything that we've known and all the data that we've seen there is no effect on that EMS has that's a group of yes all of that has to be considered um and the maintenance of our right away has to be such that that fire dangers reduced down to the level that it is some of you may be seeing where now we're telling people that we have uh power being turned off in remote areas where when the winds and the temperatures get to a certain time during the summer fire danger we're doing preemptive line uh de-energizations so all that has to be considered as part of Mobile broadnecks you can keep going uh I can tell you that I know I truly understand it's not a joyful part of my job to go to a property you want to tell them I have to build mines over their house or you know we're never going to build over your own um so the only thing I can tell you is that some of my answers are not going to be satisfactory to you no matter what I say I'm aware of that I'm not going to try to assemble or try to trick you you're going to be straight up because I'm I'm gonna get caught if I tried to lie so ask anything you just you may not be satisfied with the answer but don't be afraid to ask it it's important to you so it's important yeah I have three sons um so if you were to have a property with lines going over your wallpaper where your kids will play it would you let your kids play out there yes I I have I have house uh with lime serum both transmission and distribution and I have no problem with them playing near a substation I mean I work in them all the I don't feel the least bit threatened by him I have no health effects I can tell you that there are no studies out there that indicate Electrical Workers have a higher incidence of any other type of Health effect that non-electrical non-electrical workers have and they're around power lines and Transformers and substations every day all the time during their own these uh are they just gonna come under our property and do surveys or are they going to contact us ahead of time how do you go ahead and throw them out we're you're notifying some of you may have already been being notified about some surveys that have been going on so yeah we're not just gonna just show up one day and without your permission start walking on your property or sending out mailers they're making phone calls ahead of surveys and uh they should be knocking on doors if uh if it's a residential Community or property where there's homes or somebody that's clearly living there we should be knocking on the door or leaving a hanger letting you know what's happened and what we're doing and why so no one should ever just be showing up on your property and the reality is if they show up and you don't want them on your property you tell them not to go and they should not force them force their way onto your property so the surveys are all done with your permission and if you don't give permission then the surveys won't happen on your problem um is there any compensation to put in there isn't compensation for the surveys but when the process gets to the point where we're requesting easements from you if the line's going nearer on your property there's compensation for them a conversation enough between a fix the the value of my house or the things it's like a pocket change so the right-of-way process is uh it's a give and take or go back and forth however you want to say it the way that makes it it's a the way it works from the we have a fiduciary responsibility to our rig pairs so we're not like a solar farm that's the big thing everybody tells us is solar farm just came and offered me nine times the value because they want to put a solar field on my front I can't do that I can't just offer you that kind of money because I'm obligated to ensure that I'm keeping costs as low as possible for the rates for the other rate payers that being said if I am not taking your property we value the area that we are running the line over so let's just say breeze it's an acre and we're just running a line on your property that's an acre in length and the value of your property is a hundred dollars an acre we're going to offer you eighty dollars we're gonna probably we're going to come at 75 or 80 percent of the value because it's not taking it from you and you're still allowed to use that land to do quite a bit of what you planned on doing generally speaking you just can't build structures underneath the line when we make that offer our biggest goal my biggest goal with our right-of-way agents is to be out with handing you that offer in person because I get it like I said um I've been on the other side of this so I do understand how it feels and that when I come to you and I say hey I want to throw a line over your property and I'm going to give you eighty dollars ninety percent of you are going to be insulted and throw in the garbage because it's not what it's worth because I got to deal with this line for the rest of my life I got my kids that have to run around under it like you're worried about I've got animals that I'm grazing underneath it which I'm gonna read about but the reason that I want to present it to you in person is because what I want to get across is I am offering you this value to start you can come back to us with what value you feel it's worth the good news is on your side you don't really have to go over the top trying to justify the value you can put in you can come back with a reasonable request for more money and it's considered it was I think the east it's the one away from the center of the thank you well done thank you thank you for your comments and your questions a couple of things she might have done yeah no I just um because we're trying to Overlay our process in the regulatory requirements I just wanted to offer to you sir um so one of our requirements is a need standard so for all transmission lines have to demonstrate there's a need so there's requirements for that they'll have to meet that we also just our Council just adopted a wildfire mitigation rule so they'll have to evaluate risk in the area of the line and have a wildfire mitigation plan for our puc regulated facility it will likely be a puc reviewed and approved plan but we have requirements that you can kind of track and follow to understand how that risk will be evaluated and mitigated long term but if you have any questions because it's a good way to track and follow and press and make sure that those requirements are evaluated as best they can and so if you have any questions about those citations you can email Kate and show get you those okay so I have another commenter Les sorry I can't remember Greek okay let's create 2450 North Foothill Road um first of all thank you for being here Odie thank you for being here it's a very informative you know I'm going to start by saying I I don't think there's anybody in this room who doesn't value and appreciate the strong",

approved the minutes of the June 1st 2023 meeting and the June 23rd 2023 meeting as presented and recommended by Fair how do we have a second Mr chair um this is counselor by our second promotion thank you councilor Byer with no further questions or comments Mr secretary please call the roll Ken how and buyer Richard Devlin Jordan Truitt Cindy Condon yeah Marcy Grail motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr next we have the Council secretary report Mr Cornett thank you madam chair uh first I'll start with some staffing and Council updates uh council member truitt's term ends on September 22nd of this year um he's not he's indicated he will not be seeking a second term so we are actively looking for his replacement right now um Liz Boba who uh is our compliance officer second compliance officer is no longer with the Department of energy um so we are looking to refill her next I'm going to move on to project updates uh the first is the Muddy Creek solar project so the project is 199 megawatt solar and battery storage project proposed on 1588 Acres or 2.5 square miles in Lynn County approximately eight miles south of Brownsville and immediately east of Interstate 5. we will be holding a public information meeting on the project at the Brownsville City Hall on Tuesday July 25th so a week from today it'll start at 5 00 PM from five to six we'll hold one-on-one conversations and questions with people we'll have formal presentations by the department and the applicant at 6 pm and then at the conclusion of that we'll take questions and comments from members of the audience if any council member would like to participate either in person or virtually you're absolutely encouraged to do that please let me know so that if we have uh four or more that constitutes a quarantine is technically a council meeting so you know if up to three of you want to participate it's not a problem if Ford do that could constitute a meeting and not that it means that you shouldn't do that just means we have to provide notification in minutes and those types of things may I I listen I'm hoping to I have a 5 30 that will get over it at 6 30 and then I've got to drive there so it'd be seven I think that would be about the end of the meeting be too late yeah I think that would just probably be about the you'd Miss yeah pretty much everything I think at that point okay so I won't be there so we have two which somebody uh I don't want to have to um if if we have if it's not going to be a problem I probably can do it but I'll check in with you okay yeah I mean at this point there's three um so that's not a quorum so it'll be fine okay uh next on my list is the Sunstone um preliminary application per site um we are close to receiving that not quite yet we've received the application we're still working on getting the fee for that so we don't have formally submitted yet this was formerly known as the echo solar project uh project location is just south east of the corner of the Boardman bombing range in Morrow County and uh this would be um I don't have the megawatts in front of me but the on 10 900 Acres or 17 square miles so it's a pretty big acreage solar project next on my list is that on June 20th we received the Boardman Hemingway request for amendment number two so I know we're still in process of Boardman Hemingway amendment number one but we received their amendment number two already and we sent out notice of that on July 13th and I know that was also sent to council next on my list is the obsidian solar center amendment number one so we are close to finishing the draft proposed um we're still waiting for some information from the applicant or the certificate holder to determine that the application the request for Amendment excuse me is complete um but assuming that all goes to plan then we will issue the draft proposed um shortly and we would hold the Republican or the public hearing on the draft proposed order in Christmas Valley on August 24th so it would be the next council meeting that will be Thursday evening we would return to Lapine stay the night there and then the next day probably late morning have the regular council meeting so that's currently what we're planning but we'll certainly be in contact with council members to confirm next is the Northwest Naturals missed uh pipeline so on May 2nd 20 of this year the department received an amendment determination request from Northwest Natural they requested a determination of whether the installation of a section of the existing Flora well pipeline adjacent to the mainline Road of the within areas approved in the existing approved site certificate will require would require an amendment so the site consists of underground natural gas storage reservoirs compressor stations Gathering pipelines operations and maintenance facilities and gas transmission pipeline so we you have the jurisdiction over uh it's called above ground but a lot of it is actually below ground the difference is that the department of geology and industries have jurisdiction over the wells themselves so we have jurisdiction over parts of it dogami so um so this is the portion of the facility that that you have jurisdiction um the issue here is they found one Crossing and touching another pipeline which is not um basically it's a safety hazard so they need to change the location of of the pipeline to remove that hazard so on July 14th the department determined that an amendment was not required based upon a specific rule provision so this is OAR 345027-0353 sub 2 which states that an amendment is not required for a proposed change to the number or or location of pipelines for a surface facility related to an underground gas storage Reservoir that would not result in the facility exceeding permitted daily throughput or a change to the site boundary so the specific part about language in the rule kind of related to not necessarily this circumstances but more broadly kind of pipeline circumstances um and this does not trigger an amendment so um we did our determination uh per Oar 345-0270357 sub six that um requires that at the request of a council member um the Department's determination must be referred to council for concurrence modification or rejection so if you could be comfortable with this I know we sent the uh our determined our determination you simply have to let us know and we will put it on the agenda for the next council meeting okay a few compliance updates so next one big little canyon wind farm this is a 450 megawatt facility in Sherman County Portland General Electric is the certificate holder on July 11th PGE reported an incident at one of their turbines it's a Siemens turbine the rotor lifting hatch was found on the ground near the turbine so it had detached from the turbine and hit the ground so this is fairly new we're still looking into this and trying to determine uh the adequacy of their evaluation and response so we will be following up with you on this at a future date and done several inspections recently on July 12th during killstog conducted an operational compliance inspection at the cardi Generating Station they're doing construction related to some relatively amendments that they've done so we did that and as well as the operational on July 13th he conducted a compliance audit inspection for the coyote Springs Cogen facility and we will be issuing the reports and findings on these within the coming I talked about the next council

        "text": " and have them sign because there's a lot of opposition. I don't. We. This hasn't been discussed, but this is a pud with a large scale. So it will be presented to the board of county commissioners on December 5. But it would then it will be back, be brought back for a adoption hearing a couple months after that. So they have until at least January to gather information and support. I mean, in opposition. Okay. And since we also brought that out, we'll bring your time back to a minute. So you have an extra. You got some extra time? Well, really, everything that I wanted to say, other than what I've just said, is outlined in my letter that I provided to you guys. So if you would just read it. And again, this was all based upon previously, earlier today, the website, the county website said that you were recommending an approval. Now it's being recommended. We haven't made any recommendations up here. I'm just saying that's what was online. So that's why. That's what I am presenting to. So that's all I have. Do you want to withdraw your letter? No, absolutely not. I would like to keep my letter in. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Name and address. William McKenzie, 1790 Northeast 90th place. I don't know a lot about traffic studies, but I know when I leave 441, I go down to 326. If that red light changes at 301, I'm going to have a line car backed up all the way to old Anthony Road. And I got to sit there waiting in line till it changes again because the traffic's backed up all the way back to old Anthony Road. That's how bad the traffic is now. Thank you. Thank you. Next. Hi, my name is working Taweniki. My name is Charles White. I own a business at 6828 Northeast Jacksonville Road, Ocala. I own a business at 326 in Jacksonville Road. And right now there's a lot of planes going over my business daily with war planes and helicopters, like the guy said, which is kind of fun here and there. But I don't expect it to get any worse, really. And also, I live in Ocala, Highlands estates. I own ten properties in Ocala, Highlands estates, and my grandson. Nobody has brought this subject up tonight. Goes to school at Anthony elementary. When you put all these children in these townhomes, you're going to have a school problem. And you talk about the appraisal on houses. That's not going to happen. And overcrowding of our grocery stores, our drug stores that are in our neighborhood, our gas stations. And you got the airplane noise and what will it do for my family? And the also, the Audena housing has been approved, and that's already makes it worse. So that's all I got to say. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you coming. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Sorry. Go ahead. We won't start your time until you give me your name and address. I apologize. Thank you. Already. I've already called the county. The county has come out to check the traffic on West Anthony Road. We have semis, we have large trucks with trailers. We have small children walking to school to and from school that live on west Anthony and northeast 95th street. This is a very dangerous area. It's already compact with all this traffic. I've been here, I've been living there for 52 years, and I've watched it. And in the past year and a half that traffic has quadrupled. Now on the aircraft, I have taken pictures of the aircraft, the corkscrewing with the airplanes going up the corkscrew, screwing coming. You have to talk in airplane over our homes now. I have grandchildren. We have many children in the area. They scream and holler of the danger. I have pictures of the airplanes flying below treelines. I have numbers on the tailwind of the airplanes. So it's not just the noise, it's the safety too, for our homes and our community. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Hi, my name, can you hear me? Hi, my name is Christina Larson. I live at 9349 West Anthony Road, Ocala, Florida. May have to write this down. We are. We will not start the timer until you give me your name and address. And I have to be able to understand you. I'm speaking as fast as other people. 93 49 West Anthony Road, Ocala, Florida. I'm in the foreign protection area. I am three doors, three ranches from 95th street. I'm next to Jonathan, who is immediately next to John Belair. I have a horse ranch and my horses are scared shitless of those black Hawk helicopters flying super low over my property. I have ten acres. I am stuck with ten acres. I can't subdivide and build condos because I'm a little person, you know, so it's total discrimination. I am very concerned about wildlife. All the little red cardinals shut up. They fly away and they're gone for half a day after. I wake up at 07:00 a.m. on a Sunday hearing choppers or the warplanes, and they circle and I'm like, is this personal or why is it so close to me all the time? Because we are so close, you know, I'm going to research, how high air rights do I really have? You know, because this is getting very old. I can't even hear people on the telephone if I'm working. I can't hear myself. Excuse me. Oh, are you at the airport? Are you in Orlando? No, I'm actually in the farmland preservation area in Ocala, Florida. You know, this is very, very bad. And talk about increasing real estate value. Sure, maybe. Yeah, if you sell about 1 million, 2 million next to me, that's good. Unless for the airplanes and the choppers. Okay. I already know people that have shown properties and people have said, what is that? There's a chopper there. I don't like this area. So that is bullshit, you know, I'm sorry, that is counterproductive. Ma'am, please. Okay. I think my time is up. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Did I squeeze in enough? Go ahead, sir. We have a microphone area. No, he right next to him going away from. I have no problem with Mister Boole flying his personal airplanes. They belong to him. He bought that airplane to do that. We're not here to talk about Mister Bull's airplane. We're here to talk about the development. I'm very concerned about one area. Next, you can speak in a microphone and you can tell. I'm concerned about these properties here, which are developed. And the property here, this one right here, was considered to be commercial. I have a horse rescue. Sir, this way. You have to tell. You have to walk this way. Watch this way. I have to look at you. Okay, okay. I have a horse rescue here. I have 17 head of different horses. And we've done this for over 20 years. We do it on our own money. We are 501 c or whatever it is. We're all that stuff are certified, you know, the airplanes don't bother our horses. They don't really give a shit about them, but I do. I'm concerned about that commercial property beside us because that will bother the horses. That's high commercial density next to the residential properties on each side there. Residential, multifamily. This. Well, it's already. That's. That pre exists. Yeah, well, I know that that's supposed to be townhome truckers. I'm sorry, then I don't have a concern about that. If it's going to be a multifamily tendency. Welcome. We're glad that we satisfied you. Appreciate it. Next member. Next, please. Hi, I'm Kelly Taub. I live at 640 Northeast 77th street. I'm on the backside of jumbo lair. That street is 1 mile long. It's a very country road. We were paved about a year and a half ago. Surprisingly, I'll say something different. We're the fifth generation on our property. Started with great granddad. Now it's down to my grandchildren. I'm on five acres, daughter's next door with my two grandchildren. We have improved the property over the years. We just built three years ago. My daughter built next door five years ago. It's not even safe now for us to take our evening walks, ride the horse, ride our bicycles. Because we have become the shortcut between Anthony Road, West Anthony Road and Jacksonville Road. It's supposed to be 30 miles an hour. They race through there. They don't live there. You shouldn't even be on that road if you don't belong there, if you don't live there. They keep talking about subdivisions. There's no subdivision on Northeast 77th street. We all own small farms, anywhere from five to maybe 20 acres. I don't know all my neighbors, I'm sure they're here, but they're small farms and we have horses and we have chickens and we have a cow or two. This affects us trying to get out at the end of West Anthony Road right now. It's crazy. I mean, you try to get out even. I mean, on Jacksonville Road, you'll pull to the end of our street and they come flying over the hill from Anthony towards town and you can hardly get out there. I'm surprised there hasn't been an accident there at night. You can't even see to pull back into our road on Northeast ",

        "text": " that and then the enforcement part will be I will have to you know do the best we can so the three E's that I always remember I think there's a fourth one now too isn't there I believe there is a lot of these talked about it I don't I don't remember yeah yeah what is it I don't know it's probably environmental okay yeah no it's fine I think you're right I just think that there's I also uh gonna be obvious there's private landowners in recovery up there and there's a lot of property that was tree lines that were burned that prevent people from knowing the private versus Public Access and if I was a private landowner up there I would I would go above and beyond to try to protect my property also myself from people who are on my property and potentially could be um but I think that this plan the the goal is is to try to guide people to um environments that they can park in that are that are less harmful and uh you know to try to to gather I guess the traffic in a way that's safe and I mean it's really expensive to recover up there and it's going to be really difficult for people to stake off their lands and I just hope that people are respectful when the road does open and they don't just go tranching through people's damaged burned property because it's very emotional for them and their reactions when people encroach on their land right now is not always um what you would expect because they're so traumatized so I'm glad that we're here today and this is moving ahead it's just one step closer to that future September date of opening the road I appreciate that and I will uh pass along the the thoughts about Carl and Lonnie and their entire team because I know our whole traffic team put a lot of time into this yeah and they they spent a lot of time developing this plan and put a lot of thought into it so really appreciate it all right I moved to approve amendment number one to the public Improvement agreement with Mid Valley excavation to add 53 962 dollars for a new contract total of 146 562 dollars for the North Fork fire recovery traffic information signage and installation project through August 31st 2024. I'll second the motion any further discussion hearing none all is in favor signify by saying aye aye all right great thanks Ryan thank you all right I'm gonna recess the Board of Commissioners and convene a contract review board uh under Public Works consider approval of an order to set a public hearing date for August 2nd 2023 to allow for the use of alternate alternative Contracting method to solicit construction manager and general contractor proposals for the construction of the Brooks hot mirror Wastewater and drinking water project so I have a couple of us here today camber Chris welcome thank you good morning my name is camber schlegg I'm the contracts and procurement manager within the finance department with Marion County Public Works so we're here to uh request a public hearing on August 9th for um proposed alternative procurement process for the Brooks hot mirror Wastewater and drinking water projects um I'll just mention that a previous version said August 2nd on the documents but we adjusted that so your board packet now should say August 9th so for some background on this project as part of the county 67 million dollar arpa award the board has allocated a total of about 15 million dollars for improvements to the water and wastewater systems on behalf of the Brooks Community Service District the overall project includes improvements to the wastewater treatment system the sanitary sewer collection system the water supply storage pumping treatment and a improvements to the water distribution system that's the overall concept that was presented in the Brooks hot mirror future reports and we have awarded a contract to Keller and Associates to take the next step in performing engineering studies and master planning part that effort will be a recommendation because we have 15 million dollars approximately and that's not enough to construct all of those improvements we will be recommending those that we can construct with the available budget to get the best possible benefit and that will be recommended to the district so the the concept of bringing in a cmgc into that wood also include continuous feedback and iterative estimating in order to make those decisions on a cost basis so that the end result will be a recommendation to the district along with a uh summary of what those improvements would cost using real-time data there are two main challenges with this um the first is of course the arpa deadlines so those arpa funds have to be obligated by December 31st of 2024. that means that all design permitting must be complete to a state that is that is ready for either bids or in the case of a cmgc contract the guaranteed maximum price and then all of those funds must be fully expended that includes construction and commissioning of any improvements by December 2026 that's a very aggressive deadline and these type of fast deliveries is What alternative procurements excel at and then also with that there's going to be just we anticipate a surge in construction work due to the Wildfire recovery arpa grants and other large programs so another point of consideration for a centralized cmgc is one party that can kind of wrangle all those different contractors and bring it all together to help with the project um to talk about the findings this is camber I'll turn over to you all right thank you so Public Works has identified the cmgc solicitation method as the preferred Contracting method because of the complex nature of the project um this requires greater emphasis on the general contractor's experience and Technical ability as well as the very strict expenditure and deadlines associated with the Project funding that Chris just talked about so in order to use this process or organ revised Statute tour 279c 0.335 requires the local contract review board to make certain findings as part of an authorizing the use of this method those findings are attached to the packets that you do have but the main high levels of the factors in considering this process is the fact that it's not going to encourage favoritism so similar to an RFP process the cmgc process allows for us to issue similar to like an RFP where the evaluation process is about experience it's about the ability to respond to the technical complexity of the project to meet the timelines the past performance and the value of the contract so this selection process is done through evaluation it's done by a team and then the awarded contract is then negotiated with the contractor so this contract process will also result in a cost savings and that's due to that negotiation of the cost process so if you have any questions regarding the cmgc process I do um just really quick and it's probably for Brenda the documents that we're going to sign due say August 9th okay because everything in here still says August 2nd okay okay all right I'm looking at Council as long as we make the motion for August SEC or August 9th yeah okay good other than I got a call on Monday I was just telling Dennis about this yesterday from a commercial owner in Brooks he's really struggling with their water I think it's significant there's major issues out in that Community it's old um you know this I think she had no idea this was coming it was a great conversation because of course she was pretty frustrated on the phone and was like hey you're the service District board blah blah blah and I was like yeah and by the way we just gave you like 15 million dollars to try to fix it and she was like oh so this is the first step right to get to where we need to be so Chris and whoever can be out in the community knocking doors and talking about what's to come and it is limited but it's I think going to provide a significant improvement over what currently exists out in that community and then will allow for future expansion um as a community sees fit so I'm glad we're here and you know like good old Marion County fashion we're up against a yeah the the other question I may have and this goes back to probably Council going to Naco this week for this extension of arpa the December 31st 2026 timeline that Congress put on those monies if we can get something done it it I'm not trying to slow this thing down but if we can get something down we can come back and modify this contract if we had to that if say they extended another year or two uh to expand those I haven't seen the actual contract contract done yet but yeah but okay yeah if that happens we want to make sure we can it any of these contracts Brian that we're doing yeah okay all right so anything else no all right do you want me to move to close the contract review board and approve the order or just close yeah okay then I moved I moved to close the contract for you board and approve an order to set a public hearing date for August 9th 2023 to allow for the use of an alternative Contracting method to solicit construction manager and general contractor proposals for the construction of the Berks hot mere Wastewater and drinking water project oh second the motion any further no go ahead all right all is in favor signify by saying aye aye aye okay contract review board is adjourned and we will reconvene the Board of Commissioners meeting okay almost screwed up the contract for you board um yes she she's going somewhere more grandiose I'm sure super disappointed congratulations thank you I don't know someone told me in the elevator last week and last night on my way home I almost stopped on your floor and knocked on your door and said oh really so yes I did not know that I will miss you guys too it's been a great almost 11 years it's been exciting never a dull moment yeah when I first when I first got here you you were like sliding in I think took over the position because yeah I took it over in 2014. was it 2014. yeah that's right and you've done a great job thank you yeah thank you thank you for your service yes thank you guys and I I live in the county so I'll be around all right good thank you Chris thank you camber anything you want to uh discuss I just want to say that we are not here next week so forth so we'll see everybody in August if I didn't if I don't melt in Texas and know thank you",

        "text": " sighting division the applicants the reviewing agencies the public you know one of the things that we want to make sure is that when we're um when we're proposing the projects that are going to be worked on that there is a good um broad you know value across all of those stakeholders you know and which which truly is not defined um but and the reason why we wanted to bring up this slide is to say this interim plan really is just focused on those subset but it was we wanted to also clarify we recognize that and we don't want to do any disservice to everybody who participates in our process but given the fact that she's still new still learning this the this interim plan to work on a subset of projects is kind of by Nature she's going to be limited you know in sort of timeing capacity and what she can do until she comes pully up to speed and so those projects really are just sort of related to citing division certificate holders you know on operational sites but when she comes back in June or July to say okay this is what I'm going to be working on for the next year um what do you think do you have any thoughts or ideas do you agree do you disagree we wanted to convey with that sort of second um column that we're going to make sure that it has value and applicability across everybody who participates and you know it's a good comment it you know it unfortunately omitted you know council members because you are absolutely you know a stakeholder in our process we consider ourselves stakeholders in our own process yeah and just I I read that as the council is the umbrella and this is these are the people that are doing the work and so understood it that way but I yeah I and I I think it's a good question because I want you to understand it slightly different than that is you know I you're not just the umbrella you have you know the way information gets provided to you the way you review information the way the whole process works around you you're a stakeholder of the process just how staff is because you know we spend a lot of time and if we can do things better for ourselves we need to do that if we can do things better for the council we need to do that so I'm glad you brought up the question because yes you should be on that list as well thank you and I I didn't mean to suggest that I wasn't a we weren't a stakeholder that the umbrella was was absolutely a stakeholder yes no but I do appreciate it again it's these kinds of conversations make sure that we're thinking about it and you know and I think the right way and and now that you brought even though that wasn't necessarily your intent I think that allows me to think about it a little bit differently and then hopefully armor it as well thank you council member Byer thank you um just a quick question looking at this list and um thinking about the future of process Improvement we rely we the council and the department I think rely heavily on reviewing agencies and wondering if are things we should work on in terms of timeliness of reviewing agency comments um that might help staff it it just seems like we're we are always waiting for additional information not always but sometimes and um we we need the input from those agencies and if there are things we can do to streamline that process so it's just something to put out there for the future and yet again they should be included on the list so you know our our our mistake for not including and I agree with you you know we just like we support council members you know we feel it's our job well to support everybody frankly to make sure that they understand how to participate in our process what their role is and what are the things that we can do to make that as easy as possible the difficulty with you know review agencies is you know everybody's at capacity and just because we can even provide them resources funding doesn't mean they have the Staffing to be able to do that so we spend a lot of time trying to work with reviewing agencies trying to educate them trying to help them to give us the information that we need when we need it it's an ongoing process um and you know an ODFW who actually has a body who's assigned to be our liaison at least that's part of his role no other agencies really have I mean they may have somebody who gets sort of uh sort of maybe assigned but you know in my time here I've seen that happen and that person moves or they reassign it to somebody else there's a constant education component that we have to do for reviewing agencies because there could be staff turnover there could be you know a long time frame between when we actually worked with that agency it may be that you know we've had a couple of years where the projects don't really trigger that Agency for review I mean they're all noticed but not maybe substantively so they may not have participated couple years later on you know we got to educate them again so there there absolutely is a lot you know that we need to be thinking about to try to make that process as as as easy as we can for them and for sta yes thank you all right thank you that's it that's it that's okay well welcome to the team and we look forward to meeting you in person and collaborating with you as you uh get through the initial time and if we can be of any assistance as council members I think we'd all be more than willing to offer whatever perspective we have wonderful thank you so much thank you all right next on our handy list is a request to amend mitigation plans this is an action item we have Sarah esterson senior policy advisor here to present good afternoon good afternoon chair Grail and members of the council for the record my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy adviser with the Oregon Department of energy sighting Division and our agenda item today is to present you with changes that are proposed by the certificate holder for the noxious weed control plan and the fire safety plan for patch wewi Fields formerly known as the Montag solar project uh patch wewi Fields is a 162 megawatt solar facility it occupies um 1,189 acres in Gillum County and it has um only been an operation for less than a year they started commercial operation in April of 2023 so less than 10 months um the intent of the presentation today is to achieve several goals the first is to remind and inform Council and the public that mitigation plans change outside of the formal permitting process outside of the site certificate amendment process um another goal is to pull the department and Council into the details of mitigation plans which can be challenging when you're reviewing a draft proposed order or even a final order um just due to the volume of documentation you have in front of you at the that time and then lastly to seek substantive input on the changes that are actually proposed um and any questions uh and comments that you might have and I do apologize for my voice um at the January meeting we had a similar presentation Council reviewed changes to propose mitigation plans for four facilities and so as we as as omet just mentioned continue to grow our compliance program I believe this will be more common as we're able to focus on uh limitations and even failures of mitigation plans to achieve what they're trying to achieve or or they might need to change based on improved understanding of site conditions um better approaches that we want documented in those medication plans okay so as discussed at the January presentation um I want we want to point out that the statute under ORS 46944 2 is the authority that Council exercises to delegate future review and approval of mitigation plans to the um this delegation applies often times in preconstruction conditions where a condition would defer finalization and approval of a mitigation plan to the department and then mitigation plans often have uh Provisions that allow future Amendment or modification of that subject to Department approval um so again these are delegations of authority that council is granting when you review plans during the permitting process so be aware of this look at the condition language when you see this when it says a plan is to be finalized and approved by the department this is the delegation of authority so make sure you agree that you're doing that um but we do aim to bridge gaps uh in transparency and discretion by bringing plan amendments uh in front of council which is typically also required in the plans themselves um so the certificate holder for patchway wh Fields is Montag solar LLC which is owned by Aven grid Renewables LLC and the change they're seeking approval for is to incorporate a sheep management plan into their noxious weed control and fire safety plants so that's pretty like sheep management this is a new thing that's actually coming forward um thank you Nancy um so for context of these plans where did they come from why are we doing this uh implementation and adherence to a noxious weed plan is was imposed in this site certificate for this facility under the council's land use standard note that it's generally required for all fsec facilities either under the land use standard or fish and wildlife or both um for this facility the noxious weed plan condition was imposed to comply with a land conservation and development commission rule it's a rule that applies to solar facilities and specifically in efu zone land and specifically requires control um and abatement of noxious weeds uh it was also referenced under the fish and wildlife habitat standard for this facility as it's um it's unne necessity to achieve habitat restoration of temporary impacts next slide please and then the fire safety plan that we mentioned also needs to be adjusted to incorporate sheet management the fire safety plan for this facility was imposed as a condition under the council's Public Services standard it was intended to minimize impacts to fire service providers by ensuring that there was adequate risk protection at the site so this is the existing condition existing plan risk protection is covered by worker training requirements annual coordination with local fire service providers vegetation management and then adequate evaluation of controls at the site so sheet management comes into the veg management component thank you um so again for both of these plans that apply during operations the certificate holders requesting that they be amended to incorporate a sheep management strategy their sheep are being proposed primarily to control vegetation in lie of mowing to reduce on-site fire risk uh and fuel sources mowing is described by the certificate holder as difficult and impossible",

        "text": " option C is knowing how much estimated can this generate and then sustainability talks specifically about whether it would be a onetime Thing versus an ongoing um Revenue generating yeah Becky ban I think maybe if you did the scorekeeping without those two factors and then laid them out into a plan and said well these would these would give you uh income quickly these not this one is a small thing that's at the same time as some big things so let's toss it because it's more trouble than it's worth that might be the time to do it not in the scoring part but in the putting together of a whole picture yeah exactly so what of what are those pieces um that you want to make sure are under consideration when you're putting together your menu yeah yes um I saw uh yeah Beth first and Keith Beth Vargus Duncan I agree thank you this is Keith Norris I was going to um actually disagree a little bit and the thought that uh you could have in terms of the rubric situation right have one of those scores be does it raise less than a million then it scores zero if it raises 45 50 million and it scores five right and and have those various ranks there um because I think that to to one of the earlier points right if if we can get money in quick the fact that it's sustainable or not doesn't necessarily matter as much right if it can get quick in the door we can have that $50 million input uh over the next two years as a one-time deal that might uh sustain us into the future so I I think it could fit into the rubric and I'm not sure there's necessarily a threshold that's needed if you have a way of assigning the score value in the rubric to those various funding uh buckets or various funding levels and then the question is is it over complicating things to assign a score to different Revenue if we're not excluding got it right this time if we're not excluding any option just based on it Revenue generating potential part of the analysis will automatically be what does this generate over time and so if it's not going to be something that's used to evaluate or eliminate different options that don't meet a certain threshold then it might not be useful to have as part of the Criterion I'm not sure I agree it wouldn't necessarily be useful for eliminating but I think in terms of ranking the various criteria that could be useful um as or at least as useful as as some of these other metrics on there yeah um I saw Jean I saw your hand go up and down really quick and then yeah and then Bill go ahead je Jean Peter um uh items three four and five are somewhat subjective and would our analysis have enough information to actually provide sufficient information to score them at all so Equitable I can see looking at things like um people's income and house value and all that but local economy I'm I'm not sure how that would work and impact on environment equally so so they're very important but I'm not sure how we would measure them in a meaningful way that's my comment yeah and when you say three four and five you're looking at the ones under the task force criteria task force yes okay great Bill thanks uh bill smone I think it's really important to have the estimated uh Revenue potential uh in whatever way was described um it's I think just we need to know that but the the thing I'm interested in knowing about is the difference between the impact timeline and the level of administrative effort so is the impact timeline simply how fast it will take to deliver cash right exactly but that does not include the impact on the administrative staff Staffing that's exactly yeah correct okay thank you so the administrative time is the um simply the administrative burden of administering whatever option that is a tax or a levy or any of the above yes I see Matt and then um Russ I see you next Matt hail um I I agree sustainability probably would be my number one but I would broaden the definition I would argue that the definition is not just recurring or one time it's also how the community sees those funds spent and what's that impact in our community and to me that would mean not putting those funds into the general fund but having some type of controls where they can be audited have a specific fiscal code attached to them so the community could see that they're being spent for police and fire and ambulance or they're being spent for the library or they're being spent for parks those kinds of any things so I think that you Jesse talked about that that the the 101 participants you know stress transparency and they stress being able to see where those funds that they're going to reach into their pocket to give to the city where are they going and what are they used for so they can see what they're being used for yeah Tommy hello again everybody Tom Tommy coning Moss atams um one point of just clarification the um sort of the exercise why we're all here like is necessarily about the general fund so just a just a point of clarification in that you could conceivably have things with Revenue options saying like the this revenue is going to go to fire this revenue is going to go to police and you could have some of that control but it will it wouldn't be it's unlike to be outside of the general fund itself so you could still have it in function but um just wanted to make sure that was clear forgive me that's not clear to me okay my understanding of general fund money is that that can be moved by the council uh from one pot to the other within the general fund from from police and fire to Parks or to whatever depending on the will of the council now if you were to have some kind of um say a local option right to fund one or the other aspect of general of the general fund so say the library gets a certain amount of general fund money now and then we attached a local option to that that that is we raised the local option tax to supplement the library that money that is the supplemental money cannot be used for any other purpose going to defer to Josh here but I believe you're correct uh in the case of a local option Levy you're right to be dedicated however the ballot language uh was written doesn't mean it can't go in the general fund we have restricted funds that go into the general fund uh they get used for their restricted purpose um it's kind of a gimme we have to audit in it anyways uh what we do what we would do in this case if there was that additional requirement uh you could say hey we want the Auditors to specifically look at this uh use of the funding to validate that it's been used for its uh proposed purpose uh it is problematic to move things out of the general fund uh unless it's a whole service so if you were to say okay this is to fund the library and you're pulling the whole Library out that works if you're saying hey we're going to fund a portion of the police uh police department it doesn't really work cuz then part of them are in the general fund part of them are out and you're still moving money back and forth right may I may I follow yes and then I'm going to redirect the conversation kind of back towards the criteria that can be used but yes I don't want to complicate anything I can stop so I think this is good this is good conversation but I think Falls a little bit outside of that decision-making criteria so when you're looking at these pieces right ultimately um at the end of this we're going to come up with if you want to hit this target here's kind of the menu options of Revenue generating the revenue generating options that we propose and so at the end of it you'll be able to to say we Pro propose X Y and Z because we ranked them based on their sustainability legal viability um how Equitable they are in the community we did a little bit of analysis here's what we understand about their impact on the local economy impact on the environment the level of administrative effort required and then whether or not they're used in pure cities and so when you're thinking of going through all these 41 options and taking 41 and going down to kind of the menu of what will help folks achieve this target these are kind of the different evaluative criteria that you want to be able to say we recommended this because we evaluated it because we looked at it because and so when you're talking about that communication piece and that need for people to understand kind of where that where dollars are going based on the different options that is one where you could look at um it's just a layer of variability that you could apply to any option moving forward and so rather than using that potentially as an eval Val ative criteria it could be a signal for communication to the community um and those kinds of pieces Keith I see you jumping out of your seat yes static uh totally agree on the communication side one of my questions on the criteria um is on the sustainability term and and I'm trying to recall the survey we were given in terms of how that was defined but I think um one the ability to generate Revenue over time but I also think a piece that that if it's not captured in that uh C category that that we should consider adding is the ability of that Revenue stream to grow over time with uh Salem's population right so how can uh the for instance you know if we put $10 as an operations fee that's sustainable uh but it's not necessarily growing uh over time yep depending on on on which Revenue Source we're talking about yeah and that time Horizon would be part of that Revenue potential analysis yeah great question um I saw Sean and then I saw Nate well I mean I realize that one through four probably speak to this in some ways but should political viability be a criteria that we would consider would you ever eliminate something in your in the process based on that I mean I would yes if that's what you're asking yeah I mean that's an open question so I heard a yes I also heard another yes yeah what do folks think um I did see I want to make sure that but Nate has a chance and then yeah and then I saw also Kathy and then Bill Nate raffen um so uh a few committee members have discussed uh that we have some Revenue options that are you know more sustainable longterm and then we've got others that uh maybe are less sustainable but can bring in cash quickly and I I just wanted to make the",

        "text": " and the lighting under the cumo of effect standard which we just reviewed um and if I could get the next um we will say we we don't have a recommendation on how that should be done we don't think there were practical measures raised in the comments that can be easily implemented without um adversely affecting the operations of the facility so but I we did want to scope out the issue more for you and and see if you had additional ideas wanted us to go further um this slide shows the current state of energy development in the vicinity um you can see that this uh facility is proposed to be cited uh obviously adjacent to the other Wheat Ridge facilities towards the the left in the yellow um you can see the striped uh components of the proposed Sunstone solar project and the proposed Wagon Trail solar project um also close to the bombing range um there's an existing or multiple existing local jurisdictional wind farms to the north of the project and then the proposed no one Hills uh facility would be going into the East um if I can get the next slide um we don't really have the capability of doing the visual impacts analysis in house but I did want to show that we we can see where turban locations are uh in the vicinity so you can see the green and um uh locations different color uh it kind of throughout the site boundary here and then you can see where the existing um other turbine locations are to the west and north of the facility um so it does add a significant number of turbines to an area that's already uh experiencing sub substantial energy development um people have uh arguments on either side that that's a good thing that's not a good thing um so this is just what it is uh I guess going back to the comments about public utilities I do also want to point out that the b2h line is proposed to intersect with this site boundary um and would cross the uh transmission line Corridor and the alternate route to the left of the main Green Line there I think is what's being considered under Amendment three two two not not there yet um okay if I could get to the next slide um this is the certificate holders uh zone of visual influence um modeling for the proposed facility and just the proposed facilities turbines um and I just want to show that that the turbines would be visible from most of the northern part of the county um as well as much of uh the northern part of umill County the the vicinity um what's indicated by the coloring here is how many turbine locations are visible um I do want to point out that distance attenuation and topography May screen well may make some of these turbines less visible this is really a bare Earth analysis um I think you're familiar with these kind of analyses now um the uh uh yeah I I go into more specifics about um the Le and but turbines but we do believe that them being prominent in their geographic location they would be be visible for much of the green areas um at least closer to them so uh if I could get the next slide please uh so this is the certificate holders visual simulation um of what the turbines or what the facility would look like from just north of the Confluence of little Butter Creek and butter Creek um it's hard to see with the lighting in the room uh but there are multiple turbines visible on the um north side of Le and view uh and then on the top of the The View as well um this is from a distance I think of two miles um have to check exactly uh so you can see there will be turbines visible um there will be a number of turbines visible not just the ones on the top of the but um uh I guess that is for one reason I I guess I I wanted to bring this up in part just to show that eliminating the turbines on the top of the view wouldn't necessarily eliminate all of the visual impacts from the facility the horizontal line represents the height the horizontal line represents um where the components are in the viewshed so it's really hard to see now but on the very Left End it there is a turbine visible on the top of the but and then on the very right end of it you can see portions of turbines or turbines blades that are cited uh moving down that Ridge Wine okay um if you oh that's not the height that they're going to the height they would go the distance yeah that's just where they are in the viewshed um great so next slide um and again this is just another depiction of the map of the turbines on gleum but itself you can see um uh towards the lower right hand side of the slide is more of the peak of the but and then there's these turbine strings going down the fingers of the be um Topography is not great and then of course there would be this access road going to the um uh proposed lay down yard in the middle um uh so yeah this is all really just for your reference and kind of to give you some scoping we did want to hear if you have any additional input or or would like us to dig into this further um because of this particular layout uh it does it's it's not clear how many turbines would need to be eliminated to to Really mitigate the visual impacts um and so I think the council's decision on what's practicable really becomes comes into play with if we're looking at any kind of mitigation for elimination of turbine locations and if there's no Council sort of two comments one big umbrella we did hear comments on cumulative effects of energy development in this part of the state and we heard that from a couple of commenters um during our meeting in Heron and that's a separate bit that we probably need to have a discussion about without decisions at this point but to to be thoughtful about it because that landscape has changed fairly dramatically in the past 20 some years on the recent you issues um our standards are pretty clear on what's protected and what we have to respond to the cumulative effect standard probably allows us some discretion but as you pointed out what that looks like is is pretty pretty hard to determine and thinking about that um I I don't have a an easy solution I certainly sympathize with the property owners whose whose world is changing but I'm not sure that we have the tools um in our standards to address that and correct me if I'm wrong but as I read through things that's kind of where I'm landing I was this is kanton I was thinking this we don't really have cor correct me if I'm wrong design review standards for something like the number of towers on a landscape uh at what point do you reach a saturation or you know something that visually becomes um something we'd want to regulate I guess I'll to secretary as but uh chair how that's that's a question I I oh believe I agree CH okay uh uh councelor CH to I see you there thank you chair how for the record this Perry choc I want to make the aware that uh in the last 10 years we've lost 37 species of birds across the planet and these wind energy projects are a big contributor to their death so any type of studies or analysis that can take place to curb that death of what the tribes consider a sacred animal Birds they're they're incapable of sin they carry our prayers to heaven we we need to look and make sure that we're not putting pure poison out there on the landscape I have I heard that uh down in California one of the wind energy facilities uh made a false statement when they talked about the fatality of birds of raptor and it was it was Eagles and it was a massive amount that was killed in the facility so I just wanted to make everybody aware of that that um these these projects have the capability of doing Mass damage and being on the Flyway doesn't help them very much so so anything we can do to protect these animals that that don't have a voice we have to have a voice for them so thank you for your time today thank you counselor chak toot um any other comments from Council I'll just respond um to your question and I think at least from my perspective that visual impacts cumulative or not is one of the hardest environmental impacts to evaluate because they're we don't have as the department of energy specific criteria at which point I mean what we do have is the definition of significant and we have seen some developers break that down to evaluate this in combination with one or more factors is it significant to that that's being impacted whether it's a person or a resource um but yeah I mean we don't have a metric that says at certain height with certain infrastructure now it's significant or ACC cumulative impact so it's a difficult question and standard the cumulative standard doesn't have division 21 information requirements which further limits our ability to go well what was it that they were supposed to do in the first place to evaluate the standard um but thank you Tom for looking into that any other comments chair how yes um I I don't have a comment specific speically for this project that we're looking at right now but more of a broad comment about cumulative effects and um you brought up that word significant seems to be the the real matter it's hard to really um understand for me it's hard to understand how do I how do I look at this as a significant issue enough um when I don't have anything to go off of um but yet at the same time the landscape is dramatically transforming in front of my eyes so something is happening but there is no I'm not in a place to where I can actually give input to what's happening I don't know if that makes sense or not but I I'm um I'm hoping that this cumulative effect is um more thoroughly looked at during our role making um because that's probably the most appropriate time for that to happen so um but I do also sympathize with um the comments that were brought up um during public comic period and just um how dramatic it really is um and want to make sure that that's that's known by this Council thank you okay right uh thank you council members thank you for the discussion um I won't revisit it I did want to respond to council member chak T's comment that there there are uh and I think uh council member devilin is raising his hand maybe more physical councelor Devin we see your wanting to say something oh councelor delin can you hear me is he muted can you hear me now yes we gotta I must have been muted there",

        "text": " osseo will continue to participate if the formal rulemaking does move forward we believe the rules can be more streamlined for solar facilities and to bring us back to some context we know we're in a climate crisis and oregon feels the impacts of that crisis acutely with increased wildfires droughts heat waves ocean acidification changing in habitat and all the other impacts we know about decarbonizing oregon's energy system will require a significant build out of renewable energy facilities with models suggesting that the most cost effective time frame is before 2030. the already lengthy timeline for renewable energy facility approval and permitting makes 2030 a possible date but somewhat ambitious given all the uncertainties in the existing process those uncertainties are unfortunately potentially exacerbated with some of the proposed solutions in the draft again we agree we need to keep regulations up to date and rules but we are concerned that the changes inject more uncertainty into the citing process applications rely on evidence-based process creating uncertainty or open-ended requirements through changes places a greater burden on the applicant to prove the negative in its submissions in some case the additional burden not only adds costs and time but again is in contradiction to the objectives set out by governor brown's climate executive a particular importance to asea and its members is the staff recommendation to eliminate the analysis area when applying these standards deleting the analysis area would leave the application of the standards very open-ended and would be inconsistent with how the council applies other standards like land use would lead to insignificant uncertainty about what data intense and and create technologies a very data intensive burden for applicants the draft rules also make rules harder to understand for applicants and the general public for example some of the draft rules will make the new aresa mapping tool that oda is working on harder to use for instance how would a mapping tool deal with a potential addition to a national wild and scenic river system it would be frustrating to have a new tool that we know odor has worked hard on and then have it immediately undermined with the ambiguity ambiguity created in these rules uh with respect to the discussion of the last s-sec meeting regarding the consideration of historic properties of religious and cultural significance to tribes ocea recommends that the council adopt staff's recommendation for future rulemaking on that topic and have the options discussed in the staff report explored during that rulemaking and not decided today lucia believes that rulemaking on that topic in particular would lead to a more robust discussion of stakeholders and allow us to have greater time to analyze the potential avenues for addressing impacts to these areas osceola wants to support the tribe's desire to protect these cultured areas and we believe that a separate rule making would be the best avenue to ensure that all concerns are heard and considered and we look forward to participating in that separate bowl making project thank you very much thank you very much for your comments all right madam chair we have a gentleman in the audience here gene cotton there you go he's going to step up there by wally and has a statement thank you welcome mr cotton good morning um my name is gene cotton and i'm the president of next and i want to thank the council uh for accepting the the next renewable fuels project that we're putting in westward or plan to put in for westward we feel it it brings a significant benefit to oregon and also reducing co2 emissions you know we do plan to bring over 200 new jobs full-time jobs to oregon we feel like they're going to be very valuable to the to especially to the classic and i in addition you know we will by making renewable diesel and market in that product we will substantially have a impact on the co2 emissions over 7 tons a year of reduction including total total life cycle emissions so that includes our process and everything so it's it's a significant benefit to the to the the other things we'd like to kind of uh i think talk a little bit about is there was a discussion about use of natural gas for production of hydrogen one of the things we are doing to kind of minimize that impact is we are going to recycle biogenic material both the nafta and the lpg and the gases that are produced from the uh the process will be recycled back to the hydrogen producing facility uh and produce a co2 uh excuse me produce hydrogen but that that's all being produced from a biogenic material that's been you know from vegetable oils or from animal fats so that you know in in general that reduces our co2 production from up uh from just a natural gas source by almost two-thirds to three-quarter of that volume so we wanted to kind of say i think the question came up about is there ways to produce hydrogen that are that are more efficient and this is definitely one of the ways we we see that we can do that and again i just want to thank everybody for their participation i think it's uh this is a great project i've been working on it for a long time and i'd like to see it go through so thank you thank you for your comments auntie is there anyone else wanting to speak um i do have daniel sarins on the line but i did want to make sure that everybody knows how to raise their hand in case there were people that didn't know that so if your webinar participant at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons click on the participant and in the bottom right hand of the participant window is a hand icon if you click on that it will raise your hand and when you're done you can click on it again to lower your hand if you are on the phone press star 3 on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and press star 3 again on your keypad to lower your hand now i think all right well it looks like mr sirens has lowered his hands so at this point i do not see any further comments oh wait he put his hand back up hey dan all right mr sarah's i've got you thank you i lowered my hand when you mentioned my name so thank you so much chair grill members of the council thank you for the opportunity to speak today my name is dan sears i'm the conservation director for columbia riverkeeper i just have a short process comment on the next issue fsx approval of next application would come into question if the land use board of appeals or any other court were to invalidate columbia county's landing's approval for next proposed rail yard the order correctly states that local land use approval for next refinery and rail yard were granted by columbia county however columbia river keeper one thousand friends of oregon and others are currently appealing the landis approval of the rail yard before luba if that appeal is successful next will no longer have the local landis approval that efsec acknowledges is required for the exemption i just add that we have reason to believe that luba has the potential to overturn columbia county's landy's approval for next railyard luba has repeatedly found as staff alluded that the county's attempts to allow industrial uses in this general area at port westward violate oregon's land use planning laws and the oregon department of land use i'm sorry the oregon department of land conservation and development specifically warned columbia county that next proposed justification for land use approval for the rail yard might conflict with oregon land use law accordingly we urge efsec to revisit this hap this exemption if luba does rule against the railyard uh with respect to the protected areas scenic resources and recreation standards rulemaking if you were to proceed we we would support option one because option one seems to be more protective of historic properties of religious and cultural significance to indian tribes that are listed on the national register of historic places fsa can protect resources now by expanding the standard is suggested in option one staff suggests that further rulemaking could occur to issues that arise and to deepen the consultation staff find that the expanded protected areas would quote likely result in identification of more potentially affected properties end quote to us this seems like a good thing potentially averting harm to sensitive we appreciate council member chuck to bringing this issue to the attention of f-sec at the last meeting and the public including columbia river keepers members and the people throughout the columbia basin who are impacted by this thank you thank you for your comments dan all right i have uh chris clark our senior sighting analyst has his hand up chris you can go ahead and unmute your own mic thank you nancy i chair girl members of council i just have a quick procedural question to put forward to the to the council's uh in response to something that ms crowley cook brought up um i have received a few just indications that people would like the opportunity to provide additional public comments on the protected areas rulemaking during that agenda item there is no public comment period uh specific to that agenda item noticed so before we conclude this comment period i just wanted to put the question to the council on whether you would like to entertain additional comments after my staff presentation in agenda item e but before you make your pres your thank you christopher um i'm gonna speak and hope that i'm not jet lagging get myself out of uh sorts and so i'm gonna look at uh secretary cornett to keep me straight i believe in vice chair speak to but i believe that we need to allow public comments in this public comment period and not later because then we're consistent with what we have communicated to the public but if i am wrong i'm looking across the way to be told otherwise madam chair um so well i believe that the app council could absolutely add a comment period during the next agenda item the protected areas rulemaking because it wasn't noticed as such i it would put people at a disadvantage who may have taken advantage of that but given the fact that this is still you know a fairly open legislative process as was already indicated in the last two commenters people can certainly comment on you know that rulemaking or other rule makings that are currently open during the regular public comment so that at least is what i think staffs feels is more appropriate thank you i concur hanley would you like to address that yeah i i would support both of you in that i think you know our public comment period is open right now",

        "text": " about that property or development that's really needed um to precipitate that removal from production so it's a very different process than what we're talking about with solar or maybe you know some other uses that Merit an exception where a certain level of Solar Development is permissible even while that property is still maintained under you know protective exclusive Farm use zoning um ostensibly because a county is found that it's not going to impact you know agricultural operations in the surrounding area the cost of agricultural operations in the surrounding area likewise any other type of Industrial Development that might be permitted say as commercial activity in conjunction with Farm use that's allowed um under the program you'll find also solar projects and other types of resources that require taking an exception to Statewide planning both free just like you would if you were changing the zoning um and so again it requires that there's something unique about that property or about the circumstances or about the proposal that merits waving you know the standards that implements those principles and policies of the Agricultural lands Protection Program I don't know if that answered your question councilwoman but there's some some differences in in some ways not there may not be differences in in when you take an exception it's a similar kind of process but um as far as the longevity of the use um you know I'm not aware of any solar wind projects that have been decommissioned where the land has been restored to an agricultural use so it'll be interesting to see how that might unfold going forward into the future thank you yeah just my thinking was is that a solar project maybe a wind um might have a lighter touch on the landscape and be able to be used in the future for farming or so thank you for that yeah so uh this is Marcy and I have a question for you or maybe an observation um no great secret that our state has endured tremendous wildfires over the last few years and I'm no meteorology expert and certainly not familiar with land use except for my experience here how do you see wildfires impacting um the lands as you as you do your work and subsequently any potential effect on um that's yeah thank you chair Grail that's a very interesting question um it comes up more in the context of uh Gulf 4 and Forest lands which has standards built into it um that address sort of the protection of um it's really protections that are really designed to protect um Timber stands um from Wild from introduction of risk that would increase um the potential for wildfires um as far as the agricultural lands program I think the conversations really you know been around restoration of agricultural lands post um introduction of Hazards and it's it's easier to restore agricultural lands than it is Forest lands um post fire so those are conversations that are sort of ongoing I don't know is there is there a different way of framing that question to her girl um it's and I I recognize it's a it's a large topic the reason I asked specifically is because as we've done uh numerous public hearings for example infrastructure are a huge deal and so when we talk about you know what happens to lands and things it's it's just a it's just an observation I think and I'll certainly uh read more about goal for we obviously keep talking about all three in our space so thank you uh for that I'll do some more research um so does anyone else have any uh additional questions for Miss Foote grail for the record the Sperry chocolate yes sir please go ahead pepper chalk too in my experience uh Klamath and Lake does all they can to go through their process to circumvent any type of guidelines for solar due to the uh problem with irrigation it all comes down to money if they can't irrigate that land because there's really no water down here we're in the middle of a massive drought this last year was you know a pretty good water year but um we're gonna have to have numerous years like this to fill the aquifer and allow irrigation as it was um so what the idea is if we can't irrigate this farmland and make money raising Alfalfa or potatoes or hay or grain let's convert it into solar and if you look through Lake County and you look through clama County you can see all kinds of solar projects coming up right in the middle of high value Farmland because it's they're constituents you know the the voting bulk of southern Oregon and so everybody wants to get voted back into office so they're going to do what they can to make sure these solar projects go through and we've got them right here in the Basin and all of it out here is a high value farmland so they say um there was a study done in the late 1800s that said the land out here wasn't fit for farming because of the high volcanic makeup of the soil the water drops right through the soil it doesn't have a high level of clay in it which would hold the water you know fairly in the surface you know that combined with uh the sense on a dollar agreement with Pacific Corps to run their pumps and pump water out on their field when that ended no six everybody was trying to figure out a different way to make money on the land and what's their answer solar and it's it's popping up all over down here I haven't seen a lot of these projects come before us at fsic so they have to be permitted by the counties so that's just my opinion on it um if you if we get a chance to come down and look ever I'll Point them out and some of them pretty expensive too so thank you for the time to talk to you I appreciate you it was a good report thank you council member talk to so Ms foot I think overall and I think we have all told you that we value what you've shared with us um and I hope that there's an opportunity for you to join us again I um it's been clear for at least me during my time on the council that your department works well with um fsex staff for us to be able to make the decisions necessary so thank you again for your for your time today and thank you very much to how our vice chair how uh chair Grill and uh Todd for inviting me here today it's been a pleasure and I'm happy to come back and talk anytime all right thank you all right well the next item on our agenda is the public comment period this is an information item this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for common items closed for comment include the Nolan Hills wind power project I will defer to Nancy uh to run this item to see if we have anyone wishing to speak thank you madam chair um I do see Angela Crowley has her hand up Angela I have unmuted your mic thank you opportunity to speak and thank you council members my name is Angela Crowley cook I'm the executive director of asea the Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association I mostly wanted to give some of our comments on the report that you just heard but before I do that I did want to note that back in the legislative report that you heard there was a question about HB 3179 and whether counties supported that bill or not and I wanted to let you know that the association of Oregon counties has come out strongly in support of that bill so Cam most counties do indeed support that piece of legislation so I wanted to talk about the report you just heard and give some other information that maybe wasn't part of the report um one thing I took away though from that great report was that 98 of our agriculture land in Oregon remains protected so when I hear that I think that's that's excellent our laws have been working we're not in a crisis when it comes to losing Farmland in Oregon but we are in a climate crisis and that's why we're seeing these new Oregon laws and these new solar projects and permits for solar projects coming in Oregon and all around the country chair Grail noted the increase in wildfires of course the climate crisis is exacerbating those wildfires droughts council member Chuck tube noted that farmers can no longer Farm due to droughts and areas of Klamath and Lake counties all of these negative impacts on the land are increasing because of the climate crisis which is why we believe that in many cases solar is an exception and deserves an exception to some of these goals because our land use law is created in that Senate Bill 100 did not take our current climate crisis into consideration um one other note um well first I want to talk a little bit about the different types of soil and land that some of these projects are on um in Klamath and Lake counties those are some of the counties you saw with the most permitted solar remember that those soils are not technically high value Farmland there are very little class one and two soils however there are class three and four soils which is what those counties would consider high value Farmland in those counties and I would argue that during these kinds of droughts when you can't Farm on some of those lands anymore solar is actually a great way to keep that land available for farming solar can be removed from the land very easily I know many members on the council have seen these utility scale projects solar projects personally and know that you literally just pull the steel out of the ground they're very different from some of the other land uses that you've seen that require sewer and and lots of buildings multiple rows that are really more permanent conversions of land solar is a temporary conversion of land if water comes back like we all hope it does in Klamath County and it's more profitable for that land to go back to farming those farmers can end their leases and um you know when the when the solar lease is up and they can return that land back to agriculture very easily so please do keep that in mind when we're talking about our current climate crisis and the balance that we really need to have to protect those lands by addressing the climate crisis um so like I said the the we we should be making some exceptions to our Landing schools really because of the climate um the report mentioned that the exception used for many of these projects is because they're close to transmission and we believe that should should be a notable exception and a worthwhile exception because our land use schools did not anticipate that being a need for projects like this and really for renewable projects so um it is it is exceptional that",

        "text": " know that's the kind of thing where we need we can have discussions about that in the participation agreement stage but this program is designed to create options around that kind of thing thank you that's that was a great question counselor that help me understand that a little bit better as well so I appreciate that I anybody have questions any members of the public have questions that we don't normally do that but things like we have people from uh home builders and chamber and folks who might have questions so I U I think one of the areas with the most known unknowns and unknown unknowns is the whole category of risk allocation people identifying the risk allocation the balance between what PGE takes as a risk and what the city takes as a risk you said one of the ways to address that is to start small uh several times you talked about I think you said a 20year agreement is that just your thought that you know locking the two agencies into a 20-y year agreement or a seveny year agreement or a 10 year agreement a five year is is there a duration that also can be used to address a risk allocation uh excellent question the reason is in 20 years is because 20 years is the standard term for a power purchase agreement um and those terms can vary occasionally you see 15 years to 25 years but I'd say the vast majority of power purchase agreements that we sign are 20 years um and so deviating from that term will increase costs okay that's helpful it gives us an idea of what what we're looking to do as far as a commitment well I and I want I want to say one more thing about um the risk allocation that I mentioned Steve can you bring that slide back up um the one that shows let's see what number is um the slide seven with the the chart what will customers pay for yes I will Steve you realize you're going to have to turn on your camera because you're like a mystery person to everybody here they I know hear you but they don't see you yeah pay no attention to the guy behind the the slides yeah and I'm sorry Riley which slide were you looking for slide seven sorry I've got way too many screens here we are seeing your slide we go there we go okay um so on this question of you know risk allocation um you know there there's a there's an assumption on this slide that pge's cost to serve all customers over the next 20 years is $60 per me wat hour but that's a forecast it will not be right like it might be 50 it might be 70 it might be some other number so PGE and all PGE customers are bearing the risk of that forecast being wrong the foreca the risk that you are all wearing is that incremental cost and also the the possibility that you know a ton of customers opt out um and costs on a per customer basis increase dramatically however we will know at the beginning you know what folks in Salem are going to be paying for over the life of the program so there will be certainty around total program cost we will not have certainty around per Bill cost because we don't know how much electricity is going to be S sold and sale exactly we certainly have forecasts but you know they're not going to be perfect um and we will not have certainty around the number of customers that choose to opt out but that bigger question of risk of well what if pge's forecasts are wrong that's a risk that all PGE customers wear not folks in the City of Salem so along those lines I know that you're currently going out or you're you're requesting another rate increase uh which is kind of on the on the heels another rate increase do you have any long-term forecasting right now like when do you anticipate doing that again after the the one that's coming up because that that would impact whether or not you know because obviously we can't just keep asking people to pay more and more and more and more and then us asking on top of that so I'm just curious like do you have any indication when what what that looks like right now you know I don't um I don't I I wish I did but I don't okay so another question what would happen if uh you know we come up this idea to do a solar farm in eastern Oregon and it's 20 million and you calculate the cost of what everyone would pay uh and that project then doubles in cost or the costs go up what happens to the customer that opted in for $5 a month or $20 a month and there's not enough funds to then create that project well so let's let's sort of Step back a little bit if something like happens the first thing that we need to look for are what are the contractual Protections in the contract with the developer of that wind farm in Oregon um because you know we we're not going to Simply say oh your cost doubled here we'll pay you um that certainly has happened on contracts in the last couple of years where because of inflation and because of supply chain constraints costs have gone up significantly um but um you know we we would look in the F in the first instance for contractual protections um but you know again like because folks in Salem you know bear the the risk of this of this of this program if there's a cost increase that can't be mitigated or that the city chooses to take on to make the program H program happen people in Salem would be on the hook but in that example you give of you know a resource cost doubling um there would almost certainly be an option for Salem to sort of just say no thanks we're out um and to reassess the program got it thank you councelor Phillips I saw your hand go up and then down is it you have question yeah I think I do um I think I've asked this question before but I forgot what the answer was um so um I is there a program now or in past where individual rate payers uh for power in in our community could kind of opt into something like this yes okay I think we we individually did that is that program still going there yes we it's called our green future program it allows individual customers to opt into a green power purchase um where and I won't get into the det of it um but during this meeting one of the benefits of remote is that um people can kind of ask questions elsewhere in PG on the side Wendy just sent me a message about 25% of Salem small residential customers are opted into that program right now which adds um a couple bucks a month to bills okay so that was my follow question is like is it okay to know what the percentage is so that gives us a sense of how many people are already doing now is it as I don't Ian I'm failing to find a better synonym for aggressive is the that individual rate payer opt in as as aggressive as like uh what kind of the thoughts we're doing with this like are there the same like is the green is it totally 100% like carbon neutral that we're we're offsetting with that opting or um it gets extremely mindly complex from an accounting perspective but what that program allows a customer to say is that their electricity is 100% okay um not necessarily carbon neutral but it's renewable I mean one one thing sort of follows from the other I'm I'm being really careful with what I'm saying because there are super complicated uh um like um rules around what you know what renewable means and what means that's all at play in this program um and those are conversations we absolutely should have at the participation agreement stage it is one of the most complex parts of my job and I'm not even going to try to get into it here here here that's fine I mean I think you've helped give me a sense of scale that it's already 25% of people that are opting into that um so like trying to get a sense of moving forward because it feels like as as a as a decision maker a policy Setter for a community what we're looking at now is opting in uh you know the entire Community for something like that and just understanding how many people start relatively supportive yeah okay last questions as we wrap up this uh portion of Thea a question yeah um so a quick question you mentioned the 25% that are already enrolled in the current program so are we looking at the other 75% is our area of opportunity or does the put a green tariff the community green tariff replace the existing so the existing 25% would be rolled into the new program or would this be on top of their program or how would that how would that interplay with those that are already unrolled uh excellent question we will not what we anticipate doing is sending a communication to customers that are are existing our existing green future program and saying hey the City of Salem has created this program you're also enrolled in green future program their green future program you can stay in both or you you can choose to unenroll from either of them um because you know we know that there are some customers that might want both we also know there are some customers that might say this makes no sense why would I pay twice we want to give customers Clarity around what's happening and also a clear choice if they want to make it that's a that's a good question Ryan zinc recognize that y you got it that was Ryan administrator so and just so and just so I because I have such a wonderful um audience I will say that prior to Juliana's arrival I really want to appreciate Brian zinc's uh support in some of the programs that you are enrolled in you are one of the few cities that's enrolled in the in our green future Enterprise program um and Ryan was really in goal along with um uh Robert Chandler they were really supportive so I want to give a shout out to them because well the mayor's in the room I appreciate that Wendy thank you little I thanks buy all right did you have one working yeah it's just a followup on that so like I want to think I understand it but like I'm not sure I do help me understand what the opportunity or the benefit is for somebody being enrolled both in the the current ly existing program like and the CommunityWide program because like I I guess I'm just stuck like wait they would be it's like the same thing but it's it's not the same thing so uh I'm",

        "text": " stack on top of each other to get us down to this decarbonization pathway or pathways that we're going to be exploring as part of this project we're also going to be looking at the data spatially so we're going to be modeling all of the different at the county level um and so oregon obviously as you all know is a very diverse uh place so you know the west is quite different from the east the north is quite different from the south so try and understand how these differences impact the amount of energy that we use and the way that we use it is important for this not only from an energy point of view for for looking at the co-benefits and equity kind of aspects of of energy and how how energy and emissions are generated within the state so all of the data that we're collecting all of the all of the the the information that we're generating is going to be county specific to be able to see kind of what the impacts of what the differences between the counties are and to be able to model those actions kind of in that in that unique way so what are stocks and flows i mentioned those earlier some stocks and flows are the building blocks of a systems dynamics model a stock is a measure of a collection of objects at a specific time and so so you can think of this as the number of buildings that you have on the ground and the number of trees that are in the forest the number of vehicles that are currently owned those are all stocks of things number of people that are in in the state um and so stocks provide balance to a system but they can also provide lag when trying to make change quickly in the system so even though you're changing things fast it takes a while for that stock to to change for for flows to move through that stock and the flow is a measure of change of a stock over a period of time so the actions that we're defining are really kind of flows we're trying to change or influence the amount of things that are moving in and out of our systems that we're looking at and the stocks are the are the are the things that we're trying to influence and these can move faster or slower depending on the size of the stock the attributes or the characteristics of that stock so in this example here you can see even though we're putting a whole bunch a hundred percent of new vehicles into the stock you can see coming out we still have a mixture of vehicles because that stock doesn't just automatically change over uh because you've changed the input it has some some resilience and some some balancing properties in there that keep that slow so when we're selecting or parameterizing the actions we need to think about not only kind of what the input it is but when that's happening because it can take a while for that stock to change over over time so the process that we've used to make this more oregon specific is that we calibrate the model and the calibration process is basically taking and tuning the model to match observed uh data that we've collected for the for the location that we're modeling so in this case we're looking at observed data at the county level and we're looking at um you know for things like observed energy energy use observed um you know number of buildings things like that so the way that the process works in this example if you look at the outputs we're looking at the the space conditioning load on a building and when we first start the model we you know we put in some assumptions because we don't know exactly where we need to start and we look at it and we say okay well obviously you know we're not going to be balanced right away the modeled energy is just different than what we so what we do is we go through the process of tuning those input input intensities so you know btus per square foot which we adjust those until we get to a place where we can say the observed energy used is matching the modeled energies and we can say at that point of time we're starting from a place that represents what's actually going on in the state at the county level and then that allows us to jump off into the simulation and make these actions that we're talking about so we know we're here and we know we wanted to a change so how can we adjust these intensities to reflect what we want to see in our new in our new pathways so obviously in a good example in the in the space conditions we want to reduce the amount of energy that we're using to to heat or cool our homes so we could say what happens if we you know we retrofit an existing home or if we make the building codes more strict for new buildings how is that that's going to translate into less energy use and what is that how is that less energy the reduction of energy is i should say translate or look like going forward into the future so we can tune those dials now based on the because we have a good starting point that represents what's going on and we can move that move that dial around going forward um any questions let's stop there for any kind of quick questions that we might have yeah we do so have some things in the chat i can go ahead and cover if that um so i see allen's getting ready to ask some questions and then we had a question from kathy moyd first why was the climate protection program included but not house bill 2021 hospital 2021 includes an electric electricity targets plus two types of community projects in green tariffs they're both they're both in there apparently okay and then um the other question from kathy was what is the criterion for the high medium and low assessment ah well we'll be close we will be getting to that maybe in a bit so let's hold off on that one and you can if there's still a question we can address that great and then but it's basically the relative quantity of greenhouse gas emission reductions and then alan gernay asks the focus seems to be on emissions resulting from energy use this leads to two questions does this include only combustion emissions and what about land conversion or land use emissions uh so yes we are including the changes in land use so sequestration is is uh one of the the elements of the actions we'll be uh we'll be modeling um i'm not sure if i guess if the for the first question let's see uh is alan uh thinking of like consumption based emissions is that the alternative that you're that you're talking about alan oh i can't hear you christine i am muted allen but not myself alan used to be able to go ahead and respond to that alan journey i said upstream emissions so we do include things like fugitive emissions from the distributed transportation and distribution of fossil fuels and those things don't go all the way up to you know the remodeling the refineries or the extraction processes or things like that rate and then we also have another question does the model include both potential emissions reductions and potential carbon sequestration from natural and working lands because i'm not sure what's meant by what do you like do you or do you do you only consider certain emissions reductions is that what you're saying potential emissions it doesn't seem that tricky to me so i'm curious it's a question about um sources excuse me natural working lands as a source of emissions as opposed to focusing on carbon sequestration is it just about potential emissions reductions from like energy and cars and that kind of thing or are we also going to include carbon sequestration uh and then lauren is followed up does it account for emissions from wetlands forests and grasslands a little bit tricky to get kind of into those details so i think we're it's going to be like abroad broadly captured as best we can we're not doing you know like a detailed forest model or grasslands kind of model down to the biogenic kind of kind of sources we're definitely mainly focusing on more of you know anthropogenic sources of using energy and combustion but we are including you know as i said as best we sequestration opportunities and change you know changes in land use and how that gets influenced so if you take you know wetlands out or re introduce light lands we can kind of model that uh and maybe kathy mcdonald kathy if you're still if you're available um yeah a little bit about natural working lands and sequestration how we're handling it in this yeah happy to um you know i think we can consider emissions as well as sequestration from natural and working i think um you know the level of detail that we may go to uh may stay focused on the kind of big areas of emissions and sequestration potential but i think we want to be comprehensive to the natural and working recommendations that the commission made this summer and just to follow up on that um again the list is online if if folks would like to take a look at what is there right now and we will you know keep part of this process too is there will be facilitation to include um additional ideas of what hasn't been captured that oregonians feel strongly about including so thank you again for that question great and then we still have a few more questions that have come in so um helen wants to know if the mat curves are for each year or if we adjust for business as usual increases and emissions as a business as business production and transportation grows as well as do we just build one mac curve or does it get um does it get updated so so the mac curve rep like the cost and the mac curve represent a span of time and you take a net present value at and each each action can have different discount rates depending on you know the sector it's trying to to uh to represent but so yeah so the time frame will be is basically brought down to one number uh using the net present value calculation so that discounts any costs going into the into the future um and um and yeah so that's how that works and then just quickly going back to the last conversation just noting that we have an official request here that emissions not just sequestration from natural and working lands get included so um if one of our friends at ssg is taking notes today can make sure that gets captured and then um also kathy brought up that her question about whether or not house bill 2021 was included was based on the spreadsheet and i think i see a couple places where i see it but it doesn't say house bill

        "text": " to have any questions that may have come in so far or if anyone has their hands raised no questions in the chat so far jen all right we'll go ahead and move along so the funding opportunity that brings us here today and the purpose of these funds as outlined by the u.s department of energy is to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events it's also to generate the greatest community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of those and to advance the department of energy's equity environmental and energy justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative in pursuit of all that it provides opportunities to invest in the american a little bit of timing information regarding this opportunity um for the application that opened up on july 6th and we've been working on preparing the proposed narrative that we'll be going over in depth today but our application will be due to the u.s department of energy on september and just to clarify that the oregon department of energy will be the entity um the agency for the state that applies receives and administers this particular set of funding so how this works in context is there's really a sort of a a two-step process states tribes and territories will be able to apply to the federal u.s department of energy to receive funds and under the intent of those funds states in particular have to propose methods and criteria under which we will invest these dollars to further the goals of the program and we'll do that through a grant making program to eligible entities and so um as a state we'll be making grants to the eligible entities that will be described a little bit the funding opportunity announcement permits these eligible entities to be amongst this list and could provide some flexibility for future years as well and so essentially it'll be a two-step process where the state will receive the funds and then the vast majority of those funds will be granted out even further within the state so under this funding opportunity announcement we do have some information regarding our allocation at least for the first year of the program and so oregon's allocation is just shy of 10 million dollars as you can see the specific amount there and we do anticipate an allocation to continue each year for a five-year period um the overall amount of how much oregon set to receive is part of a five-part formula that the us department of energy has provided and may be refining in years to come in addition to the federal funds that are available under this opportunity there are also requirements of match and in the um just to provide a little context of what match dollars means is essentially it's it's funding that a state or tribe as the applicant to the us department of energy would need to provide to align with the scope of this so that they are able to bring in those dollars to show that they're contributing as well to the project and for states and tribes the match requirement is 15 of the federal funds so for oregon what that translates to is just a little shy of 1.5 million dollars for the first year in addition to the match requirement for states and tribes there is additional requirements that sub-recipients of the funds so the eligible entities that will be receiving the funds to really do the investment work under this will also have to contribute matching um matching dollars towards the scopes of the so um the sub-recipient match that will be based on the size of the eligible entity and that's based on their sales of electricity per year and so you can see the threshold there is um for 4 million megawatt hours that basically if an entity is above that they have to provide match at a 100 rate and if they are below that they have to match at a rate of one-third of the federal funds so what these dollars can do these dollars are able to be invested in quite a suite of eligible measures everything from weatherization technologies and equipment to utility pole management to adaptive protection technologies and the replacement of old overhead conductors and underground this list of eligible activities is inclusive so it's not fully exhaustive of everything that may be conceived under under these applications or under this program but there are a few things that is expressly prohibited to be used that these dollars cannot be used for and those are listed at the bottom of the slide here it's resilience resilience measures cannot include construction of a new electric generating facility or a large-scale battery storage facility that's not used for enhancing system adaptive capacity during disruptive events or cyber security with these funds since they are federal in in nature there will be federal requirements that apply to all of the and these requirements involve regular reports on financial status project progression and metrics and in addition to that there are various terms and conditions that potential applicants may want to familiar familiarize themselves with those include the davis bacon act requirement for workers the national environmental policy act build america by america act and just the general understanding that these projects are subject to monitoring and audits by both the oregon department of energy and the us department of and um this is not a fully exhaustive list of all the terms and conditions but that will be available um in the future so with that i'd like to see if there are any additional questions that have been raised thanks jen i'm not seeing any questions in the chat and there are no hands up at this time thank you all right great thank you janine and jen and good afternoon everyone i'm gonna now walk you through some of the core elements of our draft proposal that we intend to sit submit to usdoe at the end of next month so before i get started as has been mentioned a few times already i just want to keep in mind that this is still a draw proposal what we have here what we're going to walk through is not set in stone and we really are still looking for feedback and input so keep that in mind as you hear the elements we propose so for year one uh really looking at a provisional approach uh what we're for the first year of the five year program should be thought of as provisional and targeted why we have a short timeline to stand this program up and get an application to usdoe by september 30th so again thank you for your contribution so far and again today and in written comments you may submit for helping contribute to this another reason for this is the diversity of investment types so you saw the long list of eligible investments that can be funded by this program and then that's a complicated factor for us how do we compare underground in a power line near mount hood with a microgrid in medford with the need for more extensive vegetation management outside of bend in many ways these types of investments are apples and oranges and comparing them competitively require a thoughtful complex scoring system to identify varying levels of community benefit with each investment so instead for year one here's what we're focused on uh administrative efficiency not just for odo but also for our applicants we're seeking to invest in actionable utility projects that are ready to go and we're looking to commit all of oregon's allocated funds so we leave nothing on the table otherwise usd we can recapture those funds and have them go to other states and then importantly also taking the time in year one and we try to lay out a thoughtful approach in the narrative to convene stakeholders to inform a more robust nuanced approach for years two through five so for those uh future years of the program what we're really looking to do is have a process to identify a stakeholder advisory committee in year one that can inform the development of objectives and metrics for those future years to prioritize projects that are identified by and located within disadvantaged communities in alignment with the justice 40 initiative that address multiple grid disruptions associated with multiple hazards so not just wildfires as is our focus for year and then also that aligns with mitigation strategies identified by the state's energy security plan which is just really beginning and is in progress and with other other efforts in the state such as the iou's clean energy plans that are underway at the puc next slide please so let's dig in a little more on our proposed provisional approach for year the preliminary objectives we've identified for year one so first around wildfire as we've mentioned we really want to focus on making investments in wildfire risk mitigation either in areas of the state recently impacted by wildfire or those areas that are at high risk of wildfire two really focusing on community benefits so maximizing benefits by addressing projects that either address that wildfire risk or locating projects in disadvantaged communities uh also identifying projects that are ready to go so we're looking to support investment in projects that are really ready to go and can deliver immediate community benefits so this is an area i'd mentioned that we're really looking for some feedback what's the best way for roto to evaluate the project is really ready to go so i'd be i'd be curious to get input from utilities on that labor as a requirement to the funding we're looking to invest in projects that meet strong labor protections and and then again as i uh hinted on the previous slide really looking at preparing ourselves for years two through five with designing objectives and metrics that address a more robust set of criteria next slide please now let's talk a little bit about the funds that will be available as jen mentioned earlier uh oregon's formula allocation of funds is expect to be just shy of 10 million dollars per year or roughly 50 million over the course of five years there's also that 15 state match with which jen mentioned earlier and we have a process in place where we're going to be going to the legislative e-board here in a couple of weeks to request match funds for this first year of the program uh when match sources are confirmed odo will provide information on the use of these funds it's possible for instance uh then more than 10 million dollars will end up being available for grant awards after incorporating this match but it's yet to be determined what the match fund would look like uh there's also a note on the federal funds there's a limitation that no more the five percent of the federal funds can be used for program administration tech assistance and information sharing so at minimum 95 of those federal funds will be available as direct grant awards to utilities there's also a small utility set-aside required by the funding the the way the the language is written is that a minimum amount of grant funds must be made available to small utilities equal to no less than the percentage of customers served by those in oregon",

        "text": " to make findings or impose conditions on all applicable Council standards and then uh following that completeness determination on January 3rd 20 24 the applicant filed a complete application with the following uh this the completeness determination by the department the department uh provided notice to reviewing agencies and the public of um and let's see this meeting tonight the public information meeting uh is not a comment time frame but uh we hold this meeting voluntarily to uh explain the project in the process now that we've gotten to completeness but I want to just uh reiterate that or or explain that a complete application is not an approval or an approved uh facility it's just that we've deemed that there's enough information for Council to make findings or impose conditions so we're still only at the third step of the process for application requirements and Council standards every project has to meet the same 14 General standards uh the magnitude of what an applicant has to provide to document that they've met the burden of proof for each standard varies based on the type of energy facility and the location of the project although what you see here on the screen is just a snapshot of a larger table from a department handout um I wanted to clarify that there is a between exhibits in division 21 and applicable uh Council standard which are division 22 in in rule um for example the information provided in uh W waste minimization May uh correspond with both the waste minimization standard or also uh the Public Services standard so although it's exhibit it could sprinkle into multiple standards whereas the information provided in exhibit s historic cultural and resources uh most closely corresponds with one standard and that's the historic cultural and archaeological standard now I mentioned that this is just a snippet of a of a larger handout that larger handout which features all of the exhibits and corresponding standards can be found on the fact sheets portion of the department's website all right touching back on the draft proposed order uh based on the complete application the department will prepare the draft proposed order which contains the Department's recommended findings of compliance or non-compliance with the sighting standards as well as the conditions we recommend the council to impose under each of those standards once the Department issues its draft proposed order another round of public involvement is initiated uh there is as I've mentioned a public hearing associated with this phase and this would allow or is it or is intended to allow anyone to comment on whether staff's initial recommendation in the draft proposed order is correct a hearing officer conducts a public hearing conducts the public hearing on the draft proposed order where members of the public and reviewing agencies have the opportunity to testify at the hearing or or submit written comments by an established okay public participation at the DPO phase um anyone who participates during this phase at the hearing um or during the comment period uh well I guess anyone that wants to participate Beyond this phase beyond the DPO phase must raise an issue either in person or at the the hear in in person at the public hearing or by submitting a written comment to Odo before the uh DPO comment period uh deadline is before the DPO comment deadline failure to raise a relevant issue either orally at the hearing or in a timely submitted written comment uh precludes further participation in the fsec process so in order to participate post DPO phase so in the proposed order phase or in contested case phase you must participate during the DPO phase and within the DPO comment time frame persons interested in being considered for party status in the contested case proceeding must meet two criteria the first relates to timing as I just mentioned to be eligible to participate in a contestent case on the application a person must raise an issue either in person at the DPO hearing or in a written comment submitted during the comment time frame um before the record closes at the conclusion of the de at the conclusion of the the comment time frame the council will not accept comments after the close of the record um um on the the DPO the second criteria relates to the content for comments for consideration in the contested case issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction it must be raised with sufficient specificity so that the council the department and the applicant understand the issues raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on issue all comments submitted in a timely fashion will be reviewed by Odo and the council besides providing commenters with the opportunity to be eligible to be considered for party status in the contest case proceeding timely and specific comments that point out issues with the application or the draft proposed order provide the department the opportunity to address these issues when we develop the proposed order now on this screen we have um examples of the types of comments that would help Odo improve its analysis for the proposed order and those those uh examples are provided on the left side of the screen and on the right side of the screen the right hand column those these are comments that are uh less likely to help us improve our analysis of whether or not the facility complies with Council standards because this is a process comments that reference specific Council standards and provide specific information supporting whether or not a standard has been met are more likely to improve our analysis than statements of support or of opposition to the facility so the more detailed and linked to council standards a comment can be the more effective it is for us to evaluate and address uh further on down the line This is a screenshot of the project web page for the wagon trail solar project and uh in a couple slides I'll provide this web page link it was also provided in the public notice for this meeting tonight the web page um contains not only a copy of this participation but also so the Department's project order and the applicant application materials for the wagon trail soar project the page uh will be updated when we post additional or new documents such as when we issue the draft proposed order it'll be updated it'll also be updated um following this meeting to include the recording of this um but currently the applicants application for site certificate is uh featured on the web page and included in this screenshot you can see a exhibit files reference on the right hand side and this is uh this exhibit files reference is there to support your uh review of the application materials the complete application materials are uh again featured on this website but this is just a quick uh reference point to see uh identif or address What U subject material the the department also has created a lot of information that we hope will be helpful our website contains a public guide and a series of handouts to explain how the fsec process works and how to participate in our process there are also options to sign up and receive email notices and uh instructions on how to comment on citing projects to be automatically notified for updates or on updates for this project or any FSC project you can sign up for our click Dimensions email notices The Click Dimensions email system uh will provide you with an uh an when there's updates to specific projects or Council meetings or rule makings um or a combination of all all those let's see now this before I hand over my presentation to the applicant this next slide is just my contact info um but I my contact info will be uh shown at the conclusion of the presentation so I won't linger too long on this and we'll uh hand it over to the applicant to go over their see hey Chase thank you and I just want to say uh thank you for all the work you put into getting this meeting together and all the hours that you and the department of energy staff have put into getting the application to complete this um just to introduce myself I'm Ryan Hill I'm a developer for the wagon trail solar project and and a senior project manager at next era energy resources um I'd also like to introduce my director David Lawler uh David you want to just introduce yourself real quick yeah David Lawler I'm the regional director for development at nextera energy resources and um I'm glad glad to be part of this uh this uh public meeting all right thank you and uh kind of how our slides are going to run going to be kind of a big picture of who next era is uh funling down to more Project Specific details uh if we could just go to the next slide please right so Wagon Trail Energy Center is a subsidiary of nexera energy resources and kind of our background as nexera energy resources are we are one of the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar and a leader in battery storage technology um as you can see in the map everything highlighted green are the provinces and states where we have operating assets and projects and then to the right the pie chart that's kind of a breakdown of where our energy comes from um and then just a caveat the 9% of purple that's other most of that is from natural gas all right next slide please so kind of drilling down into uh this map kind of shows on a Continuum of where projects are and kind of that we all over the state right so everything you see in red is kind of a early stage development project the Orange is moving into late stage um which is what Wagon Trail is now and then the green are operating assets so just wanted to show that you know we're not just in northeastern Oregon we're all over the state as well next slide please all right and so for our operating uh energy centers we have three wind operating uh currently uh close to this project we have Wheat Ridge 1 Wheat Ridge 2 and assumed to be Wheat Ridge East all wind projects operating in the mo or Wheat Ridge one and two are operating Wheat Ridge East uh we'll move into construction uh later this year uh additionally we have something that's kind of unique for the ren able energies and that's a trifecta and that's also located um with the Wheat Ridge wind facilities we also have solar and energy storage in more County as well uh and we just kind of threw up some stats of kind of our investment in the community and in Oregon uh based on our capital and expenditure uh our taxes our landowner payments right they're all big numbers but the biggest thing we focus on is uh we like to be a part of the community sponsor local events uh such as Hepner Rodeo was probably my favorite of this year next slide please all right and here's just kind of a line item that brings",

        "text": " sure you guys are all aware of that. Okay. And, and you can, we can check with staff on this as well. But if, if they were to change it to rc one, there are more requirements on that land to hold its own water. It, like with agriculture the way it is, it can well I know blood you, but rain, you know, but what I'm. All I'm saying is they engineer it. They'd have to engineer it. So it would be advantageous. It would have to be, yeah. For your 880ft of. It'd be advantageous to have more restrictions on that property than there currently is? Well, yeah, because the. The section that you're talking about is basically below land. We understand that part. All right, thank you. Yes, sir. My name is Gregory Bean. I'm sorry, name. Sorry, I missed. Name is Gregory Bean, live at 750 Northeast 165th street in Central. I basically came here on kind of a fact finding mission in that we have asked for several years. Willie, what is your intention for the property? This is prior to the illegal clearing of the property, which was a code violation. That was a beautiful piece of property, and it got cleared to asphalt. We can't get any straight answers as to what's his plan is for going in there. The reason why I asked that we want to know ahead of time. We had quite a battle with the racetrack situation. I live just up the street from this property, and I want to know what's going to go in there. So I know, how do I feel about it? You can't get a straight answer. I think you tried to ask, what are you going to do with it? You don't get an answer. So that's why I'm here. I'm in most opposition to any more development of that area. If I'm not mistaken, that nine acres is already RC one. Everything that can happen in RC one, they're allowed to do so to why they can't answer. Your question is it'd be broad. It's everything you can do in RC one on that amount of land, whatever that is from. We just heard it. Restaurants. The list is. The list is long. What they can already do with the nine acres that is there. So sit back and watch. Well, you know, that's one way to put it, I guess. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And by the way, you threw me off and I thought we've got the same name. That's what threw me at the beginning. Gregory. Ah, come on. Yes, sir. My name is Brian Watros. Same address as my dad, 16 250 north US Highway 301. And it's basically the same thing. Just about what he wants to do with the property on that. On that spot. We just want to make sure our land that we work hard for and we pay for just as long as you guys do, too, is safe and isn't going to get dangered mostly because animals, everything we have. We have kids. Yeah, he can put ever he wants there. But we are friends. He does use our driveway this whole time during everything. So we just like an answer from him. But again, I mean, I think he said it. He'd like to sell it at some point and let somebody else decide what they wanted to do. Bottom line. And I think that property over the past, at least several sales has been from investors. What at least what I know about it. And so that list of things that can happen on RC one, what we're talking about is there's one corner of it back there, one acre and bottom looking at a bottom left hand corner that doesn't conform with the rest of it. And it's like, do we leave it out and let it be one acre of nothing for, for eternity because it's landlocked from it? Or do we, you know, have it compared? No, I got the bottom line. I understand that everything he already has is already approved for the RC, but it's what's not approved? Just that one acres. Not just. Yeah, just that one acre. We're just work because that runs exactly down our whole fence line. So we're just making, it's just a corner, right. That's our whole, that's our whole fence line that our house is right there with the big square. That whole line that he wants is our whole fence line. And just to confirm this, this portion is not landlocked at all. This is one giant parcel. This is a one with rural land use. This could, this could have a house on it right now. So it's not landlocked. Is landlocked. Ever try to, if, you know, you couldn't sell it, obviously, because it's conforming, but it's back there with something separate. If you ever were allowed to for some reason sell it, it's landlocked. He could sell it to us. I don't think he can sell it. That's potential. It would be, if he could sell it, it would be landlocked. If the neighbor wants to buy it, there may be maybe part of your investment. It goes right there, driveway. All right. And would anyone else like to speak in opposition to this? All right. Seeing none, I'll close the floor to public comment. Would the board like to have any more discussion or would someone like to tackle a motion and see which direction this is headed? I just want to say that, you know, the r one, that that rc one is, it's, it doesn't belong there in the first place. You're beating a dead horse. Yeah, well, we're supposed to stick to our. No, I'm. It's relative. Relative. Let me make a motion and see what happens. All right, go ahead. I, Jerry Lorenco, disagree with staff's findings and recommendation. Hereby recommend approval of the requested rezoning based on the following will not adversely affect the public interest, is consistent with Marion county comprehensive plan, and is compatible with surrounding land use. Okay, we have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll second it. Okay, we have a motion and a second. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. So is it. No. No. Okay, so it's. Did you get that count? It's a split decision for you. That worked out perfect for us. Yeah, it worked perfect for everyone. It's a split decision. It'll go. It's 42. Three, four. Didn't you vote for it? He voted to second it and I voted in favor of it. So there's four against two. No. Oh, he voted. I voted no. Oh, you voted on your side? Oh, yeah. Okay, I'll be out of my. So it's going to go as a split recommendation to the board of county commissioners. Make sure you're back on July 7. July 1602:00 in this room. Same with you folks out there. Make sure that you come back and you'll have your voice again. So each side did pretty good. You each got part of it. So any other questions? I'll ask the staff after the meeting. Okay. Thank you. All right, we'll move on to 2.3. Thank you all for coming. If you would check with staff real quick while that where we have this coming up, just to keep the ball rolling. There you go. So this is concurrent with a zoning change. 24 0712 zC. That application is being withdrawn. We are going to work with the applicant and come forward with a special use permit if the land use is approved. So we're only hearing the land use tonight. The zoning change is going to be withdrawn. I don't have that information to it, but we're listening to the land use change. Yeah, there's a two part. There's both 2.3 and 2.4. Item 2.4 is the one that is being withdrawn. We're looking at 2.3. We're looking at 2.3. Okay. Okay. So item 2.3 is case number twenty four. S zero six. Applicant being David Reynolds. Property is roughly 2.27 acres in size. The request is changing the future land use from rural land to commercial property. Address is 6885 Southeast Highway. 42, Summerfield, Florida. No letters of opposition or support have been received. Six neighbors have been notified. So this is at the inter. This is at the intersection of 301 and Highway 42. This is largely a commercial intersection, but is largely underdeveloped. The property is outside of the urban gross boundary, located within the secondary springs protection zone. Under our comprehensive plan, rural area does not accommodate increased development potential, and development here encourages proliferation of urban sprawl under state statute. This and commercial intersection. So this is what it looks like currently with the b has b two zoning currently and a future land use of rural land. Proposed zoning will ignore that. Let's just imagine this is b two and then proposed future land use would be commercial. Big thing when looking at this is, yes, there's a lot of commercial here, but when we as staff have to do our analysis of adding more commercial to an intersection, we have to look at how much of it is built out to its potential at the moment, and it's significantly underdeveloped. That's not to say that at five years that might change, but at this time, we don't have a timeline of when it would be built out. And so flu policy 1.15 is on higher intensity, intensity of uses. So typically we want to see that within the urban gross boundary and within",

        "text": " the notice of intent um the intent is just that it is a longer linear facility to have kind of uh it's kind of like a reasonable factor um and this is just in conversations in our understanding with the people that did establish that because it happened prior to sarah and i being here but that that because it is this long you know 274 mile linear facility that a reasonable analysis area that basically going out a mile would just be a really big and maybe unnecessary this is and this is just from my understanding we don't actually have anything in the record that has a basis or a reason for it okay secretary cornett i believe we're ready for the straw poll okay this would be to agree with the findings so for the record todd cornett uh agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue nc one ken howe and buyer henley jenkins jordan truitt barry choctoot cindy condon thank you council members the next issue is issue nc2 we have several limited parties associated with this issue stopped b to h gilbert and horst all three of these limited parties filed exceptions the issue is whether the department aired in recommending that the council grant a variance slash exception from the organ deq's noise rules and whether the variance exception is inconsistent with ors 467.010 so the hearing officer's opinion on this issue um first notes uh one of the council's um statutes or which establishes that the council must determine whether the proposed facility complies with any additional statutes rules or ordinances determined to be applicable to the facility by the project order as amended so again this is setting the stage that these noise rules come from another source of law and not the own rules in the first instance but the deq noise ors 469 401 establishes the council's authority in consolidating other permits or permit requirements into the site based on these statutes taken together the council has the jurisdiction and authority to determine whether the proposed facility meets deq's noise control regulation requirements for an exception and or a variance from the ambient anti-degradation standard and that standard is a limit not to exceed more than 10 dba above the baseline ambient noise levels in any one hour and further that the council is not required to consult with the environmental quality commission or deq in making its determination the hearing officer found that 30 years the environmental quality commission and deq suspended their responsibilities for administrating the noise program essentially this places the council as the sole authority um to make findings and rules on an applicant's request for variance and exception just as it to the council's authority to make decisions with respect to any aspect of the noise rules that may apply here the hearing officer found that the limited parties presented no persuasive evidence that the department's recommendation that the council grant a variance or exception was an error the hearing officer found that exceedances of the ambient degradation standard meet the criteria for being considered unusual or infrequent because it would occur less than two percent of the time only during foul weather where foul weather is infrequent in the project area and at times of low ambient noise levels and when the transmission line is operating at full capacity 467-010 which is the legislative policy behind the noise control rules states is to provide protection of the health safety and welfare of oregon citizens from the hazards and deterioration of the quality of life imposed by excessive noise emissions the hearing officer found that the proposed facility will not present a threat to the environmental quality of life in this state the department further that the department appropriately considered the under ora 0 sub 340-35-00102 the hearing officer also noted the noise conditions have been imposed here noise condition one uh which is a preconceived reconstruction requirement to work with known nsrs where exceedances would occur and agree and implement noise impact related mitigation and second a post-construction requirement to evaluate any noise complaints and implement noise impact related mitigation if the complaint is deemed valid includes a council review component if any disputes on the level of mitigation end up being unresolved that with these conditions that are included in the proposed contested case order that this would result in the protection of health safety and welfare of organ citizens so that is the summary so again we have uh three parties who filed exceptions on this issue and they can present oral argument in the order that they choose good morning irene gilbert here um knowing you're going to deny my request for exception on this based on and you've also denied all procedural arguments i'm going to kind of focus some on the procedural issues that relate to this particular this is one of many issues when the administrative law judge used procedures to hamstring the public participation in contested cases my contested case in regard is in regard to whether it's appropriate for council to authorize an exception and variance to the deq's rules and this is one example because obviously in order to decide if you're going to be able to issue an exception you have to know what the noise uh effects are and i was denied any arguments regarding the methodology or the establishment of what the actual noise impacts are going to be which makes it very difficult to justify an exception and they if you look at the noise issue it is it's one issue and yet you see four actually there were a couple of other uh uh issues if you will which were really just pieces of the noise so um anyway when you there are a couple of court decisions one is dlcd versus tillamook county which says divisions um decisions stating petitioners need not have raised individual arguments regarding my issue what what um court decision said was you don't have to give all the details all you have to do is raise the broad issue and the other another one here says that this is with league of women voters says that individual arguments regarding an issue on appeal cannot be expended so the fact that they have thrown out everything in my contest case on exception or variance that had to do with what the actual noise levels are and whether or not that was identified is not going to hold water and appeal the um let's see i wanted to also state that i might insert anyway the fact that there's no deference to an agency when it comes to interpreting another agency's rules or statutes and actually the statute specifically says that the rules how the rules are supposed to be established by deq and the deq rules have to cover specific items and that they are in effect the statute because the statute is so clear that it says you will determine how you're going to how you're going to measure it how you're going to interpret it it's that specific the other thing so i was going to talk about unusual and infrequent uh odo reinterpreted the idea about what how much noise level the exceedance there is and the rules it clearly says that when the corona noise is exceeding the ambient degradation standard they're talking about how many days and it specifically says any hour within a 24-hour period if there's an exceedance there's an exceedance of this standard so in union county that means that 35 days out of every year we could expect the weather to be getting basis instead of looking at it that way what the developer did is they said well if we look at the amount of um days or not the amount of days but the look at it as a block of time so if we were to have this this weather pattern for four days in a row then it would be just a minor uh event in a 365-day year that's not what the rules say the rules say one hour within any 24-hour period if there's an exceedance there's an exceedance that is not infrequent thanksgiving thank you any questions from council excuse me just real quickly this is the court reporter i just want to let you know that there's starting to be some disruption in the wi-fi okay thank you so for the record todd cornett just checking did you were able to hear the entire testimony yes it was questionable but it did come through but it was just kind of like uh in and out in and out okay we we've turned off the video to make sure that we have the bandwidth so again please let us know if you have any interruptions thank you i will we're ready for the next on behalf of stop you have several issues embedded in this particular one one of them is legal question of the department or the council take over the authority of deq and eqc to grant a variance our position is very simple you could go to them or the applicant could go to them and say will you let us do this because you're no longer administering the program and if they say heck yeah we're no longer doing anything then you have authority if you don't do that you can't just usurp the authority of another agency and say hey we're going to do that stuff because we don't think they will so that's pretty much a straightforward legal question we don't think you have that authority odo argues that you do i think we'll ultimately end up having to see how an appellate court views that we don't think the grant of authority is that broad secondary issues you have here is does the applicant's materials and the department's analysis actually meet the requirements for a variance or an exception and if there is one should it be for the entire line or should it be based on individual nsrs where the actual high levels of noise will occur our position on the ladder is very straightforward you shouldn't be granting anybody an exemption for an entire facility that goes for to almost 300 miles it should be focused on the nsrs where there actually are exceedances as to the whether they meet the standard they don't as ms gilbert just noted that there isn't an infrequent issue here because it's 48 days if you're in union county that's not infrequent there's also no special circumstances here that render compliance and practical there are other routes where there wouldn't be this problem uh one of them would be the nepa route but the other routes would make this perfectly feasible there's also exception allowed if substantial compliance would result in substantial controlment or closing down of the business well the business doesn't exist right now i wouldn't be closing anything down and if the applicant can't comply with the noise standards then they shouldn't be building the line you shouldn't be approving things because simply because the applicant can't meet",

        "text": " the ability during the day, and I believe at all times, unless I'm incorrect. Okay, so, yeah, so that is inside we're going to have sound damping material. We currently don't be a CMU block wall with sound dampening material to stop and have those first and second reverberations adjusted before it dissipates out. Now, we've had two different community meetings out there. Each time we've shared which. That yellow circle, as you see on the concept diagram, that is a mathematical equation that if you had 115 decibels from the center of that property, that it will dissipate to 50 to 60 decibels at 1000ft. That's a 2000 foot diameter with no obstruction whatsoever. So we didn't count for the trees, we don't count for the buildings. So the next step to answer that question is to do sound mapping. So in our next phase, we start to understand where those buildings will be. We can do sound mapping, which is what engineers do when you talk about I 75 and hey have to buy you windows if you're at a certain decibel rating. We would do the exact same study. We can move buildings around, situate them, angle them differently to see how that sound disperses out, and then do physical studies using that sound and see what those ratings are at the perimeter of our properties. And is there anything that we can put at the perimeter of the property to help with sound abatement? Yeah, and so that's going to be part of that. Once we know what the levels are going to be, you'll see there are some landscaping buffers, which are large trees. All that stuff is going to absorb and disperse sound, but the goal is to not get it there in the first place. So we're going to try to do put the majority of our efforts at the location where the sound is originates. So. Yes. Excuse me. Go ahead. Okay, Jared. Also, when we build, you know, those things and those runs, I have seen some other designs as I've just been looking, where we can put the building basically toward the outside of the perimeter, you know, and then some of the runs can be kind of in the inside. Right. So you're. You're also putting the animal, if it's outside, you know, it has to go through a building, has to go through the thing, has to go through the land. Right. So if we design them for an, you know, sometimes an internal perspective, at least that's one thing we think. Right. External then would be the inside. And then, yeah, you might have an awning, something that covers it. Still consider an outdoor kennel. Right. But yes, it could reduce that sound attenuation. From that point, everything we do and everything we design could be with the intent to block sound, to going out to the neighbors. That's all right. So the only non permissible use that's making us do the special use is the kennels. So it's the kennel and for domestic animals. And there's the wastewater aspect as well. And what, the wastewater aspect is also on there. Yeah. So, but that is permissible in the land development code. It's four 2.3 c. And that is what the special use permit is for, is to go in line with that land use code. Now, go over again, if you don't mind, the wastewater treatment plant and how we will deal with. I mean, you've got to clean those kennels out. Explain that process of how that's dealt with. The majority of the solids are picked up and then they are transferred off site. The stuff that isn't picked up and washed down will go down. The same waste that we have for our normal buildings, that'll go into a small wastewater reclamation plant that you see on the site to the northeast, that is a nitrogen reducing system. It has to be permitted by Department of Health, has to be permitted by Florida Department of Environmental Protection, has to be monitored monthly, reported on, has to be repermitted every five years to make sure that effluent is below the limit, which is far superior to a regular septic system. And right now at our current facility, we have the solids picked up and they are hauled off. We're under contract with a business that does that. Yeah. And so we also have a kind of a collection tank, too, where the solids will collect and it gets pumped out every, whenever based on use. The same thing. I mean. I mean, really, commissioner, I mean, everybody around there, right? I mean, we're doing hundreds of thousands of yards of manure in Marion county every month, right, from different farms and different, you know, whether it's composting, whether it's this, that. So, I mean, that part of the business is nothing complicated, right. It's pretty easy. It's done all the time, and it's not going to create significant odor and the way we're going to do it is way better than the way most people tend to practice that issue today. Let me ask you, number one, I contacted the sheriff. He's not anticipating using this property for any of his horses or animals. Just to get that out there. From a time frame standpoint, if this goes through, what will be the anticipated time that we can have the facility up and running and get away from the existing facility? Yeah. So up front and have some follow up? Yeah, it would be. The quick move was animal control. They'd like to get animal control into the house to the west. That way they can operate out of that property. We're looking at the three to four year timeline before the entire thing would swap over. How much? Three to four years. So if we don't do this property and we go out and start looking again, what are we looking at, 6000? We're down the road a little bit. We do have some conceptuals. We've done the RFQ, we have the team on staff. All those processes take months. Okay. Cost, we've been talking $14 million. Yeah, we're at 13. Five, six. That include the property? No, sir. That's excluding the property which is valued at 3 million. You and I talked about potential mitigation for the noise and we don't have a factor for that yet. Right. And that's one of the concerns. You see a property this size, when we gave the original assessment it was how do we model after, I believe it was Lake county. Right. And a little bit larger than Lake county. But we didn't anticipate to have a piece of property this large. When we get a piece of property this large, you can see just some of the landscaping. Depending on what type of trees we decide it's a lot. I mean, you could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars just to provide a beautiful landscape to what we've committed to the neighborhood of saying, hey, we're going to be the best neighbor possible and if we're going to move in and put these things in place, we could be in the hundreds of thousands plus just for the sound attenuation. Absolutely. Gary, did I hear you right? Did you say 50 decibels at 1000ft? Yes, sir. So it's between 50 and 60 decibels. Was that original study and that was through a UF tool. There's a lot more in depth sound modeling that we plan on doing once we understand exactly what we need. That's without mitigation efforts that we could do, correct? Yeah. And that's actually, without any buildings whatsoever, that's if that sound were to go off, that's what it would dissipate naturally across the property. So what will it be at that 2000 foot circle? To Commissioner McLean's question. So it's logarithmic. Right. So it's not just like we have to do the study. And so our goal is. I can tell you that a one, they don't have a sound ordinance. Right. They're exempt from it. But the ordinance is between 07:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. it's 65 decibels. And after that time at night, it's 55 decibels. Those would be the guidelines we would be shooting for. And lower than that. Did that study give any kind of. What does that sound like, that study say anything about what that's comparable to 55. Yeah. So normal talking voices. They said 50 decibels is like when you hear your refrigerator running that low hum. That's 50 decibels. Yeah. Now, Jared, here's the question. I know a one does not have anything regarding sound, but our sound ordinance would apply to this project, correct? In the ag zone. It would not. Our kennels would so. And that's 13.7 of our go ahead use. Yeah, it could. If we don't comply with the conditions of the special use, then we are at risk of having the special use pulled, which is why we're doing this whole hearing anyway, to put, should it pass, to put conditions on our future, our use, this whole thing is to put conditions on ourselves so that if we move it forward, we're good neighbors. I mean, otherwise the easiest thing for us to do would have not to do this at all. Right? It would have just gone in there, changed the use to government, and we could put whatever use we wanted to in there if we changed it to government, which is the wrong thing to do for the community. Right. And it's the wrong thing to do in general, because that's not good. And then that would allow us to run whatever we wanted in there. Right. We could. If",

chair white wall you're good it sounds good but that's what you said all right commissioner montovo here commissioner Capco here Michigan Barnes commissioner beans here yeah it looks like uh commissioner Kai is absence thank you very much our first agenda item is the consent or June 27th 2023 our regular meeting before we take a motion I turned in uh three scrivener errors to Erica prior to the meeting thank you so I'm an Entertainer emotion I'll move that we accept the uh consent agenda with uh Scribner edits so all right it's been moved in second at any discussion all in favor say aye uh opposed motion carries Council liaison announcement councilor thank you thank you for joining us uh good evening sir Simpson and uh thank Planning Commission members council meeting we approved the Sherwood West concept plan and we will be moving forward with the next steps of that now it passed unanimously and I want to thank you for your hard work with that other thing that came up during our um cultivating last week was the work sessions for the food cart we are going to send that to you to get some guidance um the main focus was design standards for the street facing components for this food cart area um to cover colors as well as signage for the street facing food carts just so that it looks feeling too uh you know our Sherwood standards and that is all I have for you guys this evening thank you very much staff announcements Eric yeah thanks good evening um I have a couple announcements uh last Tuesday this state Council I accepted the Sherwood West concept plan so thank all of you again for all of your hard work that you put into that plan um our next meeting will be August 8th and we have two topics for that work session and it will start at 6 15. um our first topic is we'll be giving an update we'll be having a discussion on the climate-friendly Equitable communities rules and work that the city will be doing over the next year and then as counselor Suzuki stated uh the city council um had you know has directed planning staff to move forward with food cart regulations for Sherwood and so we have a draft development code that has already been reviewed by the city council during a couple work sessions and we're going to now to pass that off to Planning Commission to review and to look at to provide input on um and then you know if city council wants to move forward with what changes to the code we will do the eighth August 8th what time is that 6 15. that we have a meeting on the 22nd or not yes so we have the meeting on the um we may have two public hearings that right so if anybody's going to be gone let staff know so that we can plan all right uh Community comments Community comments are limited to those items on the agenda do we have anybody here this evening that wants to speak on community well actually the engineer probably doesn't want to speak all right then it's a hard pass all right moving on to public hearings uh the first one uh the public hearing on YMCA zone change and conditional use case File lu2023-009 ta is called order uh before I describe the procedures for conducting a public hearing I want to note that the applicant has requested a continuance of this hearing to August 22nd 2023. this is subject to the 120-day rule but since this is our first evidentiary hearing continuance we have not requested a waiver applying commission can grant requested continuance or conduct the hearing this evening as previously scheduled public testimony received thus far has been entered into the record and will be addressed as part of the public hearing on this application whether that hearing is conducted tonight or at a later date Steph is there anything further you would like to address regarding requested continuance yeah thanks chair Sims and so the continuance request is to continue working with ODOT be had a transportation memo written and they wanted revisions to it and so our transportation consultant is working on those Provisions just very generally the the zone change is related to this accompanying the sale of the properties the city selling the property to the YMCA and so we're doing the zone change before the sale and the cup so um I expect we'll bring this to you on the on the 22nd assuming we can get all the issues result with ODOT in the comments excellent and if it's not able we'll still we will still adjourn a meeting on August 22nd to either accept a continuance and notify the public of that continuance and then at that time we'll probably want to for the record get 120-day labor in there for the conditional use land use part of this application so we're in compliance yeah and the city's the applicants we can grant ourselves an extension and you can grant yourself yes but yes we need to do everything correctly so under the right procedures so uh yeah we can give ourselves 120 day extension but we need to open if we're not going to hold it open and then continue it again okay so uh are there any questions for staff or any issues Commissioners want to address related to the continuance uh procedural question when I make motion I'll need to add 120 day waiver or not next time all right I could entertain that motion now all right I'll move that the Sherwood Planning Commission continue the public hearing on the application for YMCA zone change additional use lu2023-009 PA until August 22nd 2023. is there a second I'll see any discussion on the motion all in favor of continuing the YMCA zone change and conditional use application lu20.309 PA until August 22nd say I I opposed motion carries thank you next is Theory number two the public hearing on the transportation system Plan update the case File lu2023012 is called to order the purpose of this hearing is to provide public with an opportunity to testify and provide information to the Planning Commission concerning the transportation system Plan update case File lu2023012pa the uh commission will conduct tonight's Hearing in the following order staff will present the staff report followed by questions if any by the funding commission for staff we will then open the hearing for public testimony and each person's time will be limited as followed the applicant will have 30 minutes put between presentation Revival in this case the this evening the city is the applicant then we'll have persons in favor of the application four minutes each person's opposed to the application four minutes each and then we'll have rebuttal of the applicant which will be the remainder of their 30 minutes we will then close the public hearing final comments by staff questions of Staff if any by the commission then discussion and deliberation by the a recommendation to city council may be made at the close of this hearing or the matter may be continued to a time and date certain if the matter is continues to a certain date this will be the only notice of that date you received staff did not receive any notifications 24 hours in advance from anyone wanting to provide testimony virtually if you wish to speak this this evening please fill out one of the blue testimony forms and submit it to planning staff the Planning Commission chair will recognize people who wish to speak and any questions should be addressed through the chair when you come to the microphone please ensure the light is green state your name and address for the record as this hearing will be recorded please speak clearly into the microphone and reaching a decision on the application the commission must consider whether the application meets the relevant approval criteria in the city's land use regulations those criteria are identified in the staff report the staff report is available online and at City Hall the staff report was accessible to the public seven days prior to this meeting day a testimony and evidence must address these criteria or other criteria you believe apply to the decision please note that failure to raise an issue with enough detail to enable the commission the applicant and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issues for close and appeal to the city council or land use sort of appeals on that also failure by the applicant to raise constitutional or other issues regarding proposed conditions of approval again with enough detail to allow the commission to respond to the issue for Clues and action for damages in Circuit this evening the funding commission will be making a recommendation to the city council the city council is the final decision Baker on legislative hearing a tentative city council public hearing on this battery is scheduled for August now I'll turn two staff to present the staff work reports thank you chair Simpson uh money Commissioners every religious community enrollment director of the city happened to be presenting to you guys for this tsp update um so first just uh clarification on the role planning commission's plan tonight this is a tsp update so um Your Role is to review the The Proposal which is adding the pet Bridge as a project and the tsp under the approval criteria for a plan of magnets and there's a Metro code and some Statewide planning goals that apply as um we're certainly happy to take feedback on the design really anything anything you have comments on we're happy to take that from you and sort of pass it up to city council um you're making a recommendation to city council tonight and so if you guys we can just package that even if it's not related to the approval criteria and whether or not the tsp should actually be updated which is your role if you guys just have other comments and then we're happy to take those and take them um so happy to hear anything but your role tonight is fairly limited to legislative tsp update that's what you're doing tonight so I haven't answered questions on on that um city of Sherwood is the applicant and again the proposal is to add the highway 99 pedestrian bridge to the to the tsp it's a type 5 legislative action um we sent uh notice to affected agencies on June 30th um we did get just one nice informal comment back from ODOT indicating that uh the city and our Consultants have been working really closely together with the ODOT technical design team So the plan reviewers at ODOT to navigate additional comment uh no comments from the state or Metro on um did public notice and provide an opportunity for",

from the chat if that's okay why don't you have the question from the chat and we have someone lined up to come uh right after that so go ahead and post it one second one person on the phone and then you're next sorry go ahead christine great so um it's a little long so here we go um i read a harvard belfor center analysis that said the national infrastructure will take 2.4 trillion dollars to upgrade we need 360 billion dollars by 2030 and we have less than 3 billion available for transmission loans now for the nation how is oregon going to pay for transmission upgrades also interstate transmission line upgrades take 15 years or more so how will oregon work with our neighboring states to deal with transmission upgrades and i just want to say before while jason thinks about that for a second um our job with this study is the department of energy is to challenges barriers also benefits right to floating offshore wind so this is definitely something we've looked into we might not have answers to these questions but just jason if there's anything you could add or say about that for chris harding on the line thanks for the great question um it definitely reinforces one of our key findings the the upfront cost of transmission is a key challenge i'm probably not prepared to give a detailed answer on all the costs it would be accomplished and who would ultimately pay for those generally speaking the transmission providers look at the economic viability of a and the interconnection costs um might be assigned to a developer or in different structures like a regional transmission organization um that's where that formalized cooperation takes shape and and they have complicated rate making formulas where cost allocation for um those new transmission lines get a proportion to the beneficiaries of them and so that's kind of just the high structural um overview of just what's involved with the transmission cost allocation um there has been some um three billion dollars uh allocated for transmission deployment across the nation um the magnitude of the numbers referenced in the question to highlight how kind of small that three billion dollars is in the grand scheme of things and also highlight how expensive transmission is so um hopefully that's somewhat helpful um that's great and i think one other thing there was a reference to a article from harvard and one of the things we're trying to do in this study is collect those references so if you're able to put the reference to that study in the chat my colleague christy can grab that and give it to jason uh go ahead sir well i know could you please say your name and either if you have the organization in malaysia that would be helpful i don't represent the when is it practical or needed for the support of our infrastructure you know as compared to this offsetting part in the environment is that the main purpose or do we actually have a demand for this yeah the demand is a little uncertain um there may be some amount of floating off for wind that that could be useful for our our oregon it's just marrying up the scale of offshore wind that would be viable for them to vomit um so it's it's a general um finding the gigawatts skills for current oregon utilities based on their current planning that they've done hasn't identified offshore wind in their portfolios however they they're continually updating their analysis for their in 2023 is the new year with with game plans that are going to be for the comics so um we leave it up to the utilities to kind of tell us and and their customers what's in their mix and what they might be targeting in the next five ten years thank you for the question kristen if you weren't able to hear it on the line the question you heard jason's answer was about the timing for the potential demand for this type of electricity and whether it's needed um for power demand reasons or policy reasons and jason walked through some of the planning processes that occurred with the utilities that's applied on electricity as well as some of the regulatory processes that might occur in the public utility commission our um boards that oversee on public utilities thank you for the question online and um here in first then uh christy are there any other questions or clarifying questions hope i don't see any hands raised and i don't see any other questions in the chat great i think we have a question in the thanks i'm heather mann i'm with the midwater scholars department hi jason nice to see you again um i have two questions on one of your slides you mentioned that offshore of oregon we had the potential for 62 gigawatts of energy and the three call areas that were announced initially were capable of 17 so it's 62 giga months basically the and then my second question is around how this study what's the nexus between this study and the bone process if there is water are you addressing that in your challenges component of the study because regardless of what comes out of the study woman is moving forward they have identified the three bigger ones but they've sent them done lying to scene people would like to see more so is that addressed because if i miss it i apologize but is there something in the study that talks about the fact that bomb is moving forward regardless of the study you're 100 correct in laying out the foundation of your question i wouldn't say there's a direct our study um maybe informing mobile's work i would say they're separate however they are in the same time and space that we're living in right now um representative brock smith kind of addressed it early at a high level um acknowledging that the bone processes have been kind of unfolding in different formats i'll say um from where i even asked almost 10 years um there was an unsolicited visa request early on and there wasn't a purchaser so that key piece that i've highlighted a couple times was missing we don't know if that may be missing again in this go around and so acknowledging that the bone processes are going um concurrently in this time and space we're living in right now um i think the thrust of the house bill and the direction to the department was inform the legislature with a landscape survey basically a field of what's the state of plan without floating offshore wind what are the benefits and challenges for actually integrating this into the grid and an off taker you know kind of a list of things i ran through um and so it's really to kind of get what's happening tonight happening right uh to kind of get the state looking in a little deeper than floating off the lid and kind of get a plan um get the natural resource agencies thinking about it even though um dlcd is the lead agency and coordinating with bones so they have been thinking about it as well and have developed a mapping tool which you'll hear about um so the planning has been already going on um it's just kind of the focus and increasing the depth of the state's planning and engagement and that's great i'll just add that as representative brock smith mentioned earlier that this is sort of the state listening on the barriers and challenges to the big picture of three gigawatts potential and i think that's informative for our common understanding of all of the various parts of this work and bone is certainly one part of that are there any other questions in the ring clarifying questions for the slime there's a couple people coming up and i don't see any questions from my colleagues on webex commission representing trial fishermen from oregon nutrition fishery west coast brownfish and pacific whiting my question is related to the economics and the disadvantages or challenges i should say uh slide one of them was mentioning the effects of the concerns uh from the loss of the areas to fishing there are more effects including the lost jobs and in the context of the local benefit or economic impact from the renewable energy that's question number one and the second question in also the challenges i believe the graph was related to high costs the costs down the stream to the we understand that annual national renewable energy laboratory uh has their studies showing that the central decrease in offshore wind energy costs but the media says otherwise from the east coast and europe and whether that is considered and also it is my understanding that when the energy um either overproduced the rainpayer or taxpayer has to pick up the bill when it's idle when the wind does not blow someone also has to pick up the is that considered thank you so a couple links to that question i think the first was um maybe the local comprehensive impacts the local economy outside of great prices and studying peace was more looking at right there in that um i can speak on behalf of what i know with what's kind of been raised in bones and i know that um lack of knowledge about what the potential effects could be with economic losses with getting bigger or shipping or other local economies is an open question at this point um the benefits that i've highlighted and that have been raised in comments related to officer when potential floating officer with development um are kind of only looking at one side of the ledger and and those would be benefits that are just directly or indirectly tied to floating offshoring and so the need for kind of a more comprehensive economic analysis that look at both positive impacts and the potential of adverse impacts is work that needs to be done and that would be an example of future study and engagement that would i would expect to show up in our final report um your second question was ratepayer impact and then um i won't be able to answer all the nuances or details i think that maybe we're connecting to that question um but at the highest level who purchases the power is again not only a key challenge in finding that person but that is where the ratepayer impact would would be so whoever that utility is um for example and utilities have rent mayors and other payers um shoulder those costs for the whole generation mix that certainly with their use of their um so if your local power providers here on the coast weren't purchasing that power and it was flowing to the grid and transferred to another utility it'd be",

        "text": " draft um because because it's it's a draft until we finalize a contract so it's a well I understand it's just good information that if we could direct them to to have something like that and we have that information on the website it's not the actual contract but okay the those like you know the the um requirements of the vendor are included on the website chair Huntington I have a question for you Marnie I think as of now I'm not sure if somebody correct me if I'm wrong the residents submitted a lot of questions that they were looking for answers and I don't think of that I think people appreciate the transparency in your process like this is where it's gonna hopefully be used these Palace shelters so I don't think transparency is the problem here I do think that residents are asking for some questions to be answered and they're not getting some of those answers and then they're painting a scary picture for themselves which isn't you know fear is a real thing what is the next meeting scheduled I'm not done asking my question uh chair Huntington if you don't but it speaks to when they're going to get answers staff has an answer to that the next okay Loa are you basically the residents submitted questions that were over 30 questions they haven't received any answers to any of those questions some of them are on the answer I found them some of the FAQ that was published but not all of them well I I'm not ex so the next meeting the next public meeting in Aloha I believe is June 26th they will get to answer them yes yes and and see step and the way the staff has set that up is that they were planning on having stations per category of questions so yes there is a concrete plan in place for people to interact with people to get answers to their questions if however people get as abusive as their emails are we're going to have to help people step aside and I guess I would add that you know we've had several meetings with the community in Aloha and um answered questions and every written um letter that we get we do respond to um I'm not sure if people are feeling that we're not answering the questions that we should probably have a conversation I think sometimes we're not giving the answers the answer they want but that's right I'm not I we can have a conversation about what you think is not being answered I I think it just just to be fair um to the constituents out there I think they submitted list of questions and I think they're expecting the list of questions because we might be I live in a congregated neighborhood but if my neighborhood is emailing you and you're answering to them it doesn't mean that I see that uh yeah so and I think people are just rattled and scared of fear that should not be there and it isn't real this isn't like in the movies and I think that's the story I hear um so and I'm trying to figure out how to curb but then people are firing back well listen Washington County haven't even answered my questions where are the 34 questions that are we submitted where are the answers and I'm saying well the FAQ some of them are answered in the FAQs but but then people are just have you seen a list of 34 questions I I have not I have not either okay we'll submit it to that you uh because I've seen it and I remember maybe and I said I said 34 it might be 30 or 35 but there are questions that were submitted so none of us are wearing lists of um and we do have the the events at for June 26th and I'm sorry I don't remember the exact time but we can have that all right one more question if I might I'm unclear on the purchase because you try to burn some bulk so you can have enough for various sites does this order cover both the sites we're looking at or just one so it's it's my understanding um we're moving um some of the folks that are at the um current Hillsboro temporary shelter to this site because the the Hillsborough shelter is ready for construction towards their ultimate goal of a year-round shelter um and I'm not um we haven't finalized the plan for Cornelius but it's a these are these are temporary shelters for no more than two years okay that's not answering the question I believe this order is for 60 palletized shelters yes okay are all 60 going to Aloha Methodist Church site or they're being spread across multiple sites is the basic question he's asking and looking for a clear answer and it's okay if you don't know exactly how many shelter sites or what the specific shelter sites are but we want a clear uh thank you chair for the record my name is Jess Larson I'm your assistant director in the Department of Housing Services uh we are purchasing 60 pods which would bring the total capacity of pods in the county to 90 with the intention to have three locations in operation across the county at three locations in operation across the county at all times until we have the permanent shelter capacity online which is in roughly 25 26 depending on how construction goes um and so only the the current location sorry there is only one location currently identified for 30 of the pods that are being requested to be purchased there uh we're continuing to look at other possible sites the other 30 pods that we currently have at the site in Hillsboro will be moving to the new site in in Cornelius there is a possibility that the city of Hillsborough is interested in again providing a pod shelter program at that location after they demolish the building and prepare the site because there's further delay on their permanent shelter which would allow us to use the other 30 shelter shelter pods that are part of this purchase at that location but it's generally a constant moving of opportunities and need across the county as a temporary solution until we have the permanent capacity so we don't need to be specific about where all 60 are we do need to be clear and specific that this is an order for 60 pods and that we continue to have a program working for multiple sites what I like about your and that gets back to I think with Pam and I'm picking on her because that I think your question was a great one the other year we're buying in bulk so that we have them for availability and I if I were resident active you can put 60 right on my site you didn't say that this is the order and so that makes sense to me thanks I've seen information that says all along with the Aloha Methodist Church that you were targeting 30 shelters yeah they're so yeah I think friends buying six different numbers no we need to be clear and specific about what our program is I agree and tell them and keep telling them over and over and over again so are there any other questions on today's business agenda terrific we will come back to leadership communication when we reconvene the work session uh after our business leader thank you",

        "text": " it is quite quite a sight to see you can see as you navigate around there you've got the the 90 degre sweeps that are going under the dryve apron to the charging pad hole and then the stub UPS where the cabinets will go so what's next um so we'll finish uh construction at Kaiser Transit Center should be uh done in December of this year we are approximately and I don't want to uh say it too loudly but we're about a week and a half in some change ahead of schedule at um Kaiser so the one that I the picture I showed you with the pad in the ground um that was that picture is two weeks old and right now all three locations are backfilled and ready for concrete we were uh scheduled to set the last pad on October 12th we're ahead of schedule so that's that's great news So the plan was to energize um energize ktc the week of December 18th so um right now with with our schedule and UL testing and certification and um signing off uh we have to make sure that we're not too too far ahead of schedule otherwise we'll get to turn the power on but can't do anything because they're not inspected so um right now that is set for that week uh in December uh so construction at Dell web uh if notice that's capitalized so if construction begins on 101 it will be 24 weeks uh to complete so that would put us um end of March mid April to be done and able to charge at Dell web uh and then that would put us at Revenue Service at the May service change uh that's kind of the official big push but as as we get Chargers online and we're able to use them uh we can roll buses out into Service as we as we get them so there's a picture of Dell web and I was going to be real clever and say that's the before picture and the after picture because nothing's nothing's occurred there um but I did want to show you kind of the you know I I recall bringing a couple of times um information to the board about a land use issue that we're working through uh with the City of Salem um so just to give you an idea of this is the picture of Dell web uh in the daytime where you see um the bus wash and the fuel Island so lower uh lower middle part of the screen ah thank you my pointer doesn't worked there yes so that will become Electric Avenue where you see uh those seven buses those will all be energized and uh have dispensers on them uh and power running to them so what we're working through is um the land use issue on the property just north of our of of the Del Web operations headquarters uh and then where you see what um it is not a regional airport it may look like that but so there's uh the the soil disturbance um that will happen is in that little kind of Runway setup looking setup uh so trenching will go east to west all along Electric Avenue uh and then the uh line boring from Salem electric from the Transformer from the southeast Southwest to the north Northeast um where Salem electric will tie it into a closed loop to the substation which is also owned by Salem electric uh which is just out of the frame of the picture and completing the loop so that uh if we had if we lost power on the south side of the property where the power enters the property um we could then flip a switch we being Salem electric then we would get power from the substation so still be able to charge uh and then we're working on uh the backup generation and what that's going to look like for the CG stations as well as the BBS so remaining steps uh as I I've kind of already alluded to uh the uh ktc con uh construction will be complete and then energize the infrastructure uh Del Web will have that construction begin um hopefully uh this this coming next month um what we've got is um the technicians are currently being trained by by um gillig staff but we have more training coming a lot more training coming um operator instructor training should be um starting uh at towards the middle of next month and then of course operator training as we get closer to being able to charge so we do have a portable charger uh that we got we can charge one bus in a day uh it's it's a little charger compared to what um what the dispenser and the power blocks will do um but uh maintenance has come up with a plan that uh starting Friday they can charge a bus and they'll have four buses ready to roll on Monday for operator training because it will take um a significant amount of energy to go through an operator uh the so uh the operator training will get uh closer probably in January we'll we'll start that in Earnest um because we'll have a service change and then we'll have another service change so we're going to start with the Route 11 operators and then all of the extra board um vacation relief and regular relief drivers uh and then once those are done then we'll train the rest of the roster so we'll have 100% of the roster trained on BBS um and it is a it it this training is very serious um these buses do not behave like a CG or a diesel bus um it's it's real-time power um just like if you have an EV car and you put your foot to the floor it goes um I the one of the team that was down at the at the um at that bus right there said that they showed him what it could do and it chirped the tires on a 40ft bus when he when he um hit the accelerator um which was both amazing and terrifying all at the same time so um but for the record um the gillig staff has detuned um everything three times now to get it down manageable so that we're not um running into even accidental um uh challenges in the aisle if if we if we um break too hard or or um accelerate too hard but I digress so we have emergency response training and uh my colleague um mentioned that so we're going to be having uh first responder training for both e uh you know law enforcement um for other issues but for fire uh response uh on a battery electric bus it is different so we'll be um collaborating on that um data collection training so that's route validation the seeing if the modeling works um how close to the D name plate range are we going to be uh versus um what we you know what we actually have so we're going to be doing a whole range of tests from uh dead weight ballast testing to uh we want to run the bus on the route stopping starting kneeling raising merging traffic picking up people dropping people off uh and see how it how it goes um that's real life testing and that I think will get us kind of real real information and then pull that from the from the computer that's on board the system so we have um real uh real data that we'll be able to collect um and then uh project closeout which I cannot wait to get to that stage I've never looked more forward to doing weekly and monthly quarterly reports but that means we're actually rolling these buses and I honestly I just can't wait to get these buses on the street that um that patent scheme is amazing when it's going down the road it it just looks it looks like it's electric so uh this one uh before I get to the questions part that's so trust but verify there are the 10 buses in a line uh patiently waiting to uh serve the Salem area uh and then the rounde 11 will get a little bit of a a extra jewelry I guess um so each bus stop will replace the blue standard international this is a bus stop sign with a zero missions Corridor bus stop topper uh so and with that that concludes the the update I'm happy to answer any questions thank you Chief Operating Officer Deets any questions for him let me rephrase that who would like to go first director Carney all right um well that that was a wild rbe presentation I was I was excited I was happy there were times I was mildly terrified um and also the the distribution blocks look a lot like a dehumidifier that I have in my basement so you might you just double check that when they get here um so my question and maybe you guys all have this covered but growing up my dad taught me that a lot of stuff is cool to DIY but hire an electrician so I have a healthy fear of electricity and this picture of all these big wires in the ground um gave me some concerns do we have as a district the ability to kind of like de energize things in a hurry should we ever have need to so thank you for the question director Carney um yes and no so we will have emergency shut offs at the cabinet which will be uh immediately kind of adjacent the bus stops at each one of the um uh base at Kaiser but if it was a a catastrophic sort of failure that would be a Salem electric shut down um the whole Transformer would have to be shut down um there are certain fail safes uh already in the equipment um but if it were something large scale we we'd involve the professionals we'd call um uh PGE sorry um who could de energize super okay that um that answers that I'm still scared of electricity um I also I want to say these zero missions bus Toppers on the what are we calling it which quarter the green quarter electric quarter electric bu quar I love them I can't wait to go right yeah thank you have to give shout out to the marketing team uh Jonah Hansen's design director hrom thank you so I think my my main burning question is when does the board get to ride uh one of these things or drive or drive I've heard the tires chirp not anymore thank uh so we could certainly arrange any time that that uh any member of the board would like to come out um I know we had a bunch of curious operators just this afternoon that said can have the keys to the car and um they did get to go for a a spin in the bus uh on property so anytime very exciting so uh excited also that we're going to get um apparently some inductive charging for Christmas that's good um so the the Del charging says if it starts by this Sunday how how certain is that do you think",

has been very valuable for us and we very much appreciate it I very much appreciate um all of that so so Wally but you you are definitely leaving us in a much better position um than when you got here so again thank you very much and I am definitely going to miss you and I know the rest of the staff will and I anticipate the rest of the council will as well so again thank you for everything I'll speak real quick to that too uh Wally uh or Mr Adams we have really enjoyed uh working with you and like I'll Echo everything Todd said and uh have a fantastic retirement all right I'm gonna move on to project updates uh we got a couple of notices of intent submitted since the last council meeting the first is the yellow rose bush Energy Center so we received the notice of intent on September 1st and uh the applicant is the yellow rose bush Energy Center LLC they are a wholly owned subsidiary of Savion LLC the facility is a proposed solar PV energy generation facility with a capacity of 800 megawatts and related in sporting facilities in both Wasco and Sherman County the notice of intent is under review by the department currently it is available on the project we've established a project web page and it's on there and then we anticipate issuing a public notice in early October and then we will be holding a public information meeting in mop-in sometime in October that has not been figured out yet but it would be sometime in probably the latter part of October next we have the Umatilla Morrow County connect project so we received that notice of intent on September 13th the applicant is Umatilla Electric Cooperative the project is a 14 mile 230 KV transmission line with portions of the facility located in both Morrow and Umatilla counties the department is working with the applicant to resolve some property owner information we always have to make sure that we have the correct property owner notice information and so we're just having some questions about that but a project page has already been established and the notice of intent is on there on the web page not yet okay sorry my um we've yet to established that but we will uh likely very soon so unless there's any questions on that I'll move on a few compliance updates so yes if you can move the slide forward please so we have some updates on the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility one this is a Portland General Electric facility um so some findings associated with that are that can uh condition related it's the condition p r e l u03 we always have very uh complicated condition numbering system but they relate to whether it's you know temporarily pre-construction condition or construction or operation so that's what the pr e and then the Lu would be related to land use and then it's just a consecutive numbering system but what we found is that there was a failure to treat and control noxious weeds in accordance with plan requirements so we're following up with that on a general condition related to Public Services there was a failure to maintain locked turbine doors at all times when not being inspected and then a condition related to construction on public services inadequate gravel base at one of the turbine pads so we're following up on all of those then uh another update Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility two this is a nextera similar we have an issue related to failure to treat and control noxious weeds that we were following up on another one related to the inadequate gravel base around so if you think about it you know you have a turbine pad and typically it's in the midst of wheat fields at least in the Mid-Columbia area and it's important to maintain that gravel base to ensure you know protection of the adjacent Farm Fields that's why we're looking at that one and then another one related to failure to provide adequate documentation of the turbine blade tower inspection and monitoring plan as required by condition so again we are following up on all of these but these are just findings based upon you know our review of these okay next is we have provided new computers to most council members most of you have received those not everybody but most of you have received those and most of you have had login issues so sorry about that we do have Michael gallante who is from RIT Department he is here today so at the end of this meeting for the council members who are in person who have new computers and are still having issues please stick around we'll bring Michael in and he can walk you through getting that logged in for those of you who have received new computers and aren't here in person My Hope Is that we will get that figured out using the import in-person portion today and then he can then help everybody out remotely in the coming weeks then last on my list is the next regularly scheduled council meeting is October 19th and 20th that's a Thursday and Friday we have one potential agenda item for that meeting and that is the last agenda item today is the radioactive waste materials rulemaking part of that will be we're requesting the council give us direction to file the notice of proposed rulemaking with the Secretary of State part of that requirement and this will um so we'll go through this more later on but part of that is we have to set a date time and location of a public hearing while those rulemaking hearings aren't required to be in front of council we think there's a lot of value and having most rulemaking hearings in front of council there's a lot of interest in this rulemaking and so we we think that should be the case so um you'll need to be thinking about when you want to have that rule-making um since we don't have any other agenda items that could be a good opportunity either on the 19th or the 20th time is not really a you know we don't have to have it at any particular time you need to set that but it doesn't have to be at 8 30 or 5 o'clock you can set it whenever you want so just be thinking about whether the 19th or the 20th are good options if you have preferences on either one of those dates or another date and then what time so I will leave it at that but just wanted to tee that up because we'll bring it up later on and I wanted to make sure that you had a chance to think about that that concludes my report unless any council members have any questions or counselor Condon thank you um Vice chair how um hey quick question related to some earlier conversations we had with respect to the standards the different standards and our review of them and on the organizational expertise standard we had a first pass at it and I'm just wondering if there's a possibility to schedule a second pass um to get a little bit deeper into the that standard and how applicants are reviewed just yes um thank you councilmember Condon the short",

        "text": " so those are all those items that i listed or are inputs into their modeling and they used um oh it's an emf workstation uh but it's it's a model developed by the electric power research institute which also uses a methodology developed by the bpa to calculate these electric fields which are measured in the kilovolts per meter one of the items that they include in the modeling as a minimum ground as well so and then there's uh similar with a lot of council standards we're looking at like um worst case scenarios right so there's scenarios that transmission lines can operate in of like you know even if it's a 500 kv transmission line um they could you know like you could put 550 kb through there um that's not a normal operating situation but then do you say we do that with during our hot summer months and you could actually have some impacts with that transmission line where there is transmission like sag um and so so these are kind of contemplated in the so the table here is a little bit small but we'll go to that third column over and what do we see we see that that 500 kv transmission line if it's under nine but it is not under nine by very much right um now uh what our condition says is with this um signing standard for transmission line it's condition one we have these minimum ground clearances right so this is like you can't it cannot sag any further because then that impacts that level at one meter above um but we also added in under any conditions right so we have to ensure and make sure that those are operated even under those worst case like high voltage hot sunny weather where you potentially may have sag that that those still have to be those ground clearances have to be maintained and so let's see um and i noted on this earlier under the organizational expertise so um we have siding standard for transmission lines condition two um and this is this is more associated with the second part of the standard and it's um i believe it's a mandatory condition and this is the providing landowner maps and basically taking steps to reduce induced nuisance shocks like grounding um grant and transmission lines and equipment working with landowners where that may be an issue and then we have the citing standards for condition three which is a site-specific condition and this is the one that says that the facility shall be designed constructed constructed and operated according to the most recent version of the nesc yes oh okay we're here any changes feel or warranted yes we rendered stronghold and out hanley jenkins yes sydney cotton yes vampire yes thank you very much all right i know we're smooth sailing this one's going to be this is a little this is a heavy this is a heavy um section in the proposed order but it's really interesting so i'm going to do my best to describe it um so okay so go we're gonna go back to the general standard of review and what is what do we have to look at we're looking at council standards but then we're also looking at the other applicable laws and statutes of oregon right and so um for an energy facility that may need a removal fill permit um that a state permit that would fall under the jurisdiction of council that council's decision so this is really exciting council actually just gets gets to include and make a decision and again today's not decision day but we're looking at it um about a renewable filterman um underneath your jurisdiction um and that so that is interesting so uh removal fill law has its statutes and then its administrative rules that are administered by the oregon department of state lands for dsl dsl is the expert um on wetlands and waters of the state and oregon and they're you know there they are also the ones that would issue a a removable fill permit as necessary the threshold to keep in mind for removal fill permits in oregon is if there's 50 cubic yards that we're taking out of a wetland or a waterway or that we're putting it even even temporary um so oh okay so now i'm going to go to my site so okay also going back to the proposed order and that front end where we talked about um site access item the the applicant did have access to a lot of the transmission line site boundary however um they did not get site access to the entire um site boundary to do all of the necessary on-site surveys the wetland delineations and wetland surveys are one of those however for the vast majority that they did access they provided that to dsl in september of 2018 dsl issued we called a letter of concurrence they call the letter currents um and it is dsl saying hey we looked at your wetland delineations they're technically accurate we agree with what you said and those resulted in 40 the identification of 45 wetlands 54 waterways and five points in the analysis area so then and i have it here and i uh i have it here is removable fill condition one so this is um when the applicant does get access to the remaining parcels we have a condition that says send that information to dsl and we want a conference letter so that's what condition one says so let's move move on so now we know how many wetlands and waters our waterways are uh here so based on that then the applicant looks at and says okay well we'll try to put our facility to avoid some of those but we looked at it and we're estimating um that there's going to be 0.793 just under 0.8 acres of temporary and permanent impacts to waters um waters of the state and wetlands now it's like you're like less than one acre that's not too much but that still is more than that 15 cubic yards so that is why we need a removable the department worked really close with dsl right because this is one of those situations where we get to work with them and they're used to issuing permits we say well it's underneath the council's jurisdiction and we're going to work together and so we're working together and um and uh it's cool and it's interesting and we have a draft of the permit and it's attached to the proposed order and it went out for comment we're talking about it today because nobody really um nobody comments on it so but this is all still right like this is all still preliminary because we still need to finalize it once we get all of those additional surveys and get them to dsl they agree that we're going to re-run our final impact counts and update that in our final kind of impact to wetlands assessment um and we have conditions that contemplate and require that entire process um so but because there are impacts dsl does require that they're um uh and i've talked about some of this on here oh um okay i'll get to that i'm gonna stop here so it's interesting because if you're looking at the proposed burden like my goodness the removal pill section is really long um in dsl's rules and it's part of working with dsl and um it's that under dsl's rules if there is removal or fill activities that need a permit that are greater than two acres of dsl or the rules basically require that there be these determinations and considerations done and written findings and when we're like but we're 0.8 that's still less than two acres we don't have to do that right and dsl didn't do it but and the applicant actually provided it in their exhibit j and we thought that it best just to go ahead and and do those written determinations and evaluations and in that section there are recommendations also word because right dsl's not doing those we're asking council to do those so um you know we do make recommendations that these bulleted items have been demonstrated um not only in the information about wetlands but we pull from information from the other sections in the proposed order and in the application so um that is i thought it would be fine sorry my oh died goodness sorry guys yeah yeah yeah yeah that would be good i don't know sorry folks while we're waiting for that to come up i thought this could be kind of a good status check in terms of preparing for august you know it's this sort of format work so if kellen will be doing the same thing for all the other standards you know at least the portions that are not related to contest the case and and jesse will be doing something similar it'll be slightly different because it'll be related to the exceptions and then but it'll generally follow the same kind of process so just you know make sure that this works or if you have any other ideas about you know a different type of presentation and that might be better for you so just looking for everyone i think it works great it's a little bit yeah i think it's good to walk through but i do have a question would it is it maybe it's my process but would it is it better considered better like if i had a question about you know a standard that kellen or the presenter doesn't present to call and maybe it gets added for discussion so it's not an interruption but you know that'd be better well we appreciate that just to be able to prepare for it so we you know can have a response for you but again i want to make sure that it sort of distinguishes if it if it are if it is unrelated to the contested case so right then that should go to kellen if it's related to the contested case it should go to jesse with that caveat absolutely please you know not to say you have to uh it's our you know our job to be responsive to you but you know the more heads up we can get to better prepare that would be appreciated yeah yeah yeah i wouldn't do that contestant case but it strikes me just by me which that actually reminds me of the going back to uh organizational and it doesn't impact the straw poll or anything right but what's the other part of that is restoring the site to a useful non-hazardous condition and where do we usually reroute that to we usually reroute that to the retirement financial assurance standard and we kind of rely on that evaluation in those conditions and there are um uh contested case issues associated with the retirement financial assurance standard so that's why it's just like selectively omitted but i'm just like telling you now so you know we're kind of going to wait so that's one of those things of like again the preponderance of evidence when we get down the road we're looking at",

        "text": " get ideas ahead of the legislative and this is an idea that came from um Lake County resources and uh Institute right that's not right initiative wherever the eye is um but they um they suggested that we have somebody whose job it is to just help communities apply for energy funds so you can see that that role would also be another one that could give us capacity to do that so we're definitely working on having that capacity the other piece is something that folks might remember me pitching you on a while ago and um we again were planning on doing it when we have ideally some um in the new year when we can't open up round three but are kind of waiting uh for round three to open and so the idea that we had and I'd be curious if folks think it's a good idea um I'd also be curious well I'll pitch I'll ask my second question after I say the idea um the idea was to have community-based organizations in a given Community kind of organize those meetings use their existing relationships because we don't know exactly who to get to show up at these conversations and they see an email from Christy split you know who knows who cares right but if they see an email from somebody they know really well they're more likely to show up of course and so we had talked before about doing like stipends for organization or like contracts grants to organizations that would be willing to kind of host these types of meetings exactly what Phil's talking about or commissioner Chang sorry just seeing your name is spelled but um but um but exactly that point of like um but having the right people host it right and but us compensating them because community-based organizations are so busy and stretched then so just curious if folks think that's a good idea and then if they think it's a good idea or not like what kind of money you think a community-based organization like how much resource would they need to do that kind of work so that we can kind of work with our Contracting and procurement type teams at our agency to see if it's possible for us to do seems like a good idea most communities especially rural communities are under that don't have enough capacity uh typically to to be working on this in the first place so yeah I think it would depend on what kind of capacity the organization that you're working with already has are they hiring somebody to do this or do they have somebody on staff that has capacity to to take that on so I I don't know what an appropriate number would be but I do think it's a good idea me too yeah and and uh I would also throw out I don't know if this has been uh talked about before but I don't know how much uh coordination you did with energy trust or vulnerable environmental Foundation who are already working with communities and providing capacity in the energy space um because it seems like there's a Synergy there I know Energy Trust and bf have both been kind of pipelines of renewable sound really for a few years so um that seems like low-hanging fruit that could could have built both organizations that's great and we have Jenny Hall's kind of an ex-officio member of this advisory committee is on the line but you're right we we've talked to be off a little bit but that's a really good idea I think that's a great idea I don't have any resolution to offer in terms of what the funding requirement would be and I I also encourage you um you will be successful in hiring someone awesome I know it we'll just send you that that Vision but also encourage you to kind of inventory where people already meet there are so many meetings and everyone's scrambling if there are standing City Council meetings those tend to get kind of a broad swath of folks that are movers and shakers at the community level and maybe it's not as comprehensive as your traditional webinars but at least to make that intro and give them like an A La Carte overview of all of the things that they can follow up on one of the other benefits of doing these localized workshops would be media and I'm not sure how much media coverage see rep got in this last solicitation cycle but um you know you have a local group hosting a workshop bringing people from the Oregon Department of energy you know like and and you're right it's better to um local people who have some kind of connection to the to the topic do the invites but then you all have to come to you know deliver you know expert information and details about the um but that is that that seems like the kind of thing that would get news stories and then those news stories translate into you know 100 people in your community calling the school district and say hey did you hear about this thing and I got this idea and and uh that's how you get some of the the magic to happen I agree with everything that's been sentences Audrey from um Fiji Portland General Electric and yeah I think there was some inertia to um to help talk about it get excited about it the people are stretched then even at like municipalities and organizations of more resources than some of the modern prophets are saying you know that's a great idea PGE we don't have the time we don't have the bandwidth to do that sorry we're gonna um when we're trying to partner with some of these eligible entities and um it's it really is a lot of work for them to do and put together to be able to put together the resources to apply for this and then like best less worst case scenario they get the Grant and then they actually have to do it and implement the project it's um a lot so I think that um you know interveneer funding and stakeholder funding is something that's pretty um you know typical and then a lot with the the utilities so I don't know if that's um public with like the a PC of what the going rate is for that interviewer funding but um it definitely seems like something that is pretty standard practice with a lot of these with a lot of those um community-based organizations and other stakeholders and do you think that that another option based on that everyone's bandwidth is you know is low um and timeline even second round moving into third round maybe a way to be able to solicit some of that interest or uh or be able to drive those types of efforts on the local level um to not necessarily send out canned webinars recorded webinars of the program but try maybe uh intern in the program we can create sort of our uh you know video info sheet for the program somewhere in a uh you know a two to three minute synopsis that can then be shared out to you guys that can be shared out to stakeholders that can be shared out to community groups uh something that uh might uh both inform but could even drive additional interest in wanting to have us come out and do local presentations or uh or or online presentations live anything anything to that effect I think that's a good idea it's easy to share and I'm I'm just fast forwarding to the point where um we're able to talk more with higher resolution about some of the successful projects at least the successfully funded projects that you could kind of highlight This Is How They approach Community engagement this is not like there are some new components to this that some of the eligible entities are kind of stacking their heads going how do we do this so maybe to be able to do kind of like a highlights like best practices to to share in those more newly emergent aspects of this funding program yeah or even like a template or something that's kind of replicable like here's what a microgrid is here are the um the things that are conserve here's about how much it costs here's what it takes the generation the storage the controls and sort of like because a lot of this is not um like I did this 40 hours a week but not everybody else does and so if you are a small community based organization can they really benefit from the but you're not a utility professional or an engineer or somebody who's really well versed in this you might not even know where to start and to how to um well I'd love to have resilience but what does that mean for us and so if we could kind of like um you know have like templated examples perhaps to help people get started um you know t-shirt sizing small medium large and these are the various pieces of it for what you're trying to achieve um I just don't know if that could help kind of um get people over the initial problem of where it's very you know it's a lot it's big it's intimidating it's a lot of money and so sort of like really helping to just um take down the intimidation and some of the barriers of the first place to get started excellent thank you I do want to uh we're coming up on about about 3 47 or so um and uh do you want to be mindful of leaving some time for the public comment as well but I also don't want to cut off this uh conversation so first I was going to ask that anybody on that subject matter did anybody have anything else before we move on to a second yes sir one one additional thought I mean in the um in the showcasing of the grantees who from first cycle you could be also be kind of seeding information in communities about the program so you do stuff to get a big splash at the community level in a bunch of places around the state for the projects that were already funded um and then you you make sure that as part of the package of information you cast the net for that the next projects and and you know be very mindful that you know we're looking for more projects they don't have to be exactly like this one but this is what you know this is what the program is looking for um and uh yeah yeah when when you pour money into some place people pay attention so it's an opportunity to to you know to capitalize on that attention to to um get other people interested excellent thank you well I am uh with a just to make sure that we maintain a little bit of time um uh one of the other uh points we wanted to raise for this is we're moving into round two is uh obviously we're going to be opening up the uh the ex the uh external evaluating uh excuse me the external review uh questionnaire portal to have new reviewers come in and we wanted to take a moment and ask the committee if you had any recommendations uh for uh reviewers for round two and and this could also be something",

somebody created with that machine uh the scale uh which I mean that was a great visual for me to see the scale of U materials that you can produce there fascinating uh and and also I've asked Cascade High School to bring out their kiddos on a tour specifically um to your property because I think there's a lot of opportunity those kids are interested in a variety of the different positions that you all host so perfect I'll figure out how to do that coordinate that maybe through S core to get them on a field trip we'd love to have them great thank you thank you okay so you're going to stay right

said core of the mid Willam Valley quarter report and Kelly do you want to kick it off yeah I'll jump so as you mentioned this morning we're hosting the Strategic Economic Development Corporation more commonly known as SED cor to provide their quarterly report as you know Maran County works with s core for business retention oh mind did you introduce yourself for the oh I did not sorry it's okay I'm Kelly whis I'm the economic development program manager and thank you yes I'm just rocking um anyway Maring County works with sore on business retention and expansion um there are fabulous

had quite a bit of activity it's it's um always nice to hear to see um continued interest in investment in in the region and um uh we've talked to you in the past about the robots that are coming but the got to finally tour agility robotics facility they still don't um aren't quite in place yet um but they're doing the the leasehold improvements um look forward to hosting a a tour with the commission and other folks in the future there they're very um anxious to show off what they're what they're doing I will go commissioner bethl may not I mean I I was just going to say I'll go except for I request the sheriff's participation I have seen I Robot and the humans win in the end that's right as long as you have props and GS I'm all for that but we're working with them now on their um uh Enterprise Zone so you know they are going to be eligible for the Enterprise Zone I'm working with the um assessor's office on that same for jensco another company that's going in um manufacturer of HVAC equipment um we've got their paperwork just went in yesterday I think with the assessor's office um in the food processing uh industry we're really happy to see uh some a couple businesses that we've been talking to now about planned expansions investment and Facilities um uh can't give too much away at this point but the role that we generally play is to um listen what the plans are bring in Partners to the table to identify who can do what pieces of the of the puzzle um as far as incentives Workforce training um and uh I think we're going to have a couple really good projects to be reporting on in the future that that are currently on our docket um we just had GK here maybe Kip wants to talk a little bit about uh the work with GK but we're very fortunate to have Connie and Gary give us a tour as well um it was and it was Kip's first time in there so I know he was looking at the Machinery the same way you were CH bethl it's pretty amazing uh thank you for having me kit Morris was sore um yeah so recently I've been privileged to be able to work with uh GK um some of the things that Connie mentioned with uh bringing on some Workforce Development we're doing a really good job uh recently with Future Ready Oregon dollars to help support uh entry-level positions so companies are now becoming inundated with entry level what they're looking for is to scale up from within so apprenticeship is a really good model for them to use they're already kind of aligned with an apprenticeship model they have a earn while you learn model in place they just haven't aligned with bully yet um so there's some opportunity there to help some establish their Workforce and support it with apprenticeship with internship and then also with pre-apprenticeship so happy to be doing that work with them and and we're seeing the workforce questions coming up a lot with our existing employers they're wanting to invest in both lean manufacturing type um skills as well as bringing on new equipment which results in Need for new skills for their existing workers so that incumbent worker training is really important um and I think what we we've been trying to promote that through our involvement with the Future Ready Oregon manufacturing Consortium and that's working its way through the HEC board but we hope to see some language in there that we can hopefully take advantage of in the future on behalf of our manufacturers in the region uh we're also I've mentioned this before it looks like it's finally coming together this next quarter um working with shm Community College and the City of Woodburn on a warehouse and distribution um training module for for businesses um now we'll start with a round table discussion with the employers that we have in the region it's a significant industry here and as evidenced by agility robotics um an industry that is looking at you know more automated automation I mean they're pretty automated now but to see the next level of automation going in such as robotics um it's not just uh the typical warehouse and distribution training anymore you know um forklift trading and that sort of thing it's actually much more involved in in uh Robotics and um I think Shema is really up for packaging that in a new way for those types of businesses around the Innovation and Entrepreneurship work I've talked to before about our Latino micro Enterprise development program we've just started our fourth fourth cohort of that the first three were here in Salem the fourth is with a partner out of McMinville um and then we'll be doing another one here in Salem coming up um probably in the summer um we've been averaging 30 to 50 people in the in the cohorts which is a mix of existing businesses and entrepreneurs that are looking to take that next step but it's um um really been one of the places that we've seen the most um um kind of the feedback that we get from the folks that are taking that the courses and getting those skills and really working with each other the mentorship and and the leaning on each other I think it's really a a nice benefit for um us to be able to provide that venue for them can you just tell us what the skills is that they're acquiring oh it's everything from um kind of basic business um you know how to do a business plan um to how to hire people how to deal with insurance um talking to a banker you know um we've also added on a couple things around tax forms because we found that this is attached to a a microloan program that we had um and um a lot of the time one of the requirements is show us your most recent tax form forms and if the business isn't up to speed on taxes um we've tried to bring in some of those resources sha actually had a program kind of on the shelf for that um so really it's it's working through a 12 10 to 12 week um class where each module is basically part of a business plan so at the end of it they will have a a full business plan and all the the marketing and finance and human resource and other things that would be included in that do they have to pay a fee to participate no how's it how do you fund it it is funded right now through the state's economic equity investment program EIP through business Oregon interesting okay and um we do understand that that funding they'd asked for funding in this next in the short session uh they'd asked for 30 million to continue that program I think they were awarded at the last minute 8 million um with no Staffing attached to it so in business organ trying to figure out how it's going to allocate that but we are hoping that uh that will allow us to continue you know on until the next um you know the next budget year are there other programs in our community that focus on other minority populations there's B black um program that's also been able to benefit from that same EIP program and uh um we",

        "text": "It. It. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County Board of County Commissioners Board meeting. Today is March 19, and if you'll please stand with me, I'll be offering the invocation as well as leading us in the pledge. Dear heavenly Father, thank you for this day and this wonderful opportunity to come together in unity for the good of our citizens in Marion county. May you impart wisdom and your blessings on all of our decisions as we do the business before us. Today I ask a special blessing on our protectors, both at home and abroad. I thank you, Lord, for the favorite, as we celebrate our county's 180th anniversary this month. For your glory, in the name of Jesus, I pray, amen. Amen. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. And I will now ask if we can have roll call by the clerk, please. Chairman Stone? Here. Vice chairman Bryant? Here. Commissioner Curry? Here. Commissioner McLean? Here. Commissioner Zalek. Commissioner Zalick is on site. I'm sure he'll be joining us momentarily. And here he comes now. Great. Thank you. That'll take us to our first item of proclamations and presentations. I can get a motion. Got a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by Commissioner Curry. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously, and we do have a proclamation if we can ask Amanda Tartt, our assistant county administrator, to come forward. Do you have something you'd like to present first? All right, well, then the commissioners will join the round front, and Commissioner Curry is going to be reading this proclamation because his forefathers were here at that time. So I thought they asked me to read this because I'm the oldest guy up here. Jimmy Callan, our property appraiser, says, I was born in 1823, so anyway, I guess I qualify. I am excited to present. The proclamation says, whereas the year of 2024 marks the 180th anniversary of the creation of Marion County, Florida, and wheReas, the us government acquired Florida in 1821 and in 1825 created an agency to oversee the Seminole population in what would become Marin County, Florida, establishing a military outpost for protection, obviously Fort King. And whereas, pioneers migrated to present day Marion county during the 1840s and due to the free land offered under the Armed Occupation act, and whereas, Gabriel Priest, the first state senator from Marion, played a pivotal role in advocating for the creation of Marion county through legislative action, and wheReas, the territorial legislative council authorized the formation of Marion county, and Richard Keith call the territorial governor signed the law on March 25, 1844. And whereas Marin county has grown substantially in its history and now boasts significant economic development and the title of horse capital of the world, now, therefore, the board of county Commissioners of Marin County, Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in us, do hereby proclaim Saturday, March 23, 2024, is Marin County Day. It's duly proclaimed this 19th day of March, 2024, signed by all five county commissioners and attested by the clerk of the court. So we do have such a great history here. You know, a lot of people don't realize that Silver Springs was our first tourist attraction back in the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds, going into the twenties, we would have upwards and exceeding a million visitors a year. So we stand on the shoulders of a lot of strong people that were our forefathers. So, commissioners, congratulations. We made it. We haven't messed it up too bad, and we'll keep trying to do a good job for the community. Thank you. Sure. So, just to let everybody know a little bit about what we have coming on Marion County Day. So Marion County Day is this Saturday here at the McPherson complex, and it will be from ten to two. We have over 150 vendors that are planning to be here, as well as all of our first responders throughout our community. All of our county departments will be showcased, and we have an awesome kids zone, too. So bring out the family, enjoy some food and some fun, and celebrate Marion county day with us. Thank you. Anybody else? I'm good. Thank you. Okay. I do hope many of you will come out and celebrate with us on Saturday, and we'll remind you all at the end of this meeting as well. Next on our agenda is public comment, and I do have one person that's not correct. I have no one who signed up for this particular portion of the meeting, which is if you have something you'd like to address the board on concerning what is on our agenda for today, and if you do, I ask you to come forward and give us that item number. That would be greatly appreciated. Is there anyone who has 1.2? Oh, 1.2. Excuse me, I'm just moving on past. My apologies, mister Johnson. If you will take us to 1.2, the unveiling of our second no horsing around anti littering campaign. Good morning, Mark Johnson, director of Solid Waste. I'm pleased to be here this morning for the unveiling of our second Suntran bus, which hits the streets of Marion county earlier this month. This bus is just one more part of our no horsin around campaign which was a direct result of the litter task force in collaboration with our local businesses agencies that have all come together to help us put together an action plan for no littering and Marion. This is our second bus in circulation and is made possible due to the collaborative partnership with the sheriff and the Crime Prevention Campaign, which reminds people that littering is a crime in Marion county. The goal of the campaign is to educate the public on the importance of keeping Marion beautiful while reminding them that littering is a crime. This bus, among other education activities in the public, brings awareness, brings awareness and gets people engaged for a better and more beautiful Marion. Before I go, I would like to encourage everyone to visit our website, marionfl.org nohorsing around to take the litter free pledge and learn more about business partnerships and what you can do to help keep Marion litter free. And don't forget, you can come see our new bus in person at Marion County Day this Saturday right here at the McPherson complex from 10:00 to 02:00 thank you very much. That is a lovely looking bus on both sides. I love it. We did not ask that it come this morning, but we do invite you all to come back on Saturday to see it up close and personal. And I thank you, Mister Johnson, for your presentation. Do you have something you'd like to. Yeah, I just wanted to add one thing. The program seems to be working nicely. It is going to take a while to change the hearts and minds, so to speak. But I was in contact one thing, we have a tremendous partner in our state attorney, Bill Gladson, as we do with the game and fish and the Forestry Service and FDOT, where, you know, everybody has come together to continue to work on this problem, and a lady named Becky Fletcher, who's the county court division chief who deals with a lot of these cases. At the state attorney level, we have eleven cases of primarily dumping, significant dumping cases, the forest and around the county, and four of those have been closed and adjudicated and we still have seven that are open. I can't give you details on them because I didn't get that part of it. But just to let you know, the process is working. We're not trying to put everybody in jail, but some people don't respond to the carrot. They need to stick a little time. So just want to let you know that process is working fine. Thank you very much for that update, Commissioner Curry. I would like to also share some announcements before we open the floor for public comment. Of course, today at 10:00 we will have a public hearing for the county's proposed five year 2024 through 2028 consolidated plan and proposed 2024 2025 annual action plan. And additionally, we will have a public hearing to consider an amendment to the Marion County Land Development Code, the LDC, related to section four 2.23, the rural commercial rc one zoning classifications intent, list of permitted and special uses development standards and design. This afternoon at 02:00 p.m. the commission meeting will reconvene for our regularly scheduled zoning meeting. We will also have an annual joint meeting on March 27 at 09:00 a.m. with the Marion County Public Schools, municipalities and Marion County Board of County Commissioners. That will be at the southeastern Livestock Pavilion and that is published as well. On April 2 at 09:00 a.m. we will convene the Board of County Commissioners again right here in these chambers for our regularly scheduled Board of County Commissioner meeting on the first Tuesday of the month of April, April 2 at 10:00 a.m. we do have the first of two public hearings to consider an ordinance to amend the Marion County Land Development Code Division 4.2 zoning classification to reformat the list of permitted and special use permit uses, development standards, setbacks for uses and structures for principal, general accessory and specialty uses, from a list format to a table format and provide for Scriv",

        "text": " spring as part of the housing production strategy project um we uh completed the community survey which I just mentioned we've done some uh focus groups so those are discussions with organizations that uh traditionally uh serve underserved communities so that we can hear more um from people who are providing services to those communities they're often people in those communities are often hard to reach on their own um in-person events um with traditionally underserved communities I believe the city has done with uh an Outreach with communities of color and youth and then meetings with Neighborhood Land Use chairs Community groups and others there'll be continued engagement as we can continue on in the housing production strategies so what we've heard so far is that affordable housing options are really important at all income levels interestingly bridging gaps between landlords and tenants is something we also heard um and what that me means I think is that landlords may not know some of the uh some of the challenges that tenants face it may be that some perhaps not all landlords um may be interested in engaging with tenants a little differently if they understood some of those uh those barriers so that speaks to something that the city might do about convening um discussions um between landlords and tenants um ensuring quality and support maintenance of existing housing and so how exactly Salem uh goes about doing that is something we'll we'll need to discuss and then a broader div broader variety of housing types to meet diverse needs we just heard about need for multigenerational housing um as you look uh at senior populations especially um single level and ground floor housing is important um including for people with disabilities and then more accessible units Beyond a ADA requirements so these are some of the things that we're hearing that you don't necessarily see in the data um and that's exactly why we're trying to engage with communities Salem's going to build on the existing policies um build new policies in the HPS on existing policies I'm not going to read all of these policies aloud but these are all things that the city has done and is doing um to uh to support development of uh affordable housing so things like Urban uh urban renewal funding that's a way to fund Housing Programs um housing uh developments really I mean projects um as well as infrastructure in key areas and it's often in key areas where you have things like access to services like Medical Services um or access to Transit um there's been a lot of uh regulatory improvements that have happened over the last few years with middle house housing and multif family housing code updates the city has done um and then looking at things like um ready build accessory dwelling unit plans so those are architectural plans that if uh an accessory dwelling unit was built using those plans um then there are fewer uh things that they have to do with the city um uh in order to build that housing there's less approval that you need so there's a lot of things that Salem is doing um you're not starting scratch our next steps are about continuing the engagement with the stakeholders to understand barriers to addressing housing uh need so essentially making sure that we're not missing anything continued analysis of potential development and Redevelopment mixed use areas and that analysis can inform um from a market perspective what kind of supports are necessary um to support development of housing that's affordable at different income levels and then beginning to discuss the potential actions for inclusion in the housing production strategy we'll be talking with the city council and the Planning Commission next week um about some of this and I'm sure they'll be interested in talking about those potential actions um and that will continue on in discussion and that is all we have I'm going to unshare my screen here and I believe that uh Lisa is going to facilitate uh the question and answer answer piece part of this so put your questions in the chat great and we already have some um first two are kind of processed that I'll I'll call on the question is if the slides will be posted on the web page and then if people can access this later yes I will put all of it online as soon as I can perfect so scrolling to the top um let's see someone has a question about United Way Cottage development and about their shared common area you speak to that Unice sure so the requirement in our code for cottage clusters is to have a certain uh area of a common Courtyard which can be landscaping or lawn area doesn't necessarily need to be like an active recreational space and so when those uh United Way Cottage cluster proposals came through um they did meet requirements um there was a comment or question about if uh property if keeping property taxes low for new multif family um penalizes homeowners who don't get breaks and so what I will say is you don't uh cities generally don't do this for all new multif family um development um cities Target the type of multif family development they're looking at um based on what is uh what is BAS best meeting the community needs um so one property tax abatement um is for income restricted affordable housing so that's housing that's most affordable um that tax abatement can be a 20-year tax abatement or longer um and then another type of um multif family um tax abatement is for um what's uh you guys don't call it the multi-unit property tax um mtip mtip okay that's that's what you call it there and so that's a Tim limited property tax abatement and what the city usually gets out of that is housing um that is Affordable at below um market rate for newly built housing um usually and and Unice you you or Lisa can tell us what what the city does but usually it's it's offered over 10 years um and not beyond that um up to 10 years um so to answer your question it does impact the city's coffers um and city funding it doesn't increase um uh uh property tax on existing homeowners um but uh it it's not uh it's not providing the city with that property tax During the period of exemption great thanks Beth um there was a question about who will build small cottages for seniors and who would be studing maximum rent costs and so it really depends on on how those Cottages are built um so if it's market rate Cottages um so it's a market rate developer um and there's no involvement from the uh the city or the state then the uh developer um and then the owner eventually of the Cottages would be setting the the rent costs or the sales costs you can also have uh Cottage clusters and and many other types of housing built um that are built by things like community land trusts um uh and in that case the community land trust is ensuring that housing remains comparatively affordable over a long period of time the household who purchases the housing because Community Land trusts are often purchasing um they will realize a certain amount of appreciation um so wealth generation through home ownership um over time but they won't um uh uh have as much as if they just owned it on the market and when it's sold next it'll be continued to be at that you know lower than market cost um so it's it's complicated and oftentimes when you're looking at affordable rental housing or affordable home ownership housing whether it's Cottages or otherwise it's a a a nonprofit organization um who is uh setting the maximum rents or the maximum sales price um according to agreements that they theyve come when they built it great um there's a question about rent control and uh is the city considering rent control to keep uh rents from going up really fast I have not heard that as being uh something that the city is considering my understanding is the state passed uh Statewide rent control what 2018 19 20 be correct me if I'm wrong that cast it Statewide but I that and I'm not sure that local conversation has occurred there was I think one or two questions about public schools and if we increase our student population how are the schools going to handle that sure so during the r Salem project when we were rezoning a lot of land to allow more multif family development whether in a multif family zone or a mixed use Zone that allows multif family we did meet with the school district because we knew there were kind of concerns or we wanted to make sure we understood the concerns of the school district so we were very thoughtful in terms of where we cited um more multif family land um our understanding at the time was that um the schools in North Northeast uh had capacity issues already were close to having capacity issues but South and West um had some space and that aligned with what we were Hearing in the community anyway in terms of trying to make sure that we had multif family in Western South to create kind of the more opportunities for mixed income neighborhoods um and so um during the r project we did collaborate with the schools and it aligned with the community's priorities as well great and there's a question about um why was land rezoned to mixed use along the transit Corridor if we don't know if it's actually feasible to provide housing was that a state mandate that was not a state mandate um it was a priority that came out of the four-year community outreach project that was our Salem um we heard that people wanted to have access to Transit and frequent Transit um in terms of housing we heard that from folks across you know different housing needs um and in addition to that one of the goals of the council at the time that was set through the uh Council action in the climate action plan was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to site more housing with uh access to Transit so more people could live without having to drive to Services jobs Etc um so it was really coming out of community priorities as well as Council Direction and I will add on that even if it's not financially feasible right now um to develop that kind of housing we are looking at longrange planning um and so the market certainly does change and uh there may be changes um that have nothing to do with housing directly that uh increase feasibility great um there's a question inquiring if anyone on the panel today has ever personally managed a housing project from start to finish with the primary focus on profitability or self-sufficiency without government subsidy so unless Beth has a hidden background that I don't know about I would say we're not developers but you part of the reason that we talk to developers um very specifically and we talk to developers quite a lot on a lot of projects across the state great thanks be um why does Oregon and Salem use 30% of disposable income as the level of affordable housing other",

        "text": " of minimized or delayed the executive board was have started meeting since June or July I'm assuming and the advisory committee hasn't even met yet and I'm I'm not really sure of what uh role does the board or other organization itself see from the advisory committee and it seems like the project selection criteria timeline the like the concepts the technical Concepts all of this should be under the purview of the advisory committee where you know project developers and other entities can kind of discuss these in in an open Forum uh and we haven't even heard about when the first meeting is on the advisory committee so I'm just wondering if if it would do if it would be good to kind of push um or kind of have a word with the executive board on you know what it sees the role of the advisory committee as and uh you know get moving on that so I think that that would be my input uh on kind of having in creased role for the advisory committee and uh having like particular areas of uh input where advisory committee would be more kind of uh in the know especially related to project development so I think that's that's mine but thanks thank you you might see Greg's hands up yeah thank you I was just going to add a note around the um the selection criteria you know it sounds like it's not clear you know exactly how those are going to be developed or when there might be it sounds like there's a draft but maybe it is not input a lot on uncertainty there my point for you Rebecca to kind of take back up north is just that um those shouldn't just kind of stay secret I mean in one way or another I think there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed um in this process because there's so much interest and there's you know a finite amount of dollars um and I think you need to have public some transparency about the selection criteria so people feel like they put their best foot forward they knew how they were going to get graded um to be in the Washington process you know I think the so you know they they have a PDF on their website right now of some some evaluation you know criteria but the list is basically just the stuff that you know anybody who's paying attention knows doe has already said they care about it doesn't actually tell you anything about how you know the Washington process will approach a Washington uh you know putting together a Washington process so I just think some transparency and at least like a document that says here's what the criteria are and here's what the waiting is at the very least you know to make sure the process has some legitimacy to it you know whether you succeed with a project or not thank you Greg I see Evan's hand is up now hey Evan hey there uh thanks thanks for the good meeting um I disconnected so I missed the last few minutes but uh just a little bit on on my perspective of the biggest needs for this Hub right now you know I'm I'm on the advisory committee and and there hasn't been much transparency as far as what our our role will be but um I I do expect there to be some kind um project Review Committee um but what I would encourage Odo to do here is you know I to obsidian's credit and the concept that they've been developing which does have an Oregon presence they're not expecting to use these Hub funds to subsidize projects to a large degree they're really focused on using these Hub funds for um you know the the maximum public good and to help stand up new sectors that can take advantage of hydrogen so um you know I would encourage encourage Odo and others to really think about you know what is the highest and best use of these federal funds whether it's opening up the transportation sector to hydrogen facilitating shared infrastructure like pipelines or large-scale hydrogen um you know maybe building some liquefiers or um other other types of infrastructure that can benefit the entire region and its expansion into a national network thank you Evan I'm not seeing any more hands up right at the moment you know Evan's comment kind of bridged uh the discussion about the association specifically and then also kind of that idea of what we see as what the the key attributes of a Pacific Northwest Hub should be um and what it should be focused on does anyone have any other thoughts around that you know that's already been decided that the Hub only uh include projects that are um renewable energy and electrolysis um so that's the reason and that's also in the Washington State Legislative bill authorize the creation of the association uh so there's no room to maneuver there so that's already been um but it's also looking like based on the projects that um came through the RFI that it's going to be fairly Transportation focused um but what are your thoughts for you know if for what other attributes you'd like to see what these focuses should be um Are there specific Technologies or benefits that we should be focusing on kind of as as Evan mentioned like what do we see as you know kind of the highest and best use of these funds hey Rebecca I see um Kate Kelly and then Ken all have their hands if I think in that order is when they want to all right Kate thank you so um I've said this before to to certainly to you but I I think it warrants um kind of bringing up in this form as well uh I think so I wanted to just describe not so much the um specific focus in terms of the scientific and infrastructure Direction but maybe that second Quest more so of when the right now it looks like the advisory committee has broken up the Hub into several of these kind of small working groups that um span several different fields um I wanted to just uh re-emphasize I think a structure that has been um discussed at higher levels by um our vice president for research which is that considering um the role that academics play as potentially a hub within the Hub where um essentially obviously there's going to be major infrastructure but if there was a way of facilitating or designing this Hub that would allow us to leverage the scientific expertise not only in the research scope that that many of these projects are doing but even more so in the kind of Economics environmental justice space that being able to coordinate among the academic institutions in our region could be a really compelling way of making sure that we are showing that not only are we able to support the hub's development in the translation of um this key technology and Innovation which is supported through many many ways in in universities but also um being really leads in providing that subject matter expertise and and Leadership on these other very critical components of the Hub in social social and environmental justice labor Etc so I know that previously and you've heard me say this before so I apologize but this is a larger larger group um thinking about all those different components and subcommittees within that Advisory Board is great but it might um be worth considering is there a way that we could really leverage our academic institutions as such that we wouldn't expect significant funds or money to come out of that but as a way of positioning our Hub as taking advantage of the discovery Innovation and expertise of our academic resources in a way that doesn't feel diffuse if they were just embedded across a thousand different you know not a thousand I apologize like several um small subsets and so I just wanted to raise that here as a way that I could I could see us read as a region being able um capitalize on that resource in a way that isn't that doesn't just look like we're tagging it on at the end in terms of social environmental justice or labor but having a um dedicated like centralized connected system among academic institutions so you've heard me say that before but I wanted to share it with this group thank you Kate and for those of you who don't know Kate she's at the University of Oregon thank you foreign I think Kelly was next Kelly Ken Greg and Alan and I'll I'll keep following up with you yes Kelly awesome thank you so much so I'm Kelly Hale um I'm with the Eugene Water and Electric Board um and I just am trying to figure out um so we had submitted an original um response to the RFI and trying to finalize some revisions to that uh before the Monday deadline and just the comments that have come earlier It just strikes me as I'm trying to understand what's highest and best use for the region obviously your comment just a minute ago Rebecca you know struck me obviously the the focus on projects to date have been on Transportation because that's where the credits are with clean fuels program in the state um as a utility our interest is really understanding how to make better use of curtail currently curtailed um Renewable Power and figuring out how to support the grid from a resiliency um and so I'm trying to figure out if uh feasibility studies would still be competitive in terms of how people are viewing this um RFI and the resulting selection of projects to move forward into the actual application or if you know I think Ken was just mentioning you know focusing on actual projects and utilizing the money for building of infrastructure if that's more where the focus is interested in being and without the specific criteria to know exactly what your project is being evaluated against and with some of this being somewhat um unknown because we don't have all the details of exactly what this would cost or exactly you know what the economics would be and and which project would move forward we have a lot of things that we're evaluating and so I'm just curious about what you think about how to approach that for inclusion and for making sure that Oregon is getting the learnings that we need in our state and is still represented in the project moving forward thanks Kelly that's a great question and certainly based on what we've seen from from usdoe thus far uh it looks like they're really um they're really focusing on projects that can go right into the ground and get moving and can be self-sufficient over the you know over the course of about eight years there had there was talk and the notice of intent of setting um one or two billion is kind of a technology opportunity and kind of whether that would happen after the initial funding and phase of the hubs and the selection it would be an add-on later or not um I I got the I got the impression they're still kind of thinking through what that might look like um so you know there is probably some opportunity there um we won't know until we see the foa but I also",

        "text": " not necessarily odo but others in the state identify where there's funding to help with their energy projects great point and i think peggy the leaving federal on the table that's part of the concern for sure um and i think that we're sort of more concerned about that from a local government perspective for communities that don't have the capacity to seek out and monitor the funds the funding opportunities and and do the applications so that's where the policy package that uh michael referenced will come to play uh and and i should point out that photo is also a member of the governor's infrastructure cabinet which meets every couple of weeks to talk about the opportunities that there are so we are in the loop for example with odot on funding from the department of transportation for electric vehicles all right all right so if there are no more questions right now obviously feel free to add them as i come in but oda will be proposing three policy option package in the administrative services division and each of these takes a different approach to increase odo's engagement and outreach with the first would fund paid student moto has long offered unpaid internships but we know that not everyone has the ability to participate in an unpaid this pop would allow odo to increase the pool of candidates and provide a more equitable intern experience the pop would be fun this pop would fund two positions which would support 12 part-time paid interns over the course of the biennium and odo is proposing that this uh pop with general fund the funded general our next uh pop is for a public advocate and will allow odo to build upon its outreach to environmental justice communities and to address barriers identified in our work with the ej council the environmental justice council we have found that our work is better when we are able to meaningly meaningfully incorporate thoughtful input and feedback from environmental justice communities and other underrepresented communities and individuals including tribes and rural this pop builds on existing work and also reflects the need for a new capacity because much of the work of this position would be supported by general fund and federally funded programs we are proposing that only a third of it be covered by esa and finally we have a pop that would help build capacity build local capacity within the state by providing services to help communities identify and get funding for their energy projects we've heard a lot about this and this need for this type of service in our recent public webinars on federal funding and i'll ask my colleague jenny to put a link to those webinars in the uh if she can and this budget ask would also supports a legislative concept that the agency is proposing to establish a capacity building program to support our rural tribal and other environmental justice communities as they seek state and federal funding and this pop would be funded with general fund so those are the three slides that uh are the three pops that we have for the administrative services division so i'll just pause here to see if there are any questions about policy option packages or the budget components that we just reviewed not seeing any questions in the chat yet or raised hands just pause for a minute to see if um stacy is seeing any as the host nope cece's not seeing any there so go ahead michael all right so uh here we're looking at a summary of everything we just went through and this is pretty much how we expect to spend and what we expect to spend on each program division including the percentages that each program would be covered with esa so for example in that top line of the director's office expenses would be covered by esa and 48 percent uh esa would cover 48 of central services a lot on this chart so wait a minute here to let people review the chart and see if there are any let's give that a minute i don't know click here anyone is seeing questions in the chat or we'll go on to the next slide but again if you come up with a chest question later feel free to pop it in the chat or raise your hand so here as you're probably familiar from from building your own budget scenario planning is an important part of the budget development process with considerations about how to operate in different environments as part of the state budget process agencies prepare a uh prepare five and ten percent uh budget cut list which outline how each agency plans to respond to a reduction in revenue agencies are required to develop this list by each fund type they receive and this is a summary of oda's reduction targets on the top of this chart you'll see a budget for each division under the sale package and on the bottom you'll see the target for each fund type um the reduction targets shows how much we would be cutting under each of those scenarios note on this chart other funds is sometimes included in general funds due to the internal agency transfers we mentioned earlier and you'll notice that in eds um we'll be submitting a and again in this example you'll see like uh in pni uh at 10 we'd have to uh total budget of other funds of 6.9 uh seven million dollars we'd have to thousand dollars at the 10 percent got less than you see that all rolled up at the end there and so we'll be submitting a more detailed uh cut list with our agency request budget um and can share for those of you who are interested but i'll pause here to see if there are any questions all right sounds like everyone's following along hopefully and getting it so that's great uh and so now we'll just uh have a few slides talking specifically about the energy supplier assessment the energy supplier assessment is established by statute which is for anyone interested and is the method used is the method by which a legislator has chosen to cover most of the operating budget of odo this fee is charged to fuel providers and utilities producing energy in oregon who pass the cost on to their customers the esa is assessed on ratepayers gross operating revenues and is capped at 0.375 percent of revenue the essay under this budget would be much less than that we won't know the exact number until the budget and the the budget and the esa payer revenues are final the next year but in 2022 that esa rate was under 0.13 so here's a history of the esa by biennia for the last decade and as you can see from this chart oto has tried to maintain stability in the supplier even as the makeup and responsibilities of the agency continually evolve you can also see that the 2325 agency request budget resulted in an assessment of 6.69 million dollars for the next biennium remember this figure could change as a put as we go through the budget process the next chart shows the esa in relation to energy supply revenue for the last 10 supply revenue is reported in billions of dollars on using the left access while the assessment is reported in millions of dollars on the right the top orange line is the total revenue by all esa payers while the other lines such as the yellow natural gas revenue are for or by supplier type and the blue it represents cou revenue and you'll know that there has been an increase in revenue across all luxuriously suppliers since 2020. in the next slide our discussions in the june eawg meeting uh i talked about how our budget and its esa impact would change from the current service level presented at that meeting to our agency request budget uh we were presented today with the expectation that the addition of our policy option packages would reduce the esa this is because the additional positions in our policy option packages help spread the cost of our indirect pool to other funding streams as you saw earlier we adjusted our policy option packages in the citing division to only ask for two positions to only ask for the two positions authorized for the current biennium instead of the three positions that were presented at the energy advisor work group uh based on that feedback and today we've also indicated that we to fund the energy research fund with federal funds that we expect to become uh that we expect to receive later this but since we cannot build that into the budget at this time we'll have to ask for that switch later and when that happens we will work with the cfo and legislative fiscal office to shift the funding on this policy option package for the energy research fund and this chart shows uh how those actions will impact esa in the next biennium if odo's budget is approved as proposed i want to stress again that uh our budget and its esa impact can and will change as it goes through the governor's office and then on to the legislature this is the best estimate we can currently provide but it is likely to change and there are um and so as you can see here um these are our projections then the change from csl to arb and then what we um again right now might project is if accepted as proposed in the governance budget are there any questions about the projected revenue need for to fund our or the projected allocation of funds derived from esa in this budget i'm not seeing any questions michael great so we're almost done and we can just uh open it up for any questions on any of this as soon as you're done oh i see that peggy asks if we have a priority list for our pops peggy you're asking me to choose between my children um i i'm gonna have to get back to you on that one that's a really good question and i think um we have plenty of uh policy option packages in here that we're pretty excited about um i think the incentive extended incentive programs which are essentially rolling over um funds that have already been provided but need additional legislative action are are some priority ones um but the other yeah that's like she means that it's hard to choose i will add that we did have a number of pops pop ideas that came up through the agency internally and the ones that we brought to the energy advisory work group and then are submitting as part of our agency request budget are a small portion of the ones that we the ones that our staff identified as needs so i would say what you're seeing are the priorities um and you know we we haven't really developed a priority list we will need to come forward as we talk to the um and the new budget with what the priorities are so i think we're very interested in feedback on what you all think is the are the most important priorities for these pops all right all right so uh thanks uh we're going through that and so where do we go from here so oda",

        "text": ". We will do our best to try to address everything we believed relevant, and we have our team of experts here that will address stuff. I'll try to do this as best in an organized manner, of course, as you have questions, we'll bring up the appropriate consultant and expert to answer your questions. So I want to start off by just, you know, sort of the theme here is that I heard was anti growth sentiment. And I do want to point out that we heard a few residents say they just moved here a couple years ago or a year ago. As Ocala grows and Marion county grows as a desirable area, so do the services that are needed to serve the residents that move here. So, for example, more firefighters are needed, more law enforcement is needed, more nurses to staff, hospitals, et cetera, are needed. All of those people need a place to live, and that's what this community provides. So with that, I think transportation sounded like the biggest issue. So I'm going to go ahead and bring up our consultant, Kakwan Ma, who has performed a preliminary traffic analysis at this stage, even though it is not required at this stage. So I want him to speak a little bit to that and if we can pull up our presentation, please. He has found a few improvements that we are committing to make. And after he speaks, I would like to bring up our traffic consultant with Kim Lee Horn that's actually working with Continental at the major site plan level to speak in more detail. And again, I want to reiterate that this is not required at this stage of development. Sure. Madam chair commissioners, thank you for having me. My name is Kokwan, MA, 225 East Robinson Street, Orlando, Florida 32801. I've got 27 years of experience as a transportation engineer, 25 years of which in development services. So that is both conducting traffic impact studies as well as reviewing traffic impact studies. I currently review traffic impact studies for a number of local governments, including City of Daytona beach. Since 2016, I've had over 190 work orders to. We're good. Okay. All right. Thank you. And we've had your testimony in other cases, so you are familiar to this board. Thank you very much. So we have conducted a preliminary analysis for the Canopy Oaks phase two development, which includes the multifamily component as well as the remaining tracks or lots that front State Road 200. There was a memo that was submitted in September 2023 that looked at the intersection of Southwest 99th Street Road at the Spine Road. A supplemental analysis was also conducted and submitted last week that included the intersection of Southwest 99th Street Road at State Road 200. Based on the analysis for the build out of Canopy Oaks phase two, we have identified improvement needs and have coordinated with Oto to show them what would be needed at that time. And that is shown on your screens currently, which would include a. At the intersection of Southwest 99th Street Road and the Spine road, it would include a left turn lane into canopy Oaks as well as a right turn lane out of Canopy Oaks. Because the spine road currently has a single lane approach, we felt that the right turn lane would be needed to allow for traffic that wants to turn and head towards on top of the world, to be able to do so without being held up by the throughs or the left turns. The left turn traffic or the left turn lane, conversely, would allow traffic to exit out of the through movement and provide safe passage into the Canopy Oaks development. At the intersection of State Road 200 and Southwest 99th Street Road, we have identified a left turn lane from 99th Street Road onto State Road 200 because currently there is a shared left through lane with an exclusive right. So we recommend having the left turn lane and as a consequence of that, we would need to have the signal modified to include the left turn movement out from southwest 99th Street Road. I know you've made those recommendations and the traffic study is not due until the master plan or major site plan returns. But is this something that, on top of the world, has agreed to make these changes and these modifications? That was my recommendation. I can't speak. I'm going to bring up Amber Gartner from Kimley Horn. Thank you. Good afternoon, commissioners. Amber Gartner with Kimley Horn, 1700 Southeast 17th street, suite 200, Ocala, Florida 3447. I'm working with continental on the operational traffic study that is required with the major site plan, and we have preliminarily started on that analysis. We'll coordinate further with staff as we move through that process. But preliminarily we concur with the recommendation from Kittelsen on the preliminary study. And the details of that will be further refined as we do that operational study in conjunction with staff. But is, we preliminarily concur with those findings. Okay, thank you. Yes. Before you step away, Miss Gartner. What? So operationally, the entire intersection there, right. I mean, because people get stuck a little bit coming out of on top of the world right there, trying to get a left out on 200. So adding the additional turn right, it's an additional turn lane. So it's. Yes, it's an additional. So right now, if you're coming out of on top of the world on 99th Street Road, you have two lanes, it's a right lane and a shared through left. So this would add a dedicated left turn lane. And as was previously mentioned in one of the comments, that would come with a dedicated phase as well. So you'd have a dedicated. A green light and green time for that left turn movement. And how much stacking is there? So there's about 250ft, I want to say there. Six, seven cars. Right? Right. So that'd be. Well, that'd be ten cars. Yeah, 810 cars. Okay. And. And typically, when you add that, how many trip. Trips through the dent, you guys have a formula, right, for trips through the intersection. So it's gonna depend on the cycle length. I think the cycling out there is about 150 seconds. So it's about two and a half minutes. So you've got 25 cycles per the hour. So that would be sufficient to accommodate the additional trips. So it more than doubles the left turn capacity that's available today. Right? Yeah. Yes. In stacking as well as in operations, because now we're providing that dedicated left turn phase. That's what I was trying to figure out. Thank you. Before I let Amber go, I just want to confirm that we are agreeing to make these improvements pending the final outcome of Amber's traffic analysis at the major site plan level. But we do know, preliminarily that these improvements are required. The length of the lane may be extended or something with further analysis, but that is being offered. If you want to provide a condition to that effect, we will be happy to do so. Mister Minter. Miss Iserman. So you said we. So the question has been whether it's going to be oto or continental or who's the we that's going to do it, that this is a essentially continental improvement. So I understand Hoa fees and Poa stuff came up, and I do want to talk about that later. But these improvements would be performed essentially or paid for by continental development. That is an agreement between the developer and Continental. I do want. Amber, real quick, just for the record, I'd like you to confirm, is it true that if a commercial development were to go into this location, it would be approximately six times times more traffic or more? So, yeah, depending on the size of commercial development, the amount of square footage that could be within this area is anywhere between four and six times what this apartment complex would generate traffic wise. So from a traffic vesting standpoint, what is being proposed is less intense than a commercial development. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's just please hold your comments. And we're so popular. Thank you. That is the gist of traffic. Do we have any questions on traffic? Well, I think I want to address. Go back to that second access. Okay. What are we going to do if this is approved? That has to be a full access. We are willing to open. The purple circle is a proposed emergency access only. We are willing to open that to a full access point so we can. As a condition, we will change the concept plan from emergency access to full access. And is there any other. I don't care if they. Because I think what part of what you don't want, what I've seen in other. Sorry. In other developments is you don't want people just driving right through there. So if you wanted to put up a gate, that's fine. But you still give access to your residents in and out. Right, understood. But it will be not an emergency only access. It will be a resident accessible at all times. But, commissioner, it's not gated to begin with. The other side is not gated. No worries. You know what I'm saying? And if they're worried about who's coming in and out, they can always put up a camera. Yes, but they aren't gated to begin with. And so can we pull up that whole area, please? The overview area? They can. And they can get from that second access. And I'm just trying to remember the back. The roadway back there behind the public's. Is that accessible to 80th? Yes, it's a winding path. But you can go behind the publix and go out to 80th. Yeah. Make. You can",

        "text": " time for an alternative uh so that we could have a um as we were exploring the Hayden Island alternative alternative one uh that's been pretty much cleared up uh there will be a slight change modification to the route on Hayden Island to avoid there's a dredge spoil area there and we were told by the port of Portland that we don't want to try to trench across that so we're going to avoid that it's a minor minor jog in the route and there may be some other modifications for Hayden Island but it is not going to affect the overall concept of the project next slide the Bonneville Dam bypass is shown here it's about seven miles uh we have done primarily desktop studies but also supplemented with actual surveys in the on areas that we've already identified as being difficult to install a cable in one of those areas is the area just east of the Bonneville Dam and so uh in order to uh avoid that set of problems in terms of installing the cable we are proposing to bring it out uh of the river in Stevenson uh to bypass that Causeway that's part of state route 14. um and that's at the suggestion or the urging of the Washington State DOT but after that to continue using State Route 14 for a few miles until you get to the federal property on the other side of the dam and bring it into the water as you can see uh just west of the well more than just west of the dam to avoid any sort of interference with the facilities and the infrastructure that's already at the dam underneath that area you have heard me refer to converter what's the purpose of a converter station it's to in our case convert AC power from the grid to I should say alternating current power from the grid to direct current why because it's much more efficient it has a number of other advantages that we can go into at Q a it's the most efficient way particularly underwater to transmit large amounts of energy for long distances so that's why we convert it initially in the Eastern to DC power and we take it DC all the way through the route to the other converter station in the west which is the one in the Rivergate area that you saw on the map uh it's then converted back to AC power about three miles of AC line would then be taken to the shore of the Willamette the eastern shore of the Willamette we would horizontally directionally drill under the Willamette why do that because the sediment and the Willamette is contaminated is a Superfund Site so we can avoid that issue by drilling under the water as uh other other uh facilities have done and come up in the harberton substation the conversation sites are about five acres give or take uh the one shown here well I'm sorry what do we have I got two involved in my discussion what did we miss there we go converter station thank you um this is a converter station that was built about 12 years ago in San Francisco the city uh there is a project that goes from the East Bay under the San Francisco Bay into San Francisco the city and this is the conversation that was built there it's similar to a typical substation the large structure is the control building where the conversion actually takes place the technology for the conversion uh is housed in that building so this is about what the uh conversation will look like in the uh industrial area of Portland the site that we have identified uh in conjunction with the port of Portland as I think I said before is an existing vacant site that's been vacant for quite a long time it's a smaller site than typically they're able to develop in that area uh it is uh kind of out of the way in terms of visibility and so uh we feel it it will make a very good site it won't increase traffic in operation because the Manning of these stations is very small and so we feel it could be an ideal site for this purpose slide and at this point for the next slide I'm going to turn it over to my colleague Ernie Griggs has been our project manager for the two under C hvdc transmission lines that we permitted built and continue to operate between New York and New Jersey uh he knows more about this kind of thing than I will ever know uh and I thought for the purposes of explaining how the cable is installed in the river he could give a complete description oh you're probably right hey can everyone hear me thank you all for coming this evening uh this this project is important to folks in the area it's important to us as well for all the same reasons actually there's a I'm going to actually mention that there's a video located outside if if somebody is really curious about taking a look at that before they leave for the evening I'm sure we can we can uh set that up and and give you a chance to see it the hydro plow the jet plow those are common terms for it they allow us to do a simultaneous cable lay burial um we have the ability to get the cable buried 10 to 15 feet into the riverbed the way that works is we will have cable spooled on either a cable lace ship or a barge probably more likely a barge for most of this operation uh for our Neptune Project we would have 26 miles of uh high voltage cable 26 miles of neutral voltage cable and 26 miles of fiber optic and it would be bundled together and we would bring it back off the the back of the the boat and then it goes down in catenary down into the the uh the funnel end of the uh what we call the Stinger the Stinger is a rectangular box that has the ability to to rotate that gives us the ability to control depth uh on the front corners of that Stinger there are multiple high pressure water jets we have the ability to control the ability or the ability to control the the rate at which the sediments are emulsified and in so doing that allows us to go along at a predicted rate of of speed typically we can do about what a mile and a half in a day is that what we're we're typically thinking so it's a slow process it's a carefully monitored process we've got data coming off from the hydroplow which is down on the riverbed and as that sled it is often called a sled as that sled is moving forward it's emulsifying the sediments the cable comes out the bottom of the stinger and goes right into the bottom of the trench and as we go past the sediments come out of Emulsion and go right back into the into the trench and so it's a simultaneous lay burial operation that is done almost as as soon as we're there and as a practical matter we work with the agencies to make sure that we understand turbidity we make sure we understand the sediments we'll be going out to get sediment samples before long and as we understand what the content of the sediments in the river are we will in turn work with the agencies as to how we manage turbidity how we monitor turbidity and we can adjust whether it's the water pressure whether it's the rate of of movement of the jet plow through the riverbed we can do that as a means of controlling a major parameter that people are concerned about there's also this this video that can play out in the hall out or out in the room out there we also have that it's available on YouTube and we're talking now about reaching out to the OEM our cable supplier and seeing if we can get that as uh an opportunity to to put it up on our website and give people access to it so that they can see it and learn more about it this is of all the things we've talked about this has been one of the the most significantly discussed items that we the photo on the right is is really what you see for a cable installation on the surface of the water there'll be a barge tug there'll be probably a couple of support boats that go with that that they call that typically a marine spread in that Marine spread it's going to start they have to lay in the cable at the initial end that they begin at that cable will be uh basically floated on the top of the of the river at that point they will put a coupling on the end of the cable they will bring it down to the uh conduit that's behind a coffer Dam and with working with divers we will connect a steel pole cable to that cable and we'll draw it up through the conduit and we'll bring it up to our our transition joint on land so that's how that process works and then once we have that uh in place we'll do it with each cable once we've got those in place we will then start with our lay burial process and start moving up River um it's I don't want to say it's a simple process but whoever thought of it was pretty darn clever I'll give them that for sure so that's pretty much what I have you might want to mention the work windows I didn't talk about that uh we will get there yes okay all right thanks Ernie uh next slide please this is a preliminary schedule uh we're well aware that the process for approving a project like this is going to be a lengthy one so this isn't this is a schedule that we believe we can meet based on our experience uh but with the full understanding that there's a lot of process to go through uh before we can start actually construction um however uh both the project in San Francisco and the projects that we constructed uh between New York and New Jersey took less time than this so uh with with you know proper review and taking into consideration public comment agency comment uh everything that goes into that uh we feel we can meet this schedule and have the cable online by the end of 2028 or um at worst midpoint of 2029 the key point of that date of course is the deadline of 2030 by which the states should meet 80 percent of their decarbonization goals so that is uh very much part of a driver uh of this of this schedule uh next slide please just to sort of recap some of the key the whole point is to help the States achieve their clean energy goals we don't believe that this is the only solution in terms of transmission or any other kind of technology to meet those clean energy goals but given that the utilities are projecting thousands of megawatt of extra",

        "text": " version of standard 100 is that it's now um kind of structured based on Gross energy use and um you know gross energy use would uh kind of add together any grid supplied electricity plus on-site renewable electricity for example to calculate a building's total energy use footprint um energy use intensity the um organ statute is based on um and the organ BPS will be based on net energy use so with the net energy use concept a building would get a benefit from um you know it wouldn't necessarily count against a building's energy use if it were generating and using um renewable energy on site um where the gross energy use concept it would count toward a building's total energy use any renewable energy that's generated on site so we've had to go through and modify the um the language in there to take into account the net energy use concept um where a building doesn't necessarily get penalized for on-site generation that's used at the building site so just one thing that you'll notice as you go through um we've tried to also kind of pair up um Washington State's Building performance standards since organs was modeled pretty closely after Washington's um as we go through and bring in elements of that standard um although one of the things that we've noticed is that you know Washington's BPS was based on a previous version of standard 100 and a lot of the Washington amendments to standard 100 actually made it into the 2024 version of that standard so which is what we're basing our our VPS on so um some of those have already been Incorporated in the base document that we're working on off of um and then also just uh We've one of the the things that we kind of talked about with our uh Ru making advisory committee are considerations for what's part of this so there's a requirement in the standard for an energy and Emissions management Plan and there's a number of criteria elements that are listed under that plan that that shall be incorporated into the plan um some of the elements are you know a little more critical probably than others so um you might notice as you go through the Draft rules that there's some elements that are listed as like shall be incorporated and others that are listed and that we modified that may be incorporated into the plan so that's one thing that we're interested in is some feedback there from a balance perspective of like what are the critical elements of this plan what are the best practices that um that should be included um but maybe aren't completely necessary to try to have a a good and kind of a fair balance between um effort that's in that's required to develop and implement the plan um and things that are just kind of nice to have um from a like from a building owner's perspective so um so as we kind of go through just some flagged areas for input um that we're hoping to get some input on and definitely doesn't need to be today um you know you can definitely submit them through the comment forms but we are you know we've got these definitions for like what does it take to be a qualified energy auditor what does it mean to be a qualified energy manager and a qualified person and each of these different um like roles has a different uh you each of these different titles has a different slightly different role within a building performance standard so like a qualified energy auditor if a building owner a if a building isn't meeting the energy use performance Target then the requirement is that they generally need to do an audit identify Energy Efficiency measures um to help that building get down to energy performance levels to meet the standard um and to do that they need to hire a qualified energy auditor so um you know what does it mean to be a qualified energy auditor right now we've got uh kind of three criteria in there that would allow somebody to be an auditor either a a licensed architector engineer engineer um an ashray building energy uh like um beam building energy auditing um like certification or um there's also another auditing certification from the aee a certified energy auditor the same organization that um certifies energy managers so there's another certification in there so there's like one of those three criteria those three certifications are listed right now for somebody to be a qualified energy auditor so um you know interested in any feedback from there similarly there's a number of criteria that would allow somebody to be an um qualified energy manager and a qualified person and a qualified person uh in the for the purposes of the standard is the one that is um mostly responsible for like evaluating the um energy use and the appropriate energy targets for a building and then submitting to Odo the um appropriate compliance documentation so there's a number of criteria that we've listed um and it's similar to what's in standard 100 now and also to the way that the Washington um program defined it for what does it mean to be a qualified person so we're definitely interested in in comments there um I talked a little bit about the like the energy and Emissions management plan you know what are mandatory versus kind of what are best practice components of that plan we're interested in some um input with that section to have the right strike the right balance between um you know level of effort and kind of the benefit of things that go into that plan um there's some language within the standard that relates to exported energy um and measurement versus estimation so 349 is pretty specific about um not including energy use for Transportation uh against a building's total energy use so like things like EV when it's you know fed through the building's electrical system shouldn't count toward a building eui for the purposes of meeting the BPS in some cases that's measured um and a building owner can um can just subtract that out through an additional calculation but there's also some language in standard 100 that might allow for like estimation of some of those exported energy uses so exported for beneficial use uh so we're interested in any comments around there um and then also so there's a section that details the responsibilities of an energy manager um like the energy manager that a building owner um assigns to to a building and a lot of those responsibilities deal with like what's that energy manager's role within an organization within um like that the covered buildings organization so you know definitely interested in comments on on those responsibilities that are listed within the standard um and I so I've just highlighted a few areas for input here um but you know we've got the entire chapters 1 through six out there for for draft comment and we definitely want to hear back any comments that um relate to anything on chapters one through six so I think now it would probably be a good time to pause just to take any like high level questions comments on um any of the the Draft rules um that we've got up there now because the next section just talks about like what's coming down the line with the rulemaking and stakeholder engagement process so um yeah happy now to to look at any Q&amp;A that might have come through with regard to the Draft rules but you know again definitely encourage folks to submit um any comments you might have by you know through the through the forms using those the comment forms that we've got up so far Blake I don't see additional questions but oh okay I do see a couple raised actually yeah just came in so okay so I've got um I've got Brad Reid and then Tim Miller with a raised hands so I'll uh okay and then we have a question go them first okay okay go ahead Brad I think you're yeah got me all right thanks Blake uh thanks for all the folks putting on the public forum uh this is Brad Reed I run the building resilience Coalition a lot of our groups watching uh this Ru making really closely excited uh for good outcomes I just wanted to make a kind of a comment and actually a bit of praise for Blake and Odo uh I've been observing the rack meetings um understanding of course the law was written to focus on energy intensity usage um I feel like you all have not lost the thread that's in the legislation that says um also to seek to reduce Greenhouse uh gas emissions to the maximum possible um through energy use which of course we know uh generally if you lower energy use increase efficiency you reduce emissions so I just wanted to say thank you for keeping that through line uh during the rul making we sometimes no legislative intent doesn't always translate to rules uh and so just want to mention that uh as far as the general amendments were concerned yeah thanks thanks Brad thanks for that and thanks for your engagement um let's see going next to Tim Miller Tim you should be unmuted thanks so much for this Blake and everyone else who's hosting I um I think I my question relates a little bit to what Brad just brought up and I appreciate this um I know you got a ton of ground to cover Blake so but there was that early slide where you talked about net use and gross use and not ghg use and I wonder if you can um help me with instead of ghg um it's you know I'm pretty concerned about ghgs I get that that's not always in the direct um well I I get that that's a a question mark and how how do you look after that how do you optimize it on that um uh so can you say more about that sure yeah so house build 349 is um is pretty specific about our building performance standard based on site energy so it's the the energy use that is um kind of used and measured at the building site so you know think you like your utility meters um so our energy use intensity targets will be based on like a kbtu per square foot per year um of energy that's used at the site um if you look through ashray standard 100 itself it um kind of offers both options either an eui Target or a greenhouse gas intensity Target and to calculate that greenhouse gas intensity Target it's um you know directly related to the site energy use but it just applies an emissions Factor um you know a stationary combustion emissions factor for things like natural gas or propane and then um a scope to electricity emissions factor for um on-site electricity use and then it just converts that energy use to a greenhouse gas Target um and the standard 100 actually provides that framework too where it offers tables with greenhouse gas building greenhouse gas Targets in there also um so it kind of offers both but within the Oregon building performance standard we will be only focusing on the site energy use kobus per",

managing imbalances real-time lease costs dispatch to minimize the cost for handling lower cross integration of renewables can lower the cost of entry and open more opportunities for smaller scale projects to compete and types of benefits measuring both the tangible and the avoided cost benefits of rto formation and then we get to the the kind of the thrust of this question was around benefit flow through to retail customers multiple commenters contend that to ensure net benefits reach customers benefits should flow through power costs or other automatic cost recovery drop utility incentives the independent dispatch of resources by an rto effectively removes quality utilities incentive to operate efficiently to maximize profit may make sharing mechanisms earnings tests etc unnecessary as a result as a comment from one commenter and then of course multiple commenters highlighted a clear role for the puc in this in this respect having a mechanism to ensure benefits directly flow to retail customers could be established by the puc as a condition for iu joining an rto oregon regulators need to have a seat at the table during conversations related to rto formation and a meaningful regulatory role within the rto itself and one commenter noted that perhaps customer retail rates can be characterized as the measuring stick to evaluate the benefits to retail customers so it's quite a bit there uh that was the genesis of the feedback we received on question three focused on oregon retail customers so i will open up for feedback thoughts here anything you feel strongly about that you support or oppose emphasize differently or something missing and thank you representative marsh for the dedication i see you there on the hey adam spencer here i think on this question i would um separate out impacts on residential rate payers and commercial and industrial and speaking for the part of the market suppliers of power to large customers industrial and um part of the value proposition of an rto for that customer class is the ability to reduce integration costs of renewables that they want to procure um or other resources too through a direct contract with a retail and i think that set of literature review did that looks at integration costs for resources directly serving retail choice load is it is a different set of issues than a pass-through mechanism or some other question about residential retail rates on the power so just to distinguish between those two i guess for the larger group thank you spencer it's uh fred hewitt hi so the this is uh one of those imponderable there's been you know lots of studies of benefit or net benefit from markets including some run by the markets california iso publishes their eim quarterly update uh myso midcontinent iso publishes i think an annual report dollar shows several billion dollars in net benefits um and i think those studies are legitimate the question is how accurate are they you know there are a lot of imponderables in this and many of the studies including the state-led market option study that as i just saw this morning has now finally got its final release do a lot but recognize that they don't do everything in assessing the question so i think my general sense is on balance markets have shown to give benefits but there are also times when you have to wonder and what happened in texas in february is good example what happened in california a couple decades ago but even some ongoing things i think that the influence of elevated pricing in the southern california gas market has significantly increased the costs in the power market including spillovers here to the northwest uh there is some investigation going on with that in california don't know if it's going to turn out what i'm really saying is that there are price risks in markets that we have to pay attention to and market design is really important for protecting customers over the long run from a situation which may be fine 99.5 percent of the time and that one half of one percent of the time can really hit you hard so we have to be very aware of that but uh and then that's you know considering the kind of the macro level then the question of how those benefits flow down to customers in our bills is another layer of this and there are obviously some complicated questions we're going to have to work thank you fred curious are there are there good better best examples out there um from other rtos that um anyone knows about and is interested in just curious what's well this is right again a lot of studies have been done one of the things i wish had been done more is uh you know more of an independent in some of the existing markets uh we've had a long time with them now and it's not an easy thing to do i realize but uh this is something ferc probably should have taken up a long time ago there was kind of a assumption that ferc would do a review of market benefits you know a couple decades ago when all this really began getting off the ground and never done it with an independent study you know by ferc or by an academic organization or think tank or whatever that was you know pretty balanced and pretty thorough uh you know focusing on an existing market or a market you know proposed would that provide some additional value yeah but then again you're right back to the question of what assumptions get made what models are being used and what you know what end value can we get out of it but i think there are some good examples i think that the kaiso eim study is good for what it does the miso study i've looked at it is pretty good for what it does but again you always have to wonder is something being left out fred can you comment maybe expand on your something might be left out you mentioned that twice well i'll give an example of the state-led market options study the now people are calling it the utah study it wasn't just utah but nonetheless uh very explicitly says you know here's the things we're looking at and here are the categories that we cannot really deal with here because we have limited time or you know analytical capability and here are some issues that we are not going to quantify for various reasons typically reliability benefits are a big part of that and the there are fundamentally difficult questions under analytically difficult questions underneath what's the loss of load you know what is the value of lost load that's a kind of a technical term i'm not happy with any of the you know analytical uh assessments of that texas hasn't served them well you know but is that a real thing yeah sure it surely is but there's value judgments under a lot of that make it difficult to do the analysis for things that aren't directly observed as transactions in the market any other thoughts or feedback on this i you know i adam i'd reflect that when i talked to regulator colleagues around the country um within a couple of years of being in an rto the conversation switches uh into this is the status quo is it serving us and is there something better right that the question flips i think that's why you know fred's pointing to a lack of studies but i think that's why they're hard but also because the frame of reference just changes and so this is a question when you step it rapidly stops being quite framed quite the same once you are in and so that sort of argues as many things have so far to rules set up in such a way as you step into the new status quo that you're going to be able to manage through what comes up because it becomes your becomes simply the water you're swimming in at that point and you're evaluating uh alternatives against that as your status quo so i think that's part of the challenge we have when we look at other rtos after their 20 years of history and and ask this question all right i don't see any more feedback on this one i will move on to question number so question number four uh we really tried to get at um some higher level feedback around principles some of which we have talked about already today but you know are there high level principles core principles that should really guide oregon's evaluation of potential rto so this was uh i kind of framed this question earlier that was raised by one commenter but a foundational question can stakeholders clearly articulate what perceived a potential problem or problems exist if any with the current transmission operations and rto might solve so sort of getting back to that question of what is the problem we're trying to solve here for before addressing the principles but potential core principles uh almost universally uh the concept of uh was mentioned although it's pointed out by one commenter it was suggested this is actually a ferc requirement for an rto so maybe uh not framing it as much of a as a principle but sort of a prerequisite um diversity of representation uh fair and equitable governance structure that represents geographic and stakeholder diversity to ensure an equitable distribution of benefits was raised by many commenters and we've heard uh some of those comments here today balance involvement of state regulators governance that incorporates formalized and ongoing state regulator input and protects against the single state influencing rules and policies transparent and inclusive decision transparent decision making regarding program proposals initiatives and amendments that is inclusive of rto participants and non-participants cost allocation that costs shared broadly among customers based upon principles of cost causation including for the revenue requirements of existing transmission market power again similar to the independence uh was uh suggested by multiple commenters that market design should mitigate market power and disincentivize market but that this is also something required by ferc reliability any market design should strive to improve regional reliability which may include imposing minimum resource requirements on participants continuation of this state policy market design must take into account and be compatible with state ghg and clean energy policies which in oregon's case means the market should facilitate cost-effective and timely decarbonization through the integration of clean energy resource adequacy market design should ensure that all participants are held to a common standard for transmission and capacity planning to ensure reliability in r.a an ra standards should be applied equitably across participants and should be resource agnostic with regard to the contribution of capacity value for",

        "text": " emails um that the two council members received you all have those um Chase mcfay Walker who's the Project Lead has provided those to the applicant and we put them in the record of the project um so this is one thing that's important to make sure that it's all disclosed so that any final decision by the council um is an appropriate decision and it's based only on information on the record so now this information is on the record um so my recommendation to you should you receive emails in the future is to do exactly that do not respond um you know forward them to us if somebody engages you in a you know verbal conversation or calls you on the phone um my recommendation is to politely cut that off um and you know should you receive re any kind of substantive information from them it would need to be disclosed on the record um such as we're doing today um and forwarded to the applicant to make sure that they have an opportunity to respond to any information um as well um what we've done with the two emails that we received or to the the people who sent them is we've responded to them um and told them we're not in a public comment time frame um you know it's it's not the right time to provide information you know to council members you know to influence them really in any way whether you're for or against a project um but we want to try to Pivot those people away towards staff we do not have those limitations um so we're not subject to that same limitation it is our responsibility to work with the applicant to work with the public to provide as much information on how the process works um and so we responded to them and said you know please don't send more emails to council members but we are here to help you we are here to um walk you through our process the project do whatever we can to help you fully uh participate in the process so that's what we want to Pivot towards is getting those people towards the department and away from Council um so yeah I would say um you know essentially this is this is primarily a quasi judicial body not a legislative body you you do legislation when you do rul making but the applications and amendments are Quasi quasi judicial and you are limited to the record um so it is very important that you know these projects be treated fairly um you know again doesn't matter if somebody's proposing being a proponent or an opponent of the project that all that information has to be on the record so um I know you know this is some new to some of you um some of you have had extensive experience dealing with these issues so I would just stop at this point and say is there any questions or thoughts or ideas or you know preferences in the way you would like to handle this obviously we have to have in a legal way but there are a number of ways that we can handle it um you know as well so I just wanted to throw that up in terms of any thoughts or ideas or any experiences you'd like to share um if you've dealt with this issue before so council member con yeah I have a question I have never dealt with um this before so um the fact that it's not a public comment period um but now it is part of the record how does um that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that it's not a public comment period but the comment is included in the record so could there be a lot of emails that come in a non-comment period that and end up being part of the that we do this time and time again well only if they search you out and find your information um if they send an email to us um or try to provide comment to us we let them know this is not a public comment period it doesn't go into the record the same way we're not obligated to provide that information because that's not part of the decision record it's outside of a comment period we don't share it with you um that then has no potential influence on you but in this instance if you know for for your sake council member Condon you received this email and if you didn't share it and then later on you use information in that email to help make your decision on the project and that wasn't shared with the applicant and that wasn't shared with the other council members that could jeopardize the actual final decision whatever it is um if if that's found out on right what I'm a little bit confused about is that it seems to me there's an advantage to sending emails and having them in a non-comment period and having them as part of the record yeah well certainly that's why we don't provide your email addresses we don't share your email addresses or your phone numbers to preclude just that type of thing um and so you know again we've we've responded to you know those folks and let them know you know there are comment periods the better way is to wait and submit comments to the council members during those comment periods in the meantime we staff are happy to work with you to you know Express you know or to share you know how our process works and how they can best participate in our process I think this is you know not untypical where we are um a project is proposed in a new area and you know people don't have experience working in this format uh and they are doing what makes sense to them to try to influence the final decision decision again we have very specific kind of procedural rules and requirements and you know I'm sure unbeknownst to them this was not the right way to provide information and we want to Pivot and direct them to that right way um but make sure by the time we get to that point we've had an opportunity to answer any questions they have to educate them so they best know how to respond you know in terms of their comment again related to council standards these are the things that you're limited by and just if I can and that email did not come to me I just want to say that it went to somebody else so was forward it to me got it thank you chair gr oh oh go ahead gra um yes this is ampire just a quick question if somebody provides comments during the non-official comment period as in this case um did they have the same appeal rights as so it you have to offer it during the public comment period um to be part of the rais it or wave it kind of requirements yes yeah thank you C member that is correct so this does not register them as having commented which would allow them to request participation in the contested case because it's outside of that particular comment period but should it have any potential influence on you know a decision you know by a council member that's what we need to um fix on the record thank you chair Grill Vice chair how if I could ask U is there a certain staff person if any of this continues in the future that we should forward uh always forward to me um okay yeah I think that's best I mean you can certainly forward it to the Project Lead um but you know sometimes particularly early on the project you may not remember who that is so you're you're always you know available to send it directly to me um and then you know myself and then whoever the Project Lead will will handle sort of responding to the person and you know again working to make sure that the information is disclosed on the record like we are today yeah I'm I'm just going to add following follow this is Patrick Ro doj uh following up on your question council member Condon I haven't looked into this issue but how I would like to see it resolved if uh assuming that I find support for it is while we have introduced it in the record so it's acknowledged that it has been received it should be excluded from your consideration and any decision making okay that makes sense Vice chair how yeah thank you so an application hasn't been made but they sent what what's the name of the status of it right now they made it's still in the notice of intent State notice of intent yeah so it's you know we we had the notice of intent submitted we had the public information meeting um we had a comment period associated with that we received you know a fair number of comments um based on you know our own evaluation of the notice of intent as well as the comments we issued the project order which is the you know list of standards and requirements that the applicant has to submit um the applicant is currently working on their application we should be receiving it um relatively soon within the next couple of months is what we understand um so it is coming soon but even then we won't have a public comment period until we issue the draft proposed order so we're still the ways out from having the next public comment period this is chair Grail I think the one thing that you can you know there is an opportunity to acknowledge the work that has been done around communication and even though they've been a little misguided and when they could apply it does show that people are paying attention and so the importance of us continuing the way we have been and always looking to do better is shouldn't be lost in all that yeah and I think this is what we you know obviously there's going to be a lot of interest in this project and and we want to do as much as we can to you know not just Orient people to the kind of proper way to do it but to educate them um you know what I didn't mention is I actually had a phone call from somebody who was trying to find council member buyer's email address um and I know politely that no I'm not going to be providing you that but that I pivoted to you know how our process works what can we do to help you better prepared to you know review the application review our draft proposed order you know and provide substantive comments that you know potentially could influence the council member's decision so um it was a good pivot I had a very good conversation with her talked with her about a half an hour um she definitely was appreciative of that and indicated that she would would be um you know getting back to me in the near future for probably thoughts and ideas on you know how to better understand our process so that that's essentially what we try to do um but it is to try to you know limit people trying to influence you outside of the correct ways within process so just a question with respect to what after oh Cindy Condon",

        "text": " low-income and disadvantaged communities in the event of a grid outage and maximizing household and Community ownership models in Solar Technologies next slide please so in order to achieve those impacts and outcomes we'll have to take on certain the application from the US EPA breaks those down into a distributed solar Market strategy a financial assistance strategy which they would like to see 75 percent of the funds to be used for financial assistance for these projects and then a project deployment technical assistance strategy and an equitable access and meaningful involvement plan all of these applications right now are early stage Concepts which we'd love to discuss with you all today and with that I'll hand this over to Rob Del Mar to start to introduce our early stage thank you Jen and just an audio check is it coming through okay there we go okay so for Oregon's concept to spend these funds we've got some um some broad goals that I'll describe momentarily and then we also have some more programs specific ideas um that I'll cover in future slides so from the big picture we really want to utilize these federal funds to bring benefits of solar installations to low income and other disadvantaged communities in Oregon and to do that we know we're going to need to be working with Community Partners to reach out to these disadvantaged communities it will involve increased incentives for multi-family and Community solar projects that provide benefits to low-income participants um we also would like to develop some long-term strategies that can remain in post 2030 when the federal funds are no longer available we would like um essentially low-income participation in future solar programs in Oregon even when the federal funds are all spent and finally kind of over all of these goals we would like to have a Workforce Development program so that we have a diverse and Equitable Workforce to essentially install all of this solar that we hope to install in the next five years so this is a quick view of the different program tracks that we would like to develop within solar for all and it starts with single family and this will be again an increased incentive for low-income participants to be able to access benefits of solar installations on their own homes and for folks that do not own their own homes we have plans to also develop a multi-family incentive um and I'll get into these in a little bit more detail in a moment um and when we can't get the solar on site we also have two different approaches for Community solar projects and one is community solar in investor owned utility service territories and another is community solar in consumer owned utility service territories and that's most of the rural parts of the and again overarching all of this we would like to be working on Workforce Development so that we can reach um into every corner of the state with a um with an able Workforce and living wages to get all this work done in the single family program we we really want to utilize these federal funds to increase the incentive stack and cover a high percentage of project costs and today we have had many different solar programs in Oregon they've provided millions of dollars worth of incentives to oregonians over the years and primarily we've been able to reach um affluent households and moderate income households but we haven't done a great job of reaching low-income households with these programs and so increasing this incentive stack with the federal dollars is one way we can see to do that we will be leveraging Energy Trust of Oregon programs and the Oregon solar and storage rebate programs that are already developed already have a known application process an online application platforms we want to utilize these existing programs to essentially minimize the administrative burden for contractors and homeowners to access these additional federal funds um we also recognize that to reach a new group of program participants we're going to have to coordinate with partners and the Oregon housing cap agencies Habitat for Humanity all of these organizations and many others we plan to work with so that we can make sure that we can access this new market and also coordinate work with other contractors that may be doing Roofing or insulation or efficiency work in the same low-income housing space and finally we'd like to explore ways to extend the federal funds to essentially Provide support to the low-income Market beyond the grant period ending in 2030. and when we talk about increasing the incentive stack this is a very simplified example of what that incentive stack might look like for a typical project and so in this table we look at a system size of five kilowatts which is a little smaller than an average system size in the overall residential Market in Oregon but still a system that can generate sixty percent forty to sixty percent of the household energy consumption for a typical home we're looking at an average cost of four dollars per watt which is what we see in the residential market now so that gives us a total project cost of twenty thousand dollars per installation our current programs are the Oregon solar and storage rebate program which provides a five thousand dollar and for customers that are within Energy Trust of Oregon service territories that's customers of PGE and Pacific there is also the energy trust solar Within Reach rebate and so in this example we have the five thousand dollar rebate that would be made available by Energy Trust for a 5kw system in Pacific Power territory so when these numbers start adding up we um there's two more pieces here one is a federal tax credit and that is calculated at 30 percent of the eligible project cost of a system and that has a few issues with it in the low income space and we'll get into those in a moment and then finally what's left in this stack is what is normally the homeowner contribution which may not be a huge lift for some of the more affluent homeowners but for low income it proves to be a real hurdle for getting into the solar market and that's this estimated funding Gap and for our purposes right now this is serving as a proxy for the federal incentive that we would likely offer in solar for all so this is just a real quick look at the project cost and the finding the um Financial incentive stack that could bring solar installations within the cost range of low-income households in and a few things that we need to keep in mind one monetizing the federal tax credit can be a challenge if the homeowner and in some cases low-income homeowners don't have adequate federal tax liability to take that federal tax credit and as we saw before that's worth forty five hundred to six thousand dollars depending on where the system is and how big it is it's a big piece of the puzzle and we're going to be working with um with Federal Partners to see how we might utilize a new option to get a direct pay rather than a tax credit for um for that share of the funding puzzle and to do that we think we're going to have to work with third-party partners and those might be non-profit entities within the community it could be done at a Statewide level it could be done with commercial partners and that's something that we're going to be working on throughout the application period but also well into the first year of the program implementation and planning we also would like to leverage additional funding Partners to hopefully increase volume and if we go back to the incentives stack you see the five thousand dollar incentives from the Oregon solar and storage rebate program that's ossrp and also Energy Trust of incentive rebates five thousand dollars those incentives are subject to the budgets Within These programs and we can foresee a scenario where um the real limiting factor to the number of homes that we can serve is not the federal funds but the funding within our own in-state programs so what we would like to do on this second bullet point is see if we can leverage additional funding Partners to essentially increase the volume of the the number of households that we can serve with our existing programs within the state and then of course post-grant planning this is hopefully leaving some tools in place that will enable the solar industry to remain active in low-income spaces after the grant period and of course this involves supporting the existing solar industry in Oregon and hopefully completing some Workforce a few of the questions that we've got and again as as Jen mentioned we have a portal open for folks to ponder these um at your own time um but really some of the key questions we have is how can the Coalition reach low-income and disadvantaged communities how can the Coalition serve residents in manufactured housing should a financing product looked again this might be used to increase the volume of the program and then how can Community organizations support and benefit from these program offerings again there's no urgency to answer these questions today we have a a q a portal open where we hope to gather your feedback in the coming weeks um moving on to multi-family here the objective is to support solar installations for low-income households and multi-family housing developments again the idea is to utilize federal funds to increase the incentive stack help bring these solar projects onto more of these multi-family housing developments and again we're able to leverage Energy Trust of Oregon and Oregon solar and storage rebate programs to both bring State funding to the incentive stack but also to minimize the administrative burden and we also see in the multi-family space that this is a good place to support storage installations where we may be able to provide backup power options for residents and multi-family housing units and this backup power might be able to support a common space heating cooling refrigerators charging the types of services that are most needed when the power does go out and so we would like to bring that energy resilience into the multi-family space we have programs that do it in single family but for the federal funds we just get a lot more bang for the buck doing storage and multi-family which is why we would like to do it in this program to really stretch those federal funds for and so again here's how it would kind of look where we have a rooftop solar program and that would deliver Bill savings to the residents of multi-family houses and then finally and also on battery storage for energy resilience and that brings us to some questions and the first one is how can the Coalition ensure that the benefits from a solar and storage installation are passed on to the residents of a multi-family housing unit and not just the owner and we have several developers in Oregon that have already done this successfully and we think that we can get this built into a program so that we have a prerequisite that anyone participating is passing these benefits onto the residents and not just the owner and of course this is another reason why we like battery",

and again thank you mr ratcliffe for your thorough presentations on items b and c thank you mr vice chair members of the thank you jesse thank you thanks so much kent for taking care of that um and jesse again thank you for your portion as well um so the next item we have on the agenda is a project updates so odo project leads will provide brief updates on their active projects i believe katie clifford is going to start us off good morning katie good morning madam chair grail members of the council can everybody hear me all right thank you for the record my name is katie clifford and i'm a senior sighting analyst with the department my colleagues wally adams and chase mcclay walker and i will be providing updates on projects under council review during the july council meeting senior sighting analyst kellen tardy tardyweather provided updates on one transmission line and five solar energy those are the boardman to hemingway obsidian solar west end solar blue marmot solar archway solar and bike oven solar projects today we will provide updates on three solar projects one wind project one combination wind and solar project a system reliability project and a proposed renewable diesel production the first is the bonanza energy facility which is a proposed solar photovoltaic or pv energy generation facility with a generating capacity of between 150 megawatts and 300 megawatts depending on the solar module technology you selected real quick we don't have the powerpoint up so it's either danita needs to get the powerpoint up or have you do it so i'm not sure who is going to run it but um there are slides associated with this agenda item my apologies i thought i was screen sharing and uh i will fix that right thank you for letting me know sure can you see my screen now it's not yeah it's uh it's coming up yep okay thank you so much for telling me that's important all right so the first is the bonanza energy facility as i said a solar pv facility uh the applicant is hecate energy bonanza llc who proposes to develop the facility in klamath county on approximately 2733 acres of private land the solar array itself would occupy approximately 1800 acres which is roughly equivalent to 2.9 square miles the facility would be located approximately one mile southeast of the town of bonanza so as you'll see on the slide the maroon outline in the upper portion of the slide shows the limits of the city of bonanza bonanza itself is located approximately 25 miles east of plano falls in addition to the solar array the proposed facility would include electrical collector lines inverters and an on-site facility substation and an 8-mile long 500 kilovolt transmission line with the point of interconnection at bonneville power administration's substation near mullen the facility would also include an operations and maintenance building service roads and gated access points access roads and construction areas as well as an up to 1100 megawatt battery storage system the battery storage system just to give you a sense of scale would be housed in up to 11 separate enclosed structures that would occupy approximately 91 acres the applicant submitted the notice of intent last year on august 7th and following that on october 13th the department hosted a public information meeting to discuss the notice of intent and the fsec process during the 61-day comment period which was extended based on public requests the department received 18 comments from government entities six comments from stakeholder groups and 89 comments from members of the public so for an early stage of the process that was a pretty substantial amount of participation we anticipate receiving the application during the first quarter of next year in the meantime we understand the applicant is meeting with local stakeholders and doing necessary field survey work and even though we're not in a formal comment period on the project we continue to receive regular comments and questions from members of the public asking questions and supporting or opposing the project on october 18th so quite recently the community opted to host their own meeting to discuss the proposed facility so just to be clear that was not a council meeting or an odo meeting and based on communication with one of the meeting organizers we understand that the issues discussed at that include concerns about impacts to big game winter range water rights public safety and loss of agricultural land and rural character so those comments that we understand were discussed at that meeting are similar to what we saw during the noi public comment period i will pause here to see if council has any questions about this project hearing none i will move on the next project update is the nolan hills wind power project despite the name this is a proposed wind and solar pv energy energy generation facility the applicant nolan hills wind llc proposes to develop the 600 megawatt facility within an almost 16 000 acre micro setting corridor in new matilla the proposed facility would be located south of interstate 84 approximately four miles south of echo and 10 miles west of pendleton the external outline on the slide shows the site boundary and the purple shading shows the micrositing corridor which would contain the wind turbine strings access roads collector lines and the internal 6.8 mile 230 kilovolt transmission line the solar and battery storage components are represented by the larger larger solid purple shading area in the northeast portion of the site boundary the facility would interconnect to bpa's transmission system in either one of two ways in both ways are shown on the slide they're seeking permitting options for and the first route is known as the uec cottonwood route usc standing for umitil electric cooperative and that would consist of 8.4 miles of new 230 kilovolt transmission line and modification of almost 17 miles of existing uvc transmission lines the cottonwood route would run west from the northern facility substation to the uec cottonwood substation and then existing lines would deliver the power north to bp's mcnairy substation near the columbia river the second option is known as the bpa stanfield route this would consist of a new overhead four and a half mile 230 kilovolt transmission line and that would run from the northern facility substation to bp's fanfield substation bpa has not yet built the stanfield substation so that's one reason for the two different transmission line options and their request at this time the developer is revising their preliminary application to respond to our request for additional but for those parts of the application where we have sufficient information we've begun drafting the draft proposed does the council have any questions about this project madam chair this is hanley katie how much of the 600 megawatts is solar versus wind do you know um i do and that would be i'll just check in here okay the solar is estimated at approximately 260 megawatts and wind would be about 340 megawatts but they do hope to have the flexibility based on market conditions at that time to modify how much goes to each component is there any battery storage proposed yes um and sorry to not be clear about that so the battery storage components would be located um around where you see the solar component and that is that solid outline in the northeastern corner of the site so the battery storage would either be distributed throughout that area where the solar components are it would be in the northwest portion around where the solar component is but all grouped together and near the northern facility substation do we know the uh capacity of that i can double check on that and get back to you soon okay that's okay i think it's around 100 megawatts yes go ahead cindy this is cindy um thank you um katie just given the um large public input i guess the or engagement this is more about process your process or our process i should say um how do you incorporate so the applicant is responding to questions we're drafting the proposed how are you incorporating the comments that we're getting not particularly on the record but there's a lot of activity how do you take that in um as you're drafting the proposed order sure um thank you councilmember condon and is this a question for nolan hills or bonanza or just generally um generally but given the large public input on this one or interest it seems and partly because i i this is i think one of the first that i'm involved from the beginning i went to the ny so i'm i'm curious in the process for this one particularly that's a great question thank you so um this actually is a good question for all the updates i'm giving today so specifically for al so i'll talk about bonanza first the bonanza energy facility the one that um it's not in an active public comment period but we are receiving a number of questions about that so i'll go back to that one real quick because we don't have an application right now the way that i'm handling it just in terms of a public servant's role of answering questions providing process when we receive a request to pass along comments to the council i will send that to secretary cornett and he'll make sure that we're able to package it so that we're not overwhelming counsel with but at this time in terms of any issues raised by the public because we don't have a application to review yet it's more informative for us and then an opportunity for us to share information about process and then that differs from nolan hills where there have been a few comments that have come in um so i'll move back to that one and um you know i i would have to say in contrast we haven't received as many comments now that doesn't minimize the impact of the comments on nolan hills but i would say comments have been most interested or most concerned about the transmission line routes and so as we were going through reviewing the application and developing a request for additional information the applicant elected to add an",

environmental justice Lauren Rosenstein is leading along with me and um Bland do some natural resources we have Michael FRS and Amy schlusser there are a lot more people at Odo who are informing this project but this is just uh to to familiarize yourself with the names and to hear them uh uttered at least once before we dive in um and with that Deb I'm going to hand it back to you so I think now we're going to do introductions of The Advisory Group folks in the room yep yep great great thank you so Gilly can you take down the slide deck for a sec um well let me first re you it's okay leave it down what he had up on the slide that I told him to take down was name affiliation uh who you're representing here at the table and this um hopes and expectations for the process we're doing about a minute each so this is going to be a bit chunky because there's a lot of faces on the screen I have in front of me what's a close to alphabetical list and I'm actually going to call off a name and ask the person to speak and Gilly can you spotlight as the person speaking I'm not sure if it shows up on my screen that way but it' be a nice way to give the person just a moment in the light if you will for the minute and um and I have a few people that I think might be missing or have some um yeah substitutions in today so we'll we'll just get started and at the end if I missed you then we're going to have people raise their hands and then I'll make sure to catch everybody else okay so first up is Aaron or l eron are you here wave I am here did she get for having an a as a first name okay yeah double a it's a it's a blessing and a curse um my name's Aaron Orlowski I am uh work on the communications team at the Eugene Water and Electric Board so representing eweb uh I handle Communications for our energy Division and all of our media relations um but a little bit about me I spent the first half of my career in journalism um back in the day I actually covered the North Dakota Bach and oil boom and that uh in a small little town there and that kind of kicked off my interest in energy and I've been pursuing it uh really ever since um but I'm excited to represent you know Oregon's thirdd largest publicly or third largest utility the largest publicly owned one um and the interest of our our folks in Eugene My Hope for participating in this process is that we can develop a strategy that is really relevant and understandable for average oregonians but it's not you know something filled with technical gobbley cook that uh no one outside of a no one without an engineering degree can can understand but you know something that average oregonians can really Embrace so uh hopefully we can do that together and I'm looking forward to working with all you thank you Erin and welcome um and I'm going to mention it advance I may mispronounce some of your names so please help me and with a name like noodleman I'm comfortable with it but I'm going to try my best so next up is kryer is Andrea here so Gilly I'm gonna hold a little space in some of if in case some of these folks are coming late will you help me okay and I'll check once more at the end yep okay great for that thank you so next I have Andrew muli Brian Adams oh I'm I'm here sorry was trying to get off mute uh so Brian Adams I'm uh representing the Pacific Propane Gas Association um Association representing the propane industry um obviously within the Pacific Northwest uh also sit on the national Propane Gas Association renewable energy subcommittee and a Ambassador for renewable propane with the propane Education and Research Council um I'm the president CEO of coinery propane a orgon based propane libery uh company that's owned by two Rural Electric co-ops here in Oregon that make up 68,000 um uh members of those uh of those co-ops and I'm really interested uh in participating um to to help kind of shape the the future of the energy complex for for Oregon you know the shift towards decarbonization of the energy complex is um is important and uh something I fully support and just welcome the opportunity to uh to provide my uh my input and um expertise in the in the areas that I come from so looking forward to meeting the group welcome glad to have you with us um we are thinking there might be a few Advisory Group members stuck in the listening mode and can't talk to us so we're hoping that if you're in the audience and you're supposed to be up here with the Advisory Group could you either raise your hand or you you can press star nine both of those will tell our team to help promote you up and get you into The Advisory Group table okay so hoping that might happen for a few of you so that was Brian I have next Kathy Ellie um next charity feain hello everyone I'm charity Fain I'm the executive director at Community energy project or C I use she her pronouns um I'm representing on this committee um environmental justice organizations and concerns um we do um Energy Efficiency and um Renewables and uh really look at um the most impacted by climate change um and for the process I really just um hope that we're all able to um I'm going to try to focus myself on listening um and uh really trying to be open to the process and um just want to see uh what we can co-create together um because I feel like in other conversations no matter what um point of view we're coming from we do all actually care about the communities we live in um and we all do want to see improvements in the world that we're sharing so um even if we don't necessarily all agree on how to get there we all do share that common value of really caring about the communities we're in um so thanks I'm glad to be part of this great great to have you with us thank you um I'm watching a few of the chat comments that folks are letting us know that when they're in listening mode they can't actually raise their hands or hit star n and so I'm not sure if there's a way they can rename on their uh screen so we can figure out if there's anybody else that we need to promote or if there's a way to text or email Gilly maybe yes yeah Deb folks should be able to hit uh star n and raise their hand now all right all right so we've got that fixed good we're still GNA keep moving along thank you uh next I have a Christine Go Lightly hi yes thanks um Christine go whle I'm a policy analyst with the Columbia River intertribal Fish Commission we are a commission of four tribes in the Northwest so um matilla and Warm Springs both in Oregon and I see well Kathy Eli was was swarm Springs I'm not sure if she's on um but I I see you have representatives from both um on The Advisory Group so that's great uh we are a and then the others are nesp and Idaho and yakma in waston Washington and we're a um commission representing the four tribes in their treaty fishing rights in protection of those rights and the salmon that make up those rights um in Spring of 2022 we uh produced a a energy vision for the Columbia River Basin and I can pop that in the chat here when I'm done for people to check out it's a um a vision for our green transition in the Pacific Northwest in a way that is also fish friendly uh we have concerns about too rapid and um un organized uh energy transition will will put the uh the burden on the tribes and on the Fisheries um as it did in the past with the creation of the dams in the first place and so uh I'm here my hope is to just um be able to to relay our energy vision and our recommendations within that into the strategy thank you and welcome so we were just able to promote Kathy is it Ellie Eli yes good morning CL thank you welcome glad you're herec thank you so hi I'm Kathy Eli so I'm the um executive director for Warm Springs Power and Water Enterprises it's a chartered Enterprise for the Warm Springs confederated tribes of Warm Springs and uh our mission is to oversee the tribes interests in the Pelton round but hydroelectric project as who is the tribes are a partner owner with Portland General Electric as well as advanced renewable energy projects on the reservation so I've been in this role for a couple years and uh prior to that I had a long Federal career uh at Bonville power Administration so I've been in the energy industry for um forever and uh the tribe is more recently um uh been quite active in its development of transmission opportunities and was a recipient of the doe grip Grant uh to help uh upgrade the an existing PGE transmission line and the reason I mentioned that is in doing that Grant um which I think we've all probably participated in that eort which is quite a lift but um it became clear to me that the alignment of energy policy you know a clear line of sight from the local to the state to the federal level was really important and we stressed that alignment uh in our application and I'm convinced that that that was helpful in us being successful in that endeavor so my hope in this this effort is to get the tribes um integrated as a course of business in energy policy development and then also um at the front end um such that you know their their um proposals and processes and concerns are considered um early on because they can be quite informative to the process to help it uh in the long run to avoid some obstacles so great to be here thank you thank you and welcome so next up is Scott good morning everybody Cory out with Pacific Power uh as some of you know Pacific Power serves a lot of communities about 243 communities across Oregon Washington Northern California so couple hundred communities in Oregon in kind of a patchwork setting from Northeast part of the State uh",

        "text": "regon trail interpretive centers segments of the oregon trail and the on-the-ground version of the pioneer experience experience walking the trail will be damaged by the proposed b2h utility corridor forever the interpretive center was designed so visitors walking remnants of the oregon trail would see the vast open space to the west as a pioneer saw them if this proposed utility quarter were needed appropriate mitigation is to require idaho power to bury portions of the line that would visually impact the historic oregon trail as well as the view shed in front of nahotec in the cross-examination hearing in january gail garbiner asked idaho powers witness dennis johnson of powers engineers about line burial he said it was definitely feasible he even came up with a better placement for underground where the ends of the line would come up out of the ground in a less visible and less obstructive way that meant the line would be buried for approximately 1.7 miles which as stated above is feasible idaho power claims that bearing the line is more expensive but who is paying for this line anyway yes we the payers it's the least that idle power should do for the people of baker county in the state of oregon who cherish the pioneer history of our historic oregon trail and region the bearing of this 500 kv line is not nearly as expensive as the burial of another 500 kv line in chino hills california which many have testified and brought technical information into this case at chino hills they went under a shopping mall a freeway and an entire neighborhood yet idaho paris says they just can't do it shame on them not only has the public not had access to the information required to decide if the developers will be providing adequate mitigation for the impacts to the historic resources but the council has not received anything but general statements regarding the kinds of mitigation that may be required definitely not adequate to make a decision that the development complies with historic cultural and archaeological standard f-sec f-sec should not allow an out-of-state utility to tear up oregon's history to benefit idaho powers administrators and shareholders please reverse or remand the alj's decision on this issue thank you miss marlon any questions from council okay thank you you're welcome again lisa rachner for the record in their exceptions regarding hca 3 ms gilbert and ms marlette make numerous arguments about idaho power's assessment of impacts to the oregon trail and proposed mitigation methods in three minutes i can't respond to them all but i will respond to their primary arguments and first i just want to emphasis first i want to emphasize that idaho power's analysis of visual impacts to the oregon trail and potential mitigation was detailed and the company performed detailed analyses of both direct and indirect impacts that included extensive database and literature research desktop review and intensive level field surveys of the direct analysis area and the visual impact areas with respect to the company's methodology for assessing visual impacts idaho power crafted an approach in coordination with shippo the blm and odo to properly address f sex standards the company crafted this hybrid methodology because blm's visual impact methods were not necessarily aligned with the definition of significant impacts under f-sect's rules furthermore although not required by the council's rules idaho power also performed a cumulative impact assessment of visual impacts to trail resources similarly idaho power's proposed mitigation measures under f-sects under the f-sec historic properties management plan are sufficiently detailed to allow for public participation and they're reasonable and appropriate under fsx cultural resources standard in particular mitigation regarding the height and color of transmission towers as well as print publication and media for education these are all accepted methods to address visual impacts from transmission and with respect to the proposal the that idaho power underground the line in front of nahotic to eliminate impacts this council has already determined in the wheatridge case that it lacks the jurisdiction to order a an applicant to underground a line the job of fsec is to rule on whether or not the proposed route meets your standards as opposed to some hypothetical route such as undergrounding so regardless on that issue the council lacks jurisdiction to order undergrounding any questions from council councilor condon thank you councilmember connor thanks again for being at the table um a question with respect to the mitigation and the um signage and materials can you speak a little bit more about how that is a satisfies the mitigation to the site issue certainly so first of all i mean the rule of mitigation is to avoid um and so um if the company can't avoid any impact at all on the visual side then the next then it will first consider the approaches that are very specific to the visual impact and so the tools in the company's tool kit have to do with non-reflective surfaces of the um of the transmission towers themselves micrositing to avoiding skylining or you know to move them slightly to reduce that impact and also lowering tower heights so it does have a number of tools in its tool kit to try to reduce visual impacts the other um you know the other kind of runners up i would say such as educational materials those you're right those don't directly reduce a visual impact but they do provide other benefits to the trail educational materials signage all of mitigation approaches they're designed to enhance to overall enhance the perception and experience of the trail which is i think in the end overall what we're trying to do is reduce the impact and enhance the viewers experience of the trail any other questions from council okay thank you miss rachner council row scroll department of justice on behalf of the oregon department of energy uh first i'd like to address a couple of comments that ms gilbert made in her testimony uh she suggested that council would be waiving statutes i'm not certain what statute or rules she might have in mind but the point of this exercise is to establish whether or not the applicant has complied with the historic and cultural resources standard the department is recommending that the council find that they have met that standard not recommending that council waive that standard recommending that the applicant meets it in one of the ways that they'll meet it is through preparation of the historic properties management plan ms gilbert suggested that that condition would not require department of approval that's not accurate we've already reviewed that condition once but i'll point it out to you again that is on page 506 of the proposed it's recommended historic cultural and archaeological resources condition 2. very first paragraph says that the plan has to be prepared submitted to the department submitted to shippo applicable tribal governments vote for review and department approval end quote so it will be submitted to reviewing agencies the department will consult with them and must be subject to the department's approval this a common theme has been concerns expressed about council delegating future review and approval of plans to the department that is expressly allowed in statute legislature has authorized this council to do just that in ors 469 402 delegation of review of future action required by site certificate i'm just going to read this but again the statute is 469 402 if the energy facility citing council elects to impose conditions on a site certificate or an amended site that requires subsequent review and approval of a future action the council may delegate the future review and approval to the state department of energy if in the council's discretion the delegation is warranted under the circumstances of the case it's short on time uh in short we agree with the alj's ruling in the department's response to these exceptions it did recommend uh of the proposed contested case order to include additional facts on the record again that is in our written response those facts relate to the ongoing pre-construction role that third party entities would have in reviewing the hpmp including the oregon historic trails association and the oregon historic trails advisory council so recognizing that my time is out again we're recommending that you supplement the pcco and any one of you could uh take a quick look at our written response and include that in a straw this is handling patrick where is that at it's in your response to the exception or page 4 of our response exceptions on hca3 so it's it's fact 68 after that i want to check something else here a little bit if i have a question i would note one scrivener's error in on page four we refer to the oregon trails association with the acronym octa that should read oregon california trails association with the acronym octa any other questions from council cindy conan for the record um mr rowe can you please read that last phrase on the statute that you just read or the last sentence of the six months again it's ors 469 402 uh the council may delegate the future review and approval to the state department of energy if in the council's discretion the delegation is warranted under the circumstances of the case so my question is could you give an of circumstances that wouldn't allow for that for delegation i would say in a general not an example but conceptually a general reason not to would be if all the information is presently available to the applicant that there's no reason to and and wait for future analysis or department approval if they have everything they need right now and can conduct the analysis waiting until after issuance of the site certificate that would be a reason not and i i think i'm specifically back to the approval um because we the council would be delegating approval to the department as well and the circumstances of that were just an example that we we couldn't do that so do you mean that you would wait for future analysis to be done but rather than delegate approval to the department you retain the authority yes i think that would be at your discretion if you think the issue is such that you want to revisit it and you want to be the the approving body then that would be at your discretion to do that okay thank you for the record this is perry chalk tube i just like to let you know that um how it actually works is um you have an archaeologist do a study and find cultural resources and which are basically non-renewable once they're destroyed they're destroyed they're put on record and they're put on the register on the federal cultural resources will not stop a project um they basically file for a permit through shippo and they figure the the site has been captured towards being recorded so it still can be impacted",

        "text": " 2023. um in order to make a formal ask to Metro a city must have a concept plan not for the LOI specifically but when we get further down the road next year we have to have a a the city has to have a concept plan completed to make the ass that's new this year or this cycle Sherwood has an accepted concept plan Sherwood West and we might share a little bit more about that um the Sherwood city council has accepted the plan but we haven't yet decided on whether or not we will actually make an ass to Metro and so we um two different work sessions planned this fall to discuss that with the council and that's where the decision making will occur on whether or not we make an ask and if we do how much of Sherwood West we will actually ask for uh but the first sort of indication of our intentions will be in this December uh Loi June 2024 will do uh Metro will release the draft report in fall of 2024 public hearings by the metro Council and then in Winter of 2024 um actual decision making by the metro councils that's high level timeline and just really briefly and some of you may know this but what's actually in the at the highest level there's going to be growth forecasts for population and employment that gets reconciled with the buildable lens inventories for both housing and employment and that determines whether or not we have enough existing Supply within the urban growth there's more to it than that things that are are germane to this discussion in the 2018 report during the last cycle there was a regional industrial site Readiness inventory that was an appendix to the urban growth report I'm not sure if that's going to be included this cycle but we hope so we hope that inventory is updated so we get a picture of industrial land Supply within the the the second one is really what you're going to hear from us and what we what we hope is included this this cycle as well which is an assessment of the potential economic benefits of any proposed ugb expansion for employment uses so not just looking at supply and demand but also you know uh what are the the regions or that specific City's aspirations and what are the economic benefits of that ugb expansion again for employment land specifically um and then um also for this discussion they'll be looking at potential office to residential conversions as well um and then just wanted to highlight a few different or a few quotes from the 2018 report and this is really our our takeaway today um during this presentation and it talks about you know basically the process for employment land not for residential that's kind of separate in this discussion but for employment and determining the the supply and demand and I'm just going to read them because I think they're really good quotes the first one is it is challenging to estimate land needs based on an employment forecasts this difficulty is Amplified by the additional uncertainty surrounding employment forecast since job growth can be influenced For Better or For Worse by international relations monetary policy and many other factors that that lie outside the control of cities counties regions or the state um and I think we saw a really good example of that with the chips act being passed at the federal level and then the county or sorry the state passing sort of a complementary you know Bill and you you know that that happened I don't think the city of Sherwood you know saw that coming a few years ago I don't know that the county saw that coming a few years ago or even the state but it happened we want to be able to take advantage of those opportunities that are outside of our control um and then the second quote is for these reasons determining industrial land needs is best understood as an exercise in Economic Development Goal setting rather than forecasting this is true at the regional level and even more so at the local level and that's kind of our takeaway and our discussion questions for you is you know what are our Economic Development goals around industrial around employment and traded sector and and what type of industrial land needs you know does does that does that call for and I'll turn it over to Bruce Bruce who's going to talk a little bit more about um this this report in our region great thanks thanks Eric good afternoon really my topic is going to be to talk about the urban growth report and the urban growth a boundary expansion process and why that's important for the economic viability and prosperity of Washington County I think everybody knows that Washington county is one of the key Economic Development drivers of both the state and the region and we all know about the importance of manufacturing to the west side and the County's economy and and you know for example uh even though there are a few cities particularly in the northern part of the county that are thought of primarily as the Silicon Forest really all of the cities in Washington County have technology manufacturing uh Industries and we have one of the the strongest semiconductor supply chain uh clusters in in the United States we also have a very strong technical Workforce however a lot of that Workforce is starting to retire and so we really need to be getting ready for the next generation of Workforce and I think that will build and retain the middle class for this County and I think that's all consistent with with the 2018 Urban growth report which talks about manufacturing as the background as the backbone I'm sorry to the Metro economy because traded sector jobs really create higher paying family wage jobs in about 42 percent of the uh of uh uh 42 more than than average jobs are paying which is of course really important in income tax producing state so really trade a sector employment is is what creates the opportunity for diversity and equity and economic Mobility because the barrier for entry really doesn't necessarily require a high school diploma or even a college degree we're asking for a market-driven approach uh to the urban growth report and to the urban growth boundary expansion and we think it has to be an aspirational approach to economic development in this entire process process in order to grow industrial land and and then trade a sector jobs and that I think really requires is an ongoing and early engagement process that should include not only the cities and the county but industrial real estate experts and the private sector and site selectors and other stakeholder groups you know for example such as neop and Oregon business and industry and and the semiconductor Association of Oregon and a lot of other a lot of other important players in in this process we're going to talk now about corporate site selectors and their perception of greater Portland as a place to locate business and here I'm going to turn over uh the presentation to Joe Miles I think many of you know her she has over 20 years of experience as senior business recruitment manager for the state she's now retired she worked extensively with site selectors and she's now with Gorilla strategic Partners a site selector in Atlanta so Jill it's all yours great thanks just to make sure that everybody can hear me all right okay thank you so much so I'm only going to touch on some some key things that I've learned as the the business organs recruitment leader um but let's just kind of take just a quick step back and and I really first of all that Sherwood is taking such a aggressive stance in trying to set their own destiny and when it comes to Industrial land I am I didn't get a chance to say that the other day but I I want to applaud you guys for being proactive and looking at opportunities because if somebody's been with the state of Oregon for over 27 years building out Urban growth boundaries and setting supply for industrial lands is is very important and I think covet kind of you know kicked us a little bit so everybody's kind of in my opinion playing catch-up and Sherwood is taking a very aggressive and proactive stance and so for that Bruce you and your team I I wanna I wanna applaud you guys for that but let's talk about some of the pros that we've got going here in Oregon as somebody who has represented the state as long as I have Workforce for Oregon is Undisputed everybody knows we have an amazing Workforce it starts with just the quality of what we have in our Metals manufacturing our traded sector manufacturing such as Timber food and beverage but also with our semiconductor and r d as well as bioscience which has become one of the key industries that business Oregon has taken on so when I represented Oregon I never had to sit there and and tout how great our Workforce is it was pretty much prevalent okay um same thing in terms of Pros is Oregon's Transportation advantages are pretty strong even though we're a small stage if you think about it in terms of population we're a large state in terms of geography but what we do is we do know how to move Commerce and we know how to move it well whether it's with our our short lines with our Mainline railroads with our 23 ports our interstate system and most people don't realize we have three interstates 82 84 and i5 and then 405 and 205 as well as 105 down in Eugene are part of the I-5 Corridor so we we have that and Highway 97 is also a main transportation Corridor for Oregon so we move product well and we have all those mechanisms in place the other thing even though I think it's kind of getting a little bit challenging is we still have affordable housing when you look at Seattle British Columbia the San Francisco um Bay Area all the way down into LA and San Diego so if you look at the West Coast we're still affordable whether it's the Portland region or not so those are what are some of the things that I would do when I was representing Oregon as a recruitment officer I would talk about these things and I would highlight PSU and Portland Community College in Mount Hood Community College in Oregon Tech I would represent all of um talking about the advantages now here's going to be the hard part for you I I use cons instead of negatives because I think that's a better word but Bruce knows as well as other economic developers whether they're with GPI or the City of Hillsboro we we have we are what I consider kind of been a land you guys are taking it and you're running with it which you're going to set a precedent so that everybody else can kind of learn through what the city of Sherwood is going through I can tell you right now before I left and I left business Oregon on on June",

        "text": " notes I'm so sorry um the this is what's the exciting work that's underway in Washington um and we're not doing it alone Washington County may be at the helm of this work but we are not alone here we have the voters with us um we have leaders at every level of uh government working to support our work and um and we have our partners at the state legislature um who made gamechanging investment in the last legislative session with more than $1 billion dollar invested into housing um Solutions still to come so one of these Fierce Partners uh in the work uh champions of housing is the wonderful uh Senator Casey Jama I first met senator jamama in his former role uh launching as the co-founder of the center for in Intercultural organizing which is now um a beloved organization we all know as unite organ uh while at unite Oregon Senator Jama LED Community organizing campaigns to reduce the influence of money in politics and police profiling reform organs hate crime laws and expand drug treatment and advocate of course for affordable housing and stability too and that's where we met on the First on Oregon's first ballot measure campaign for affordable housing uh Senator Jama you are a Beloved Community organizer a fierce defender of our work in equity I think the father of twin teenagers I don't know how you do it um and you're currently serving as our chair of the Senate um committee on Housing and Development um where we continue to rely and partner with you um uh rely on your Visionary leadership for Housing Solutions in the state so it's a tremendous honor to have you with us this morning um um I'll turn the floor over to you Senator Casey jaman well good morning good morning I am really grateful to be with you all today uh again as chess said my name is Senator Casey Chama I am the chair of the organ Housing State Senate housing committee uh and development um I'm going to start a little bit why housing is important issue for me um I usually this share this with folks but you know I grew up as a nomad kid in Eastern Africa uh and the house that I used to leave you know was made my mom is one one room and when I the civil war broke and I left in Somalia and I came join this community about 24 years ago I didn't anybody I had one person's phone call phone number and I called that person who was another follow Somali Refugee um and he pretty much allow me to coach Ser coach Ser for about few months until I was able to stand on my own feed uh and I was able to secure housing and you when you have a refuge experience it changes you and it will allow you to have a different perspective in the world um and uh both my professional level and my personal experience is what really brings me this conversation today and I hope folks will give me a signal if I speaking too much because I tended not to I tend to speak too much uh but in in hindsight um that's what really what drives me for passion I have end up as a refugee and not able to have a place to call home and that really impacted me and my history is not alone it's shared by many many other refugees uh and immigrants across the country Andross this beautiful state of Oregon um so when I joined the Senate um three years ago um I become the chair of the housing committee and the Senate but this work is not one person's job it really it's about collaboration um and so it it's a team effort and that's what the message one of the messages today I want to share with you despite what you see in the news we work together we really work together whether you're Republican or Democrat both Chambers made a priority on housing and both parties make housing priorities housing should not be a partisan issue and I think both leaders in the Democratic party as well as as the Republican folks also make that commitment that housing is going to be a bipartisan issue uh that we all have to work together so I'm really grateful to have my colleague Senator uh uh Nick Anderson who is the vice chair of the housing committee from Lincoln uh him and I really work together closely uh I also really appreciate and collaborate with my houseing counterparty representative Maxine dxer uh I'm really grateful her leadership she really really aspires to hold us higher standard and push us as much as she can to make sure that we serve Oregon the best that we can uh as her as chair of the housing house committee um I also want to share with you this uh um the count local counties and particularly Washington County has been tremendously partner for us we rely on your staff your team you are all Frontline workers you understand your community you have the ability to translate what you see on the community needs into real action and call and call us but we also depend on you to testify to share us your perspectives so I have a really great pleasure working with the Washington County Housing team uh greatly and I think right now you have new addition uh someone that I really admire and I really appreciate her work when she was organ housing community services Nicole who is also wealth of knowledge around State uh issues and state funding and state capacity uh so I'm really excited that you're joining Washington County team um I'm also grateful also the um County Commissioners and cine Harrison Council chair Harrison who is really I met her we Shar sharing really earlier today we Mar met her about I think so decade or so ago when I was the executive director of of United Oregon and we were able to and she was the Metro counselor and we were able to collaborate and partner with us uh with that sense and I'm grateful for her leadership as well the I want to frame this conversation ways housing as I said earlier it is effort of collective effort and that the way we should be approaching that has been the way we approaching as legisl but for our office particularly we created four area framework that we we used to to do the work and I want to share with you a little bit about that framework uh today the first how we feel housing is that number one we want to make sure we keep people their homes so they don't end up an addition to the Housing houseless Community that we're facing in see in streets what that means for us is that creating a policies that are helping people to be Care Homes such as Senate Bill 611 that Senator Kos and I and other folks and CH lexer work together collectively to ensure that we some we C the rent to 10% uh we also did a lot of other um um eviction preventions funding um large resources that we allocated for the during the uh 2023 session just give you an example since I was the Senate three years ago the state invested over $4 billion in including dollars from arba dollars as well as state funding dollars that is a lot of money but we the needs greater than resource that is available for us so it's a Brent that we have to figure out ways to collaborate and work together so that's number one for us how do we keep people their homes meaning make sure we we we prevent affections we make sure that we fund rental assistance programs last session we invested about $100 million on the rental assistance programs uh across the board and Washington County received the resource as well so I am really grateful that we're able to do that the second framework that point that we use in our office for addressing homelessness and housing issue is that when people come homeless and they come end up in our streets how do we deal with it how do we give them and support that they needed for permanent housing and those particularly also the those who are struggling with mental health and addiction and substance abuse that we are able to provide resources by making sure that we have enough shelter of course we never had enough shelter this so the issue is not that we have enough we need to do more we need to build but that's we have a lot of work has been done we collaborated with the governor's office uh while we put it in HP 2001 where we invested over $200 million on both continuing shelters and support but also adding more beeds into the system um so that's another area that our office has how we see the third area that we I want our office really frame as part of the housing conversation is about home ownership I'll tell you this at refugi my trajectory of my family has not changed until we were able to own our own homes that's where our chure is as a family and you know how we did it we did it because there was support for us in terms of the down payment assistance in terms of how handholding because I I I thought I was fully educated around housing and I I assumed housing was I I cannot attain housing that was how I fused my family until somebody tell us no you actually let me let me walk through you the process so creating educational programs making sure that we provide rental uh down payment assistance is going to be key and last session we allocated $7.5 million on Housing Home Ownership but we need to do more we need to continous to particularly buy back and imiges low income orians who actually need that kind of support and so if we want to build a wealth and change the trajectory of our community we want to make sure that folks who are need to own homes and have the ability to own homes and we will be able to provide particularly those folks who are in the by back Community next day but we need to increase housing production and I think there was quite significant housing new housing opportunities affordable housing that has been recently built in Washington County and we need continues to invest affordable housing as well as Market trade housing both of them so folks can help uh access to housing uh no matter their income level is uh so those are the four area framework if we are able to do those four area I think we can make a then on the housing the other comment that I want to mention before I stop is that I don't see housing issue as a issue housing is intersectional you all know that you on the front lines to folks in this room today you can interact with somebody who is house houseless because they have mental health issues or because they have substance abuse issues on the track addiction you can have we have to provide rap around services to ensure folks that they have the ability to recover and ability to gain housing",

        "text": " is there we need to work on the western resource adequacy and make that a success what we learn from these programs will help form the base and that's where my and i don't want to take away the future discussion now but that's where i was heading when i made the comment and incrementalization all of these are great point of resource renewable interconnections and access to renewables in the system they're all great point transmission complexities surrounding it all great points but doing it in incremental approach gets you to a more success than trying to jump into an rto because i don't think any of this conversation has shown that there's a absolutely a remarkable 180 degree turnaround benefit of an rto versus what we have today so i'll leave it at that for for for the next conversation okay thank you robbie for that teaser uh mary thank you so i was going to make a comment i think kind of similar to what robbie the point ravi was making in terms of the problems that we're solving by or or by joining an rto or or kind of what an rto can do in terms of solving problems that we currently have and and that's i think it's really important to distinguish what kind of what we're solving for with an rto versus um what can be solved for separately from an rto or what types of problems kind of regardless of whether an rto exists i think in the transmission conversation you know we're talking about fighting um that's an example uh and and i think things like um you know thinking sort of about how and why corporate buyers site in particular regions i think is really varied and has a lot of different variables as robbie notes we've had a lot of data centers site here primarily due to the low cost of energy and so it just strikes me that you're thinking through you know a utility kind of moving forward with the decision to to join rto structure or not really kind of looking at the costs and benefits of that move you know you know in terms of kind of affordability and reliability at the same time so i i think from my the real benefit of an rto from a renewables perspective is really in that kind of core function of of integrating more seamlessly across a broader and i know we're getting this into the into the next we'll get into this in the next question but then i think that does create a lot of tension in terms of some of these individual state policies and making sure that you know the the those individual state policies are still reflected even while you are able to get that benefit through the rto of you know increased integration and and avoiding companies thank you mary see some hand still raised i don't know if these were uh in response to something that was said or if these are from earlier spencer i still your hand is raised uh thanks adam i was just going to respond briefly to robbie's comments and i guess clarify at least for my comments if it wasn't clear earlier the problem that nipsey's identified is not that the can't or hasn't had development of new renewables on the existing grid it's can we do it better and where do we go from here now that a lot of the existing renewable resource particularly the wind in the columbia river gorge has been tapped how are we going to bring on offshore wind in oregon how are we going to integrate more wind in montana and wyoming solar and central oregon and everything in between and so i don't want the group here to walk away with the impression that um renewables developers and ipps don't think the system works at all here it does work to a degree but um the notion that um we should just keep on trucking the way we're doing it i think misses the possibility of doing things better and for what it's worth the members of nipsey are customer facing they are talking to large corporations who are trying to build out their renewable resource portfolio and it's harder to do it in the northwest than other regions the power can be cheaper in general that's a good resource we have in the region including an organ but the transaction costs the integration costs the pancaking of transmission rates and the complexity of the tariffs at a creates barriers to building out this part of the market in the northwest that we hear from corporate procures like the the large tech firms of the world who have an easier time building things in rtos like pgm or spp so i just wanted to add that thanks for that feedback do we have any other comments or questions on this topic um happy to keep the floor open otherwise i was going to suggest we more or less stick with our our agenda in terms of when we take a break it's just a 10-minute break but happy to uh i see ravi's ravi's hand back up so turn over to ravi i'll make it a 10th second come on thank you spencer for the clarification appreciate it um you can see my picture but i was nodding what you were saying but one question i do want you guys to think don't have to answer it is does an rto suddenly solve access to transmission uh from coastal area uh renewable development i mean do the challenges get easier to address or the challenges stay the same and you don't need to answer but think about it maybe we'll get that to the at the end of the overall discussion but something to think about any quick feedback to that uh question from robbie okay uh from the just travis very ibw again so i do believe that they're the same i i don't believe that rto formation creates any uh easier pathway to integrate offshore wind into the system than the current system we have right now most of the transmission uh things that stand in the way of the transmission right ways or transmission being built are the public process uh scenarios and and rto is not going to remove any of from the process that we have at hand so i i do have concern on rto coming in you could have difference in pricing which could lead the the owners of the transmission systems whether that's bonneville power administration or the private utilities that operate transmission to where they don't invest the same as they do right now which could lead to a transmission system that is degraded in the way that it's operated so i i do have that still overarching concern that i haven't heard answers to um that i'm still uh still listening to see where there's options that could benefit us because i am in favor of expanding our renewables i'm in favor of uh building transmission lines um but i'm in favor of doing it in a way that we continue to have the proper investments in our systems thank you travis and uh real estate robbie has a response no and i'd like to respond to ravi's question first before we go back to him renewable northwest and nipsey actually represent offshore wind developers and i think the value proposition that our members see in this is that right now the capital costs and infrastructure costs getting an offshore wind economy built in oregon are insurmountable for one utility so having an rto actually will allow a project built off the oregon coast to sell too many you to sell to many customers in the region and i think that's that's a real a real issue i i think the reason that they are so involved in this conversation is that they see a huge hurdle to getting their projects to market without some sort of a regional solution i would defer to the developers of these resources on their expertise here organizations that don't have experience integrating any offshore wind into the system so i just wanted to point that out thanks nicole uh ravi did you have a follow-up comment uh adam i i just want to i know i'm between the break uh and then and these comments and this discussion but great conversation thank you travis thank you nicole um i just want to make one point and that is i don't want the committee to think here bonifa or ravi are opposed or for rto we're we're just trying to provide you know a rational thinking that should be considered from our standpoint about the pros and cons and it nowhere reflects that you know we are either strong supporters or strong composers right now we're neutral we believe in renewable development we believe in transmission expansion we have been doing that i do that as part of my job 365 days and i've been doing it for decades now so our our ultimate goal from my side from a transmission site is to ensure that we are situated to deliver and help both oregon and washington within our footprint to be able to meet their 100 person clean power plant goals identified in the in the law i think oregon is about 2040 and washington is by 2045 and and and work with our other states and our through an inter-regional process to ensure that we uh allow customers in both the states we access to you know other sort of resources renewables from out of state so i just wanted to make that as a general comment because some sometimes i may come across that you know you're always coming across as an anti-rto because every time i'm pulling that card out i'm not all i'm saying is when making a decision or when you're putting this paper in front of the decision makers or whether oregon should consider having a move towards an rto make sure that we are highlighting both the sides so that so that the decision is made in a more holistic manner it aggresses both the sides and the ones that are challenges are then addressed according to the challenges that are that are already benefit there they'll find the benefits to to move forward in the decision making so that's really what my comment was going to be and thank you thank you and appreciate everyone being patient with some of my comments i appreciate the the dialogue on this on this topic so what i'm hearing is that you know there are certainly an rto would take offshore wind as the example there are new opportunities as nicole mentioned sort of with a regional uh demand and potential new investment but some of the challenges still remain in terms of need to reinforce and upgrade transmission and their sighting and permitting challenges and uh those challenges don't go away um even though there's this new opportunity and potential new investment not that they can't be overcome but they're still real i'll leave a moment here if there are any other questions or feedback on this general topic otherwise i will suggest we take",

        "text": " the the economic driver for the the Tri-Cities and there was a huge concern about you know if the work of Andrew goes away what are we going to do as a community is it going to be one of those last person living in the dresses turn off the light uh kind of situation and there was then and there was that really work very real concern I mean and even in the letter there I I have a copy of it and I was referencing Workforce retraining programs like forever second or third year so we would probably be coached a little bit but but but even fast forward almost 10 years past that when my my first girlfriend's in junior high school she had to leave town because her dad got laid off from Hanford and there was no work for it in the Tri-Cities and so it's it's certainly in the not that distant future that they're distant past that we've really had this concern about the long-term and stable stability and growth of the economy and and that's not done away I mean although the community has grown the businesses have become more Diversified between Hanford and pnl but still about 25 of the income it comes into the Tri-City area about 12 13 of the workforce and so they're very significant economic drivers for the for the community and so and Brian shared the the comprehensive land use plan and I think there's uh from the president Community perspective I think there's a lot of interest in especially in the areas that are kind of in designated for preservation and Recreation to work with all the especially with the tribes and with the stakeholder community and with the agencies to really maximize kind of the use of that area for whatever the the highest priority is and we're not really thinking about major economic development but it's that preservation understanding the history and the um and to the extent where it's possible certainly really value the prospect of being able to make it available for tribal people to get back out there and do the things that they've done historically um but a lot of work will focused more on the economic development side is in that area in the Southeast portion of the Hanford site that is in white in the comprehensive land use plan map and that's the area that's identified for industrial use and I'm not sure if you're gonna bring that up or not again um but and I don't know exactly what the what the total 98 groups there is I'm guessing maybe 10 000-ish speaker or something like that maybe a little bit um but that's where we really kind of see where there's a real opportunity most of that land was not uh ever contaminated if not all of it was not ever contaminated um it's fairly close to town close to interjer Northwest which operates the only commercial nuclear reactor in the Pacific Northwest it's pretty close to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory it's also now part of land that was the first kind of Trance of land that was transferred from doe to the tud through the fya 15 National Defense authorization act or ndaa and so that was the first uh transferred to tridec is that we reuse the organization and then we transferred it to energy Northwest for about 300 of those acres and then the other 1300 Acres went to the city of Richmond and the port of Benton and so if you were to zoom in actually I'm sure if you can see this I think so but uh anyway that kind of white area in the in the where the patrol boxes that's been the industrial use area that we have in mind and so exactly yeah thinking right so the energy Northwest up there foreign and so about 1600 of those Acres have already been transferred again uh and we are hopeful that we'll be able to turn that area into sort of a clean energy industrial Hub where we can do all things energy related whether it's research and development uh manufacturing supply chain also demonstrations and deployment of kind of first of a kind or new Innovative Technologies I think we have a lot of advantages the fact that we're so close to the river the fact that we have a fairly robust electrical infrastructure certainly to improve on that zone um but we also have the expertise and we have a very deep encouragement and energy related work in the Tri-City um and so one of the first hopeful tenants that we'll have in that companies what will be the first of its kind green fertilizer or clean fertilizer manufacturer they're a company that's based out of Norway but they have decided that this little corner of former hampered sizes are placed to open up their first clean fertilizer manufacturing soil to take they'll take water and clean energy to make ammonia and uh nitrates and have Nitric fertilizer whipped support lead student working in Washington in a clean non-carbon emitting fertilizer that's actually better than the urea based fertilizer that most of them use now a lot of folks don't know it but fertilizer production globally the global carbon emissions so if we can kind of deploy some of these new technologies like that or so many other different opportunities uh and Necessities in Washington State uh be seen as a global leader in some of this uh clean energy technology development deployment uh we think that would that would be a good world that both contribute to kind of the future where we know we go as a country in this world to reduce carbon emissions but also to continue to drive the economy in an area that's not in a non-federal funding on an annual basis I think there's a video too that I sent over if we can get the technology to um this video was actually done by important Partners at the Port of Benton and I'll preface it it kind of lays out the vision and we've been able to have some very preliminary conversations with some of the archival partners Dr Phil rigged in from the accommodation um have had some conversations with the Umatilla Tribe as well but we need to have more conversations with them uh we've had very very preliminary conversations with doe but my point in saying that is that this isn't sort of something that we're actively pursuing right now but this is just kind of more of the vision for where we'd like to go and but I think it does do a really good job of describing that direction so if the technology works we'll go ahead and show the video I've practiced this last night I called someone in a different should work with volume even so yep that's true it's true the volume I'll open up the chat just in case people start getting angry I can catch them in and where's my vlog hold on yeah so the message is saying it is able to help okay disabled first so audio devices use computer audio right there where it says video change that to the computer on game so sorry let's try this I don't think it's speakers will work with books online see the owl was something I couldn't test last night so they're here for someone yeah they might be able to hear it online but we can't people on the chat with Eric oh okay the experience thank you I think that that's where I can stop for now okay very cool that is that is uh that is very neat thank you um and I I got word that Kermit uh is online now so oh he was having audio we cannot unmute anybody so Kermit you're muted now if if you're trying to talk we can't hear you because you're um and we're not we're not able to unmute anybody you have to unmute yourself there you go you're unmuted um can you hear me at all oh because I I can just barely hear anything that anybody's saying so I'm not sure if anybody can hear me maybe somebody raised your hand if you can hear my voice oh okay all right well let me uh um let me get dialed in so I'll so I'll have the audio from that side just give me just just one second welcome to the audio conferencing Center please enter a conference ID followed by if you're the meeting organizer press star now you are now joining the meeting okay let's see now thank you okay I got a little bit of echoic on my end but uh okay I took it off speaker and hopefully that'll make the difference well I tell you what if um somebody could just kind of give me a lead in I can get started we're about to hear what you hear what you have to say about the bishop perform post without Hanford okay well I'll uh just go ahead and and I'm still having a little bit of trouble hearing from my end but I'll just go ahead and go into uh the the remarks that that I bring and don't really have anything prepared but you know the uh the description just talked about you know the idea of you know what division um for for the Hanford site was um in in the future and this is something that you know the Nez Perce tribe has um been working on you know we've been involved pretty much since the beginning um of of the cleanup or at least the transition so a little over um a little over 30 years um and I guess just really to cut to the chase I think that our overall Vision uh you know for that site um what the Nez Perce tribal executive committee termed their end state vision um is for um you know the site to be returned to you know pre-hand for types of um you know so that you know obviously is is is way out on the horizon um you know so in the meantime you know I think that you know the the other overall goal you know in the meantime is to achieve you know some form of of coal management you know or or to you know play a strong role um in trying to make sure um that you know the planning and all of the activities you know that take place on the site you know that they are all intended you know to point us towards you know that that end-state Vision um and you know personally you know in my role in this you know as a long-term um you know we've got to look at a lot of different issues here um and essentially you know um just trying to divide uh um try to trying to divide the planning process up into into uh segments um you know so we can understand um you know I understand the basic you know uh approach you know to the site um you know so anyway I guess overall you know the utilization is we see it um you know it's going to fall into a few different categories um you know the first one um would be immediate use",

        "text": " for both beginning and completing construction of the kardi solar farm component by three years existing site certificate had the construction to begin on or before february 4th and the rfa was filed february 3rd they're asking to extend it another three years out to 2025 as a result moved the completion deadline out an additional three years as well to 2028 there were no physical alterations being proposed in this rfa to the approved facility cardi solar farm was approved in rfa-1 and they requested and the department evaluated and approved a type b amendment review which basically means while there is public comment there was no opportunity for contesting case so just specifically for the science certificate the proposed changes fall under the general administrative conditions in the site certificate 4.1 and 4.2 supports two in both and this is the strikethrough in the site certificate language of what what it is they're proposing to change also if not someone has any questions one way to interrupt me so very briefly just to review the procedural history on february 3rd the certificate holder filed the preliminary request for amendment 3. the complete rfa was received in june 10 this year along with the department's tight knee determination which we issued on the 17th we also issued the draft the first order as a type b on the 17th of june that opened us up for a comment period 26 days and we issued the proposed order on july and we are at the council review of the proposed order then highlighting that and based upon the outcome of this review we will move on to the final order and amended site certificate as so i wanted to go over very quickly um the comments that we did receive we received reviewing agency comments only we didn't receive general public comments on either the request for amendment 3 or the draft proposed order for requests for amendment 3 the received comments from morrill county best special advisory group oregon department of environmental quality and oregon's department of fish and wildlife just for council's reference these are in attachment two of the staff report uh comments for the preliminary one and comments for the dpo or b2 so in general morrow county asked that site certificate conditions in rfa-3 remain applicable from previous site certificate conditions specific to the county road use and any required land use permits to the county so basically their comment was they just wanted to reaffirm that the existing site conditions would be still applicable and they are oregon deq and submitted comments that they had no relevant to rfa-3 that they would comment on odsw consultation between us and odfw and the certificate and odfw has been ongoing and they basically commented that they wanted to make sure that there was there were no changes on existing conditions and also that they felt based upon the preliminary rfa-3 there was no need for additional surveys or review based upon what was being disposed since that the site area has been extensively surveyed and they have a pretty good idea of what's going on out there wildlife-wise and there's some pre-construction survey requirements that are still applicable on the site certificate so on the draft proposed order which we and kate let's see yeah uh this is varsity just for uh he's my you know we do these um i i appreciate the definer um but i think for me i think you know three years didn't used to feel like a long time but now it's a long time and we've all ever been from our own county and it is continuing to boom and it's a little bit um it's hard to say like three years it's fine and keep kicking it down the road so i'm just if they're fine they're over there they're doing the thing i guess i probably shouldn't have a lot to say but it is seemingly concerning to think that we just do these extensions and and it feels like a safe desk i just wanted to say that then every time i drive more county i'm building some additional things are building i know barry told us that a lot of that was one of his challenges so i think for us to me personally i'm going to continue to be mindful of that growth as we look at all the things that we hear about the road is the you know they have public safety and bias so just uh just a no i appreciate that your ground and just to clarify because this was a general reopener we did re initiate cons consultation coordination with all of our reviewing agencies so we did ask them to put new eyes on this as far as the review um i will say with odfw they're so involved in the ongoing reporting and surveys and and the habitat analysis that's being done that they often are very aware of what's going on in these project areas um as far as their concerns comments we'll receive so the comments on the draft proposed again odfw reviewed what was in the draft proposed order had no comments or concerns or a need for any new or additional requirements for visual online um the certificate holder did provide us with some editorial comments and kind of corrective edits and i'll talk more about this later but public the comment period closed until it well we did receive a late comment from od av oregon department of aviation and um there was an ongoing conversation that i will get to in public services over and potential requests for an amended condition it's a little complicated but i'll get there when we get to the public services as part of our review um we did go back and look at all the analysis that was submitted particularly for request for amendment one which was approved in 2018 and relied on analysis and studies and reports that included the cardi solar farm then go back to like 2016 2017 so these are fairly recent um analyses that were completed and evaluated by the department as part of rf81 under rfa 3 because it is a general reopener we reviewed all of those past analyses and incorporated them into our updated dpo in proposed order so that we could make a determination of whether or not there were any changes in fact or law that might change council's previous for hardy solar bar on rfa-1 and we are recommending that council find that rfa one and two and three and the associated record of those do provide a preponderance of evidence that the certificate holder has demonstrated they can satisfy all cancers applicable council standards and rfa 3 was requested on behalf of the app or the certificate holder primarily because of the changes in the abortment coal plant the desire to time the construction and the bidding process of the rfps for the building of party solar farm and in rfa-3 the certificate holder has indicated that their bidding schedule would not allow them to put this project out too big for construction until 2024 and that's based upon the schedule for decommissioning the boardman call that shared infrastructure that was approved and so that was the basis of their request for cindy conan kate um presidents are wrong but wasn't the decommissioning of boardman whole plan sooner than expected it is i believe ongoing i don't believe it's complete and that it's supposed to be complete within this calendar year and so has it been taken longer than expected when our thing went into i'm just curious about that when r31 and two were approved i guess i thought that it closed down just mentioned earlier sort of it's kind of it just seems like they have more time uh the record talking i'm not sure i have all these correct so sort of caveat with that um but you know there was the attempt with the boardman coal plant to um use terrified violence so there was some evaluation of whether they could do full um and replace the coal burning with that terrified biomass burning so i think at that time they weren't sure if they were actually going to decommission the facility or not so i think that was still around that 2018 that it was still on potentially on the table that they wouldn't actually decommission commission the facility they would just transfer it to a different type of source material to burn um so i think there was still a lot of questions about what would happen with the fortune foal plan facility itself when when they proposed the original when they originally proposed solas so just to follow up on that in an application any application i guess and there's a commitment to a time frame and we've by this time um did the applicant just rely on on the opportunity to make an amendment should there be changes or was there some awareness that it could take longer i'm curious that when an applicant says we'll start by this time and then it's relatively easy to make an amendment to ask for an amendment in this case was there some understanding that they may not be able to make the timeline not that we're aware so i mean there's nothing that i'm aware of a record and talked about that you know pg was already aware that they wouldn't meet those time frames that they would need a time extension so whether they do it or not i don't know that's certainly nothing on the record that i'm aware of that articulated that and so you know when council approved the amendment one for the solar facility you know it was with the understanding that here's the beginning construction date here's the ending construction they you know the certainly within the rules there is the ability to request you know an amendment for you know this facility and other this time frame there's currently the ability to request two amendments so again i couldn't say what they do at the time but on the record there is no mention of that that i'm aware of okay just a really quick question um is part of it due to this particular special time we're in and over in terms of the bidding process that really been a part of it to exploring that now that i don't have that level of detail in their comments it was just stated that based upon their bidding schedule the next rfp round that would be available for them i think they did every three years so one would have been 2021 the next one will be 20 24. okay thank you any other questions go ahead this isn't a question but it seems to me the decommissioning of the coal plane is thing that had unpredictable obstacles that they had to overcome as well as changing from a fuel source that was going to be biomass they thought i mean that and",

committee's charges I like it's going no questions and uh Zachary Mario any any questions for the x uh Debbie I'm gonna turn it over to you for discussion on your committee and um electric uh whatever we call it Electric Tools electric electric equipment use yeah so um the way that I outlined this is different from from what Dylan did I just went along with the bullet points on the deliverable um that he put into the um into the document so I did there was four bullet points and I kind of out outlined where we're at on those four bullet points right now um so that's what I've got up here yeah so the first one is um how do they align how do the policies align with the emissions reduction goals um so I wrote down what the climate action plan is um and that's to reduce 50% of of the Citywide greenhouse gas iions um for the base compared with the Baseline year of 2016 by 2035 and to be carbon neutral by 2050 and then I looked for in the plan this specific part that relates to the two-stroke engines that we were kind of focusing on and um they it says within three to five years it was put into that since 2021 so as far as timeline goes right now is a really good time to start doing that um and you're supposed to develop and Implement a plan to phase combustion and two-stroke engines within the city limits so um that's kind of what we're going with and um I think that they align very well um getting rid of the two-stroke engines and phasing into electric with with the climate action plan I think it's an important part of it um but one thing that I did find out is that I can't find in the climate action plan that it talks specifically about landscaping equipment I can't find anywhere that it does that maybe I missed it um but it focuses mostly on um ruction and transportation I think is the primary source of carbon emissions I also didn't find that it talked a lot about um other emissions which is one of the worst things about the two-stroke engines is the is not necessarily the carbon emissions it's it which is not good but it's uh all the other emissions because they're not regulated like regular engines are so we've got a lot of um you know uh talks about particulate matters nitrogen oxide Benzene for Malahide and I don't see those in the climate action plan just see the carage um so I would like to see that you know as a big part of it for getting rid of that's an important thing I went to a neighborhood association meeting and they were talking about trying to sign on to getting rid of gas powered leaf blowers yes within the City of Salem which I I agree with also um but one of the problems they had is that our climate action plan talks about carbon uh emissions and it's only 4% according to the uh EPA of all the carbon emiss come from the two-stroke engin so it doesn't look like a really important part of it but with all the other emissions accounting for 17% of the Vol organic carbon 12% of nitrogen oxide 29% of the of the carbon monoxide and those are all important too so that was one thing I found out um so basically uh because the two stroke engines are so inefficient and they're not regulated like regular engines are uh one hour of emissions from a gas power Leaf lower is the same as driving 1100 miles in a car which is crazy and a typical weekly Yard Service creates more pollution than revving your car in your driveway for 10 hours so it's just not accounting for all of that uh the inefficiency of it I think um so that's I think it is going to help us Advance our our plan um but I think it's underestimated when we look at the uh the plan that we have so the next bullet point was evaluation of existing city parks and um and I really have a hard time with this because I don't I really need a lot of help from staff because I don't know the existing city parks and policies other than um other than the uh climate action plan so what is the is there an internal policy on when do we use battery uh equipment when when do we use when do we not use battery equipment During certain Seasons or do we just when when how much do we have how much have we already transition I thought um no both noi and mil sent you information with regard to what's already trans because I could have been sworn I saw was copy on stuff that was sent to you guys relative to that 2022 um there was an there was an email and it said that they looked at um all the different kinds like the uh the stream trimmers and things like that um and those were pretty good at the time but that the Le Leaf power gas power Leaf flows were not the battery power wasn't Lo but that was a year and a half ago and um and I know Joan emailed noi again and hasn't sent anything to to me so I don't think she got any responses for about that I haven't emailed anybody because we were asked um to go through Keith because we didn't want to bother the staff so um I haven't emailed anybody this is a good chance for me to talk to people and try to you know establish that so we can um I can get more information to staff like can't I can't find the step out okay I know they've had some conversation with Joan but I'll I'll follow up with Joan okay well with my staff see what they've sent John and kind of stuff because I know both of them from the urban forestry standpoint and then from Parks operations I've sent some information with regard to that so yeah well yeah and I think one of the questions there Jen is is are there existing policies around it or is it just kind of uh you know your staff practice uh and kind of the approach right is is there any I don't know that there would be any like city code related to this um or any other kind of official policy versus uh uh in the moment kind of decision making of we need to buy a new piece of equipment what do we buy here right like that type of I could be wrong on that but I guess is if there are any policies kind of which direction might Debbie and Joan and Mauricio look for that and Juliana I saw your hand up if you want to respond to that um you can go ahead and respond first so there's not a formalized policy that's established a lot of that is predicated on availability and need and budget quite honestly each year we have a certain amount of budget each year this is what we can think this is the amount of equipment we have to do because obviously we go through with all of the parks that we have in staff we go through um equipment very quickly by comparison to a lot of entities so um so you know those are all kind of drivers um so there's not been a formalized policy per se as to how much is going to be for example each year that we're going to swap out and use this type or in scenario um that kind of things so it's really for staff is looking for opportunities on the type of work that they're doing and what's available on the market um that will meet the needs for maintaining parks and that is not cost prohibitive because we buy lots of equipment obviously for 92 parks and so you know we try to uh it's just kind of a continual kind of annual thing that we replace as availability and as need um but we can't we we don't have the ability completely clear something out and buy all new we we we run stuff until it dies and we can't it's not you know reasonable to keep fixing it and replacing it um so because obviously budget's a large component of that but when it dies are we trying to replace with electric I mean that's and again that's when we look at to see what's on the market what's available for the use that we're going to need to do because with maintaining in in 92 Parks that's a lot of heavy use continually all day long you know 365 days of the year and so um so you know we we we're just we look for opportunities it's an ongoing process I guess when we do that and Debbie thinking about and Julian I know you had a comment here but just thinking about your committee and kind of the recommendations right one of the recommendations could be for the city to develop a policy of replacement right and and recognize in that recommendation though that to Jen's Point like that's a Major budgetary Impact act right and in electric stuff potentially being more expensive and so that's something that if city council were to adopt that recommendation it's also going to have to follow up with with budgetary approaches uh to that as well which might be difficult uh in the current moment for the city um and and so that but that I think that's something that the committee could consider right is is would it be appropriate for us to recommend a a replacement policy um for uh the parks um equipment uh and if so what could that look like right and Juliana did you sorry I keep talking please jump in no um so for that I was just going to say if you could also include in like looking at a policy if you could include um contract when the city contracts out so that's not as much Parks but it is more for like the other City buildings that contract out those Lawn Service type of uh program so if you want to look into that as well that is something that the client action plan has also expressed interest in so if you have that as part of your policy I would love to steal some of that from you Sor to jump I I think a few years back this council did adopt um not necessarily for landscape equipment but for City vehicles uh to replace them with electric vehicles and to do that and and they had a goal I don't remember remember the year to be honest by but by a certain year um with the intent of replacing City vehicles for electric vehicles um to address climate action plans and so forth I think some of the problem has been so the city has started that",

        "text": " include cash incentives helping folks access state and federal rebates design assistance installation of solar on some large new projects and they also offer an energy advisor as well for certain types of projects I think those larger Redevelopment so I think so this strategy is written fairly generally I think promoting their services there's a lot of different options and things that we can do I've started by putting this information on our website just links to their to their website we can do social media I'm going to work with our communication staff to kind of share different tips and social media radio we do radio we do a few ads but I think another one that I haven't yet and spoke with staff is in our development services and our permit staff they probably are in a good place to kind of if we have the information for them to kind of start sharing it as well it seems like that's if we're going to really make an impact we need to be working with the developer I think you're right on the community you know as we're doing education and things like on development code and our Salem and all those different things that seems like a perfect opportunity to be working with them getting the information out there to them yeah I think you're right so that's something I'm planning to do um we do get a lot of questions or I have already just you know what what kind of incentives are out there right um so it's just good information to have and I'm going to try to consolidate that but I think you're right working with development staff um and then reconnecting with Energy Trust I think you know every so often and get feedback from them on what they think would help I would like to see some sort of really specific plan that connects this with our with the development staff you know with you know maybe to have Lisa talk to us about ways you know thing actual I want some tangible things um I mean I think all of the promotion everything is great but I think we really need to be getting this information to every into every conversation we have about development yeah I mean that's so I'd like to see some sort of plan that that it captures that that sounds good that makes perfect sense to me so yeah and maybe the plan would um I want to open up the conversation for Lisa to be free to come up with ideas for incentives right even not just how do we promote it but how can we even incentivize this kind of I mean I don't know what we could do to make it you know more attractive for developers to go all electric but I would love to have that conversation yeah okay great I'll reach out to Tilly soon thank you other thoughts on this one okay it's pretty quiet okay so TL 24 I'm just gonna kind of keep moving through the list fairly quickly so charge for City controlled parking starting with on Street in the downtown business district again this was another one recommended that we start with in the first couple years um and with your emotion last week mayor Hoy it looks like um staff are going to come back soon with a plan forward to start hopefully implementing I know that there's a number of concerns parking in general raises a number of concerns with the community so as was mentioned during the council meeting and I think as I've heard from others you know public engagement and Outreach communication is going to be a big part of this um I think there's also some additional studies analysis and another parking study that will need to be done so I'm looking forward to learning next steps and excited to see it hopefully and this is one where you you talked about it initially Heather about other benefits and really the while this is on our greenhouse gas reduction strategy list it you know the motivation behind my my emotion actually while this was certainly in the back of my mind that we had other there are other benefits as well so it's I think we can yeah so I think would be good to be able to capture that yeah absolutely thank you um okay a n e n 11 create a climate Champion partnership program in collaboration with major energy users in the community um honestly this is one I've not really dove into just yet it was listed as the long-term strategy so one that we wouldn't even begin to start um at least for five years out um the the strategy language in its entirety references working with the state the school district um and you know other large Industries perhaps which I think would be an incredible opportunity I think it would be fun and be really visible to have a program of this nature I do think that it makes sense for us to first kind of get a better more solid picture of our own energy use and our Municipal facilities and that's um actually that's another strategy en12 that is on the work plan for this year so I I think we'd start with Ian 12 get a better picture of of where we're at I know that we've made a ton of improvements in retrofits to City facilities over the years so I'm trying to get my head wrapped around all of that um and then what what are opportunities moving forward before we then take kind of that information and start promoting it with other users makes sense to me along those lines Keith and I actually had a meeting scheduled for this morning that got canceled with Maria Pope the executive yes Chief Executive Officer of pte so it would be helpful if you could arm us with some information for that when we get that meeting rescheduled because I know that that's one of the things that she wants to chat about or you know strategies and ways we can partner going forward and that kind of thing so it would be helpful to be able to see that conversation up at least during that initial meeting so you'd like information on Municipal facilities or are these well I think your programs I think Municipal facilities for sure you know getting it because we have I know there are projects that they're really excited about like our micro grid out public works and that sort of thing that they want to talk with us about are there wait you know are there other things that we can do similar to that and so I think it would be helpful just to have a really good sense on the current state of affairs where we have solar you know where we have opportunities for solar that sort of um so I think just having a like a okay what's our current status I think that would be very helpful for us um to just get that conversation started um when do you think you'll I don't know usually those meetings take a bit to get on the calendar yeah yeah I was excited to see this one when I was prepping for this meeting um because this kind of gets up that idea I think I've talked to you about it before that the city can't do this work alone right and we're gonna not only need every individual home uh to and folks to really uh get on board with just changing our behavior in order to respond to climate change but a really great place to start is with these businesses and the school district and yeah I think it would be amazing to see them sign on to support this and I agree and whether we have you know logos that we could create for their business doors or whatever that their Partners in this work or whatever it seems like it would be a really great step forward okay yeah personally I don't think you have to know exactly where we're at in order to ask for help other people does that make sense I get where you're coming from but I would love to see this maybe start in this next calendar year or so okay uh just to try and get folks because everybody is moving in this direction already and so if you can get some kind of synergy around an idea then you get momentum within a community and I don't think it would be very much money to go out and meet with these people and and in my mind get them to sign on create some kind of online presence or or signage that that you know really clarifies that they're partnering with us and I don't know what that looks like in the future is there you know a annual Summit where we all get together and talk about what we're doing or how are we I guess that's part of more of the conversation about like how do we how does that look what does it look like to be a partner maybe one thing that we could do since we haven't actually reviewed that one yet maybe it would be time to just let's pull that one forward it sounds like there might be some interest in pushing that timeline up so no that's helpful to me we're getting a new superintendent with the schools so it's a really great time to and I know that this is just such a passionate topic for young students and so I think that we're missing out on making a connection by not doing something soon with this okay that makes sense to me yeah thank you for the feedback on that I actually did hear from the school group and I can't remember their name I they're going to be reaching back out again but they have started to work with schools across the um to kind of work on energy efficiencies and other climate related efforts so I know there's a lot of interest it would be nice to kind of tap into that and connect so thank you great okay I see those schools with all those big roofs and I just think like come on good discussion so we are now at en31 Implement policies to reduce natural gas usage this one was called in our plan for as a medium one of those on the medium timeline so three to five years it was initially thought we would start looking at this we've learned recently that Eugene has moved forward just passed a ban in its natural gas starting this year on residential and that was low rise residential so nothing about three stories is my understanding and that was only new construction so not existing um so they are moving forward Milwaukee passed two resolutions earlier last year asking staff to come back with code um for uh to prohibit gas infrastructure again in residential and that's beginning in they also the second resolution was for City Gas systems that are failing to be replaced kind of electric and I think in some instances starting right away on that so A couple cities are looking at um I've not seen a whole lot at the state level here yet I know buildings and Energy Efficiency itself has been a big conversation topic there's a resilient buildings task force that's had a number of conversations the Oregon global warming commissions had a number of con conversations on building efficiency there's a few bills kind of on the",

        "text": "land so that's we're envisioning that as more of a boardwalk and not so much a pav Trail or anything so um yeah nearly $9 million for the regional okay we've talked a lot at you now we're gonna ask for you to talk back us Bruce I see your hand up so I really enjoyed hearing can you hear me yes really enjoying hearing this this presentation just a few thoughts from from my perspective in Economic Development and and I want to think about it some more but I think scenario b or alternative b or whatever we're calling it seems like it creates more flexibility um and maybe some lesser cost in terms of Roads or whatever I mean I want to I want to think about that some more but that's my immediate reaction I really like the idea of these opportunity for the larger Lots on the East because should there be an opportunity for some kind of a larger campus um this could be the the the place um for that I'm not talking about a larger campus like Columbus Ohio is doing with Intel you know I'm talking about something that meets the scale of of of this region uh to grow Advanced manufacturing and and and Technology uh manufacturing um and I really also love the idea that we could create smaller lots and smaller projects on the west side of Elward I mean I I think that I've seen some work that Metro is doing I I guess very initially looking at the need for smaller lots and smaller projects so I could see I could see that some of that being you me over time creating some incubation space for you know a variety of companies uh the bigger companies could be accommodated anywhere you know in in larger projects on the east side and it could be 60,000 foot users 880,000 200,000 foot users whatever in planned parks on the on the east side of Elward and in parts of the West could create opportunities for entrepreneurial smaller entrepreneurial companies whether they're uh you know for you know new new ideas and new new um new entrepreneurship to to grow with here within the Portland region um that's sort of a comment I do have a question because I don't know if there's been any conversations with PGE Northwest Natural or uh well let me start with that and then I'm thinking if we're looking at opportunities for now this is two questions really PGE and Northwest Natural but also making sure that we're going to have the tech the infrastructure technology the technology infrastructure needed for let me call it a technology park so so I just wondered if that's part of part of the the analysis I guess we can address PGE first we did meet with them as part of this study and they got some feedback to us um gave us some of their distribution tion mapping that's that's anticipated uh the guidance they gave us was let's try to reserve a spot for about a 5 acre substation um they didn't and we don't want to locate that as part of this again part of the flexibility um but I think um whether you take one of the smaller lots and you almost dedicate it to a substation or you carve out a corner of one of the larger Lots um there's definitely opportunity here to to locate a substation of that size in this area um as far as transmission corridors for PGE um they generally are following uh this sort of grid that we've got um we didn't feel the need to Overlay the two necessarily but at first glance it felt like hey they're you know they're kind of following the same materials and it looks like their plan roughly aligns with what's suggested as either one of these scenarios yeah and with respect to Northwest Natural uh and Technology infrastructure that was beyond what we were uh scoped to do so we don't had yeah that's that's fine I just I just wanted to bring it up for and that's obviously future connection since we work closely with all the utilities and and yeah you see we've talked Sherwood Broadband but Sherwood Broadband is really a basis for all kinds of broadband to come in not just our own our own company if you would our city a city utility sure would Broadband but and I didn't know if there was any other infrastructure that should be thought of for the kinds of companies that have that have gone into other technology manufacturing areas within the region so that that's the only question I had um one of the things we we roughly address it in the report is that the utility sizes that we proposed are generally for what I would consider sort of your run-of-the-mill pun pun intended uh industrial site um you know if if we're looking at uh industries that are really high water users then the pipe sizes might need to go up or there might be need to be some other assumptions in terms of water supply um that the existing system might not have capacity for uh you know in the the current Network um similarly The Pump Station might need to change sizes or the the trunk lines that were're proposing might need to get upsized so um you know we're we're trying to hit what we would consider uh a typical use for you know the high-tech users but if there's you know a major manufacturing component or there's uh high water demand users then those assumptions can change this is great thank you and uh also when we met with PGE they talked about that as well that some high-tech users want redundant power which could mean which means different things to different companies in some cases it just means they want Power feeds from uh two different uh in other cases it might mean they want to be fed from two different substations such that if one of them goes down they can still be operational um so PG he's basic plea to the city was keep talking to us which we always do that's our it's the first to go to when we have a company looking here so that's thank you yeah from PG standpoint thank you yeah always keep us in the thanks that uh Glenn Amber you add your up yeah thank you um uh I might throw my weight behind uh at least an initial take of liking scenario b a little bit more I'm wondering if uh perhaps the city can to what the sort of game plan is for designating about 50 acres of Upland habitat as mixed employment use um you know title 13 resulted from Metro already having done an inventory a significance determination and adopting a program for the protection of those Upland habitats and I'm wondering sort of what if there's an expectation that actually this area will be able to accommodate employment uses and sort of um local Road NW Works through that how the city kind of intends to get to that point despite title 13 yeah thanks Glenn I think it's a a good and important question I mean first and foremost I'll just say the city of Sherwood um is supportive of Upland habitat raran habitat um we hear from our residents all the time that they that they value trees and would like to see trees protected um and we don't get habitat quite as much but certainly tree cover is a comment that we get a lot and so we know that our residents are are um they have value sea value in the trees as well so I don't mean to punt this I wasn't involved in the really early stages of the concept plan so I can't speak to exactly why you know why the purple if you will was shown over this entire area um but I think from my standpoint in position now I'm happy to look at this area closer um as part of the comprehensive planning to determine the the value of the habitat there you know and comply with Metro standard so you know I think Glenn you mentioned last time that there is a connection between the um chicken creek and this Upland habitat which provides more value than say a standalone um tree canop Standalone tree canopy so you know I understand that as well I think um I think we will we're committed to looking at the value of that habitat more through the comprehensive planning um and if they're you know in way the the jobs uh versus habitat protection and of course we will comply with any in all metro metro uh requirements so um you know right now in our development code I think the way we comply with title 13 is not through a direct application of title 13 if you will we kind of have the the the developer has the opportunity to go through a more detailed um study of the value of the habitat and then we get to whether or not it should be protected um so I don't know exactly what what this area looks like and what the development code looks like in terms of complying with the Metro Title 13 area um but I'll just say this you know I certainly don't want to put down um a development in this area or have others do it that doesn't respect the this you know Urban rural boundary that doesn't respect the um it doesn't respect the trees and the habitat that's there so I think you know we want to get a really high quality uh mixed employment Zone that uh that employees are like happy to go to and perhaps they can go on walks and you know do an exercise after work all that sort of stuff I think you know all jobs and no trees is is an approach uh but I but I don't think it's the really the orgon way and so I think I think we need to look at it more um and see what value is there and then you know really try and get a again a high quality mixed employment Zone um that that takes into consideration habitat entries with jobs as well yeah I I I I could imagine that um you know producing in the concept plan a map that shows areas that are required to be protected as mixed employment will um could raise some questions and uh it I guess it's theoretically possible that the city could take on the goal five responsibilities to sort of redo the work that was done um back in 2005 to redo its own inventory to do its own analysis um I would just uh caution assuming what the outcome of that process would be um because it of course it could result in a determination that that no this area just as Metro had already determined is significant and warrants being protected and if the city were to you know be expecting to be able to develop it um uh and you know relies on particular growth in this pocket and not be able to I would hate for the city to be in that position um and I so I just like that the creativity that came into uh scenario B by um having a road go",

        "text": " you off mute in a sec um but what I wanted to just quickly add to that is we actually have legislation that directs us to establish these programs and that legislation actually directs us to do it in coordination um with ohcs so definitely working closely with them all right Jay I'll let you know when you're off mute you are off mute I wanted toh touch on Jeremy's comments uh earlier and and I certainly am not immersed in all of our offerings but the only we an Indy trust operates uh in offers incentives for several of the investor own Utilities in the state and I can't think think of uh any incentives that I would consider to be huge with the possible exception of a heat pump pilot that we're running right now that is both Limited in time and budget um the rest of the ones that we offer at least in IOU territory are um basically cost effective and incremental um so I I would hope they would be leveraged into this program but I don't know that uh we're going to contribute much to the going over exceeding 100% on the project cost thanks great yeah thanks for confirming my thought too Jay we do have some new state key pump programs that are just just are pretty new one of them is for rental homes and then there's one that's being launched with um Regional administrators throughout the state I think just one region is up and running that's um sort of the south central region of the state um and that particular program is for homeowners um and so these two new programs are up and running and those programs can offer pretty sizable rebates toward heat pumps for what it's worth um but again it's not allowed to go over 100% if you were to stack it with any other rebates so um so moving on to uh one more thought here um this is Jeremy again he says landlords generally generally in parentheses prefer window replacement and AC heat pump installation and that we should encourage bundling these with other measures like installation and J to agrees with that and at this point we don't have any other chats or any other hands so we can just give a few seconds of awkward silence and move on to the next slide we've got one more person with her hand up oh that's new sorry I just looked and I didn't see it Jennifer hillh har has her hand up go ahead uh you're off mute you're on totally fine I did it right at the end so keep keep you on your t to um you and I'm sorry if I missed this but regarding the last questions is Odo going to be working with um utilities at all in this Outreach because they utilities do have lowincome Bill discount programs or at least the big IUS um so they have uh at least access to that customer base I mean in general but that specific narrow yeah area good good thought Jennifer we are working very closely with util um will you remind me that those are is that IUS and cus that that new program just IUS that's what I thought okay I just wanted to check that was my memory as well okay yeah we're working with both consumer and utilities utilities and lots of other folks that are kind of doing administering similar programs or working with the same folks on energy issues so right right I figured but yeah but great flag on that in yeah rental assistance or not rental assistance the bill pay program which is new and people should look into it if you don't know about it's really interesting uh another person agreeing with Jeremy and Jay that um incentivizing the things that aren't as flashy would make a big difference like installation all right so now I'm double checking again I still don't see any hands up and I don't see any chat so we can go to the next slide and I'll let you know if any ANS come up again uh so the US Department of energy requires the Oregon Department of energy to submit a consumer protection plan as part of its application for the homes and here programs this must include a system for collecting and responding to Consumer feedback resolution procedures a data review process an on-site inspection strategy a qualified contractor list and installation standards do you have any suggestions for the development of a strong consumer protection okay I do see a hand up I was looking at a comment that we have in here from the last conversation just Jeremy pointing out some examples of where there's incentive programs like I was saying the renters program for us which you could combine with um if you're in a manufactured home where the program has a higher cap um for etto you could be putting together sizable um rebates Jay you can go ahead on this question on consumer protection please yeah this may sound a little self-serving but Energy Trust has a trade Ally uh Network that we leverage um and that might be a good place to start with qualified contractors it's not comprehensive and there are certainly people operating outside our service territories but uh um it could it could we've been working with them over time and if they're on our uh list we generally consider them to be credible and qualified Jay that's one of the things that we've been looking at is can we leverage existing um standards and efforts from our our parallel programs in the state in order to to kind of get a jump start on implementing this program for one um so that we don't have to wait to qualify contractors before people can start doing work um and and other considerations like that so we appreciate that comment um and I know that we've been doing some work um with some of our partner programs kind of looking at where the federal standards for qualified contractor list differ from the current program standards and what we can do to bridge the gaps to kind of get a good jump start on the on the list and other similar aspects of program all right um Jeremy suggests that we partner piggyback with existing programs that have standards already to keep things consistent you he didn't say that but I assume that um and Arlene just shares contractors will be a big part of handling the rebate participants should be able to connect with contractors for the resolution of issues is her right um Tim hi Tim Miller seems the total cost of projects should get oh sorry should get some level of venture view or a percentage of projects especially if there is any financing owed by consumers and Jay your hands up is that a new hand or an old is it an oh you're off mute so you get to answer verbally it's an old hand and it's down now thanks J um and then U Lexi's saying it's her understanding or their understanding that the federal tax credits do not apply to owners of rental properties and can't be used for rental properties and so there's a question there I personally don't know the answer and I don't know if you do stuff if um the tax credits apply for rental properties I believe that they are only eligible for a primary residence homes um I look like that's what I'm recalling from memory I can double check you don't have to double Che right now we can we can have someone else do that all right um let's see I don't see any hands up oh well we got another chat um where do you imagine Consumer Protection Program to be housed um perhaps within the One-Stop program or possible um I think it would be housed within the homes and here program versus the One-Stop shop is meant to sort of be a tool to help people access um information so it could be a place people access information about the program but I think it would be housed with the program itself but Stu if you have other um I think usoe just requires it to be to have a plan that we Implement um so likely would want to use some of the administrative funds from the program to cover it um but it could be part of like a wider strategy uh that Odo has for doing consumer protection for our programs um so it may wind up being more apply housed in um of not specifically with the program staff for the homes Ander program but um maybe some agency staffers that are doing this for programs thanks for putting that in the stuff uh looks like yeah did you see David's comment to stuff uh it looks like multifam rental could fall into commercial see yeah we're getting kind of conflicting pie of information in the chat on the tax credit who it applies to um but we have the IRS multiple multiple tax credit programs yeah so the IRS ultimately has the guidance on um on what is and isn't allowable and they refer to the energy our Energy Star website for like what equipment is eligible so I would say definitely if you're um wanting to figure out how those work um use those resources as Emily mentioned earlier this is not a program that we are implementing we can just kind of point you to the right resources all right so I think Emily put in another answer on the energy efficient home improvement credit so look to the chat if you want more on that uh we have a question can a nonprofit landlord participate in homes Agia University I don't have an answer off the top of my head Emily I know you've been diving into the ALR details you might have come across where I have do so we'll um dou we see your question and we'll have your email from when you logged in so we can find that out and follow up with you all right so we appreciate the great question we love finding questions we don't know the answer to because it gives us something new to learn all right I don't see any more chats and I don't see any hands up so we can go to the next so rebates will support the economy and jobs such as contractors who will install energy upgrades what supporter resources to contractor sorry um what supporter resources do contractors program implementers and other Energy Efficiency Workforce uh need to be ready to implement the homes program I dropped a u out of this one sorry chy I that you up for failure there oh there we go this was a new slide from my practice so and I know we've got lots of contractors on so this is a great chance for you to tell us what you need because we're working on that sidecar Grant application like right now we'll be getting that one in before we get this um much larger application so we need more workers with construction skills not just supervisors but people who are actually interested in installing we also hear a modeling software that isn't so expensive so and then we need to know how efficient the equipment needs to be like heat pumps and then um to have an update up-to-date website or blog with current info",

        "text": " doesn't but it says counsel to the extent practicable if there is a federal nexus if there's federal permitting for a project try to use the same reporting chinese the same thing reduce duplicative efforts so that the state isn't over here requiring somehow something exactly the same but separate so it does it doesn't have that statute in front of me um right now but so to the extent that council can um statute encourages council to combine those efforts so that aligns and i'm not we're not talking about the details today but an example of what we use in support of this forum iv um because there's this federal nexus and particularly to resources that are talked about under the council's historic cultural and archaeological resources standard and because there's a federal nexus um the lead federal agency or the bureau of land management um has to undergo the section 106 review and that is um that's consulting with tribal government and state um historic reservation offices and really kind of going under a rigorous cultural evaluation for impacts and mitigation for cultural resources it takes a long time and particularly with a project that is this big um and there's also site access issues where idaho power will have to gain site access to then do the surveys to then comply like do go through the section 106 to which we make recommendations that say council should you know have findings on the designation of those resources and impacts to there's more to it than that but that process we just don't want a condition sets sets them up for failure we want to be able to give ample time for them to be able to comply with all of council's site certificate conditions but be able to do um the other complex obligations for the federal review as thank you i'm just uh refreshing my memory and i know this isn't really a subject for today but given it's and four here if there were a later amendment they're subjected to to extension right two this project would be subject to two extensions and then completion is that right i think it's two um almost specifically construction extension and two extensions so period like okay to extend all the healing so it would be four and four for extend establishes originally there's there's something nothing specific in rule that three and three are important for based upon kind of survey data and other things council has landed in three and three but that's not required okay but in the the amendment you know to you know it is three and three okay okay thank okay so under um division 26 of the council's rules um there are that ensure that construction and operation of retirement facilities are accomplished in a manner that protects public health and safety and the environment um and so these rules include requirements for compliance plans except um inspections reporting and notification of violations so um general standard condition two this is it's and we present this and discuss it and it kind of goes back to that this is a complicated project and so this condition requires we're at um requires the submission of basically a pre-construction plan how are you going to do this um that has a nexus with how do you comply with the conditions and also what is the construction plan and then uh general standard condition three this is again you'll see this council thesis and all of their site certificates during construction every six months there's a construction progress report and then condition four general center condition four is the annual report um that is the operational annual report so once the facility is in operation on april 1st they're submitting a um construct or an annual report now the requirements the annual report is interesting throughout the proposed order um because our condition doesn't go through you know it doesn't identify everything but if you go to the rules it has a list of the items that has to be included in every annual report so every operational facility goes through they provide the information in the annual report and so for this facility you'll see some of the other conditions and i'll talk to one about one under organizational expertise but we have other conditions that say you know what yes and and also also give us this information in your annual report so that in their annual report they're going to have everything the rule says and then they're also going to be including the reports or whatever from inspections down here um you'll also see it with um there's other conditions for i believe we have it for the con every six months in the construction report so it's not just the what is required by rule we also have other conditions that say yeah and by the way give this the department and council in these reports okay um so oh yes councilman hi cindy connolly yeah um before you go on to condition six i don't know if sarah had a chance to talk to you but on condition five general standard review condition financials may have to do with my unfamiliarity with how things are written but there was confusing language uh with respect to design and then legal so there's a paragraph let me get to it and now if you go in the project order sorry i think it's like in page 30 um but it speak there's an opening paragraph that talks about design and then the condition speaks to legal description and are those used is it like a survey legal description of like a legal description of the survey so it says the department representative to require that the applicants submit final design information to the department as well as the planning departments this condition yeah that's exactly so weights and bounds okay so we have final design information and i read that as you know design of the sodium and go down to the condition and it talks about a legal description but not the the design isn't used and are those are the same does that make sense well the thing is it's like um the mandatory this the in general standard the mandatory condition itself says the legal description required for this rule needs a description of meets and bounds or description of the site by reference to a map and geographic data that comes directly from that mandatory condition right but up above we say final design so it should almost just say a facility description yeah i mean it was just um i was looking for it was not you know like have some good design and got really geographic information yeah yeah i was just thinking i was missing them um there is a bit a disconnect there i'm trying to think if there's other areas like functionally i think what we get from this is that you do actually get like um you do get a map set well they they have a map i guess like ultimately final design means what is located where right um so that's the best of me i thought well that that's what it means to me and so to me but if we get a legal description that says like where you know the location so meets meep and you know here's the transmission line with no design i will just whatever the descriptions for the outer boundaries this is kink and i think it's not bad is the outer boundaries that contain all parts of the concept that we're saying yeah so yeah i'm just wondering about what is that mean for that top paragraph okay i guess i guess we didn't have that top paragraph yeah yeah yeah well so this is sarah esterson for the record that preamble to the condition says we're recommending that you modify the language of the mandatory condition with final design and adding the what is in the condition is only the county piece so i think to make it all fit we just need to strike the reference to final design information because it's kind of inherent in either as kellen said meets and bounds or when if you get gis data in the final location right i mean it makes it confusing that it makes you do something when it's already there okay all right so thank you i was just confused striking thank you i appreciate that uh okay uh should i stay i'll go back i'll go back to the i just have to figure out how to get there it's like i just wanted to be briefly enough yeah no yeah and this is totally appropriate this is exactly what we're here what we're doing and back okay two annual reporting okay those are interesting um and so and again uh and um i'm sorry i haven't even uh i should have premised this but usually do everything i'm talking about today um in my presentation and that was in the staff report is not everything that's in that proposed order right i've kind of gone through and i've done a cut of like things i think are interesting um but if there's questions like council member content with of any condition findings um that aren't included in my presentation then we can totally talk about them please just bring them up so general standard review can just condition six um this is what i think is in uh it's one of those more it's one of those interesting conditions that's a mandatory condition but we really have been we point to it and it says that the facility is going to be designed constructed and operated and retired substantially as described in the site certificate so what that what that what does that mean um what is how do we do that ultimately what that means is that um like attached to the proposed order we have a list of the draft site certificate conditions but ultimately if council approves the facility there's going to be a site certificate and we're going to kind of lift that whole description in that front end of talking about that the energy facility and related or supporting facilities and that can be you know supported with a table that summarizes the facility with the description um and uh so that's so that's kind of that's that in fact practical sense that's what it means so it also just gives a little bit of flexibility because ultimately in our compliance program and going out there doing construction or operation you can just then just look you know like what is the condition i'm looking at what is the facility component so that's kind of part part of that um then recommended general standard review condition nine um this is another mandatory condition but it just is one of those i don't wanna say like um like um it's not redundant it's like a stop stop gap i don't know it's a secondary protection that's built into every site certificate council is very used to seeing that revegetation is usually addressed under fish and wildlife habitat and it's talked about under land use but there's also this other condition that does require revegetation of impacted temporarily impacted areas um and so this condition points to the revegetation plan and then there's also um condition in fish and wildlife habitat that points to the revegetation plan so it's kind of it's a little bit redundant but just to remind council that these are some of",

up to The Ridges where where in a sense the wind is and that that's I just wanted to point that out and other than that we don't have any other where where we will be providing some some written responses to the DPO um but there's nothing particularly that we have comments for tonight and so um with that you have our names uh I believe I just wanted to confirm we would now step down as uh other public um comments happen and then we have an opportunity if if we elect to to come back up that just before you st down just because there were some questions and comments earlier if I can go to councelor delin First do you have some questions of the applicant uh no I think the applicant addressed my my issue and I realize that there'll be more impact in the area during construction that once this is constructed the actual impact on many of those areas particularly the extra leased areas is going to be minimal um I was interested if I mean I know that they've investigated probably very thoroughly what are the best sites uh for their facilities uh do you see any future expansion uh within that footprint not at this time within this footprint okay thank you thank you and councelor Grail did you want to go further councelor berer thank you Vice chair Condon um just if we could ask staff to clarify in the DPO the micro sighting that the layout of the actual impact area I think the table summaries that showed Disturbed areas were very helpful but to your point to make it clear that that microing is here and impact area is a a different issue so that's good clarification and if the DP can reflect that that would be helpful did that make sense thanks thank you councelor and secretary cornette yeah for the record Todd cornette yes thank you council member Byer and so between the draft proposed order and then based on comments that we received tonight and through the close of the record U and also including the council's review of the DPO we'll certainly make note of that and then you know good better clarification within the proposed order yes we can do that thank you okay with that now you may step down thank you Vice shair yes and we'll before I open the hearing up to public testimony I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways the comment portal email and handing in your written comment tonight so I I do have two uh green forms for people who in the room who want um to provide testimony are there are there more that I don't have so we're not going to set a a time limit because we've only got two right now so um I'm just going to call you up so King here yeah and thank you for being here tonight and if you could state your name and spell it that'd be yes on camera I have my notes here but I need to make sure you can hear me okay thank you my name is Wendy King w n d y k i n g my family's Century Farm is located on little Butter Creek in Marrow County just north of gleon but gleon but is the site to multiple wind towers proposed through Wheat Ridge East efa1 the peak of gleon but is 3,189 ft above sea level it is the highest peak in the northern half of Marl County gleon but can be seen for many miles away and from many viewpoints along interstate 84 just east of Borman through the echo exit the but is visible for the majority of Highway 207 as it parallels Big Butter Creek it is approximately 5 and a half miles south of Meyers Farm the presence of wind turbin on our view shed wrecks our enjoyment of our property with countywide Vistas that are pleasing to our working family here is where I have issue even though Maro County Planning Commission has not protected this Landmark many of our community consider it an aesthetic Scenic value I doubt Marl County saw the need to protect many of its natural Scenic resources because they just didn't anticipate there would be an issue or they never thought to ask the community because this impact may be felt more by viewers from Umatilla County perhaps it was never considered important to Marl County to allow wooden turbin to outreach reach the peak of glein but will destroy its natural beauty the blinking red beacons visible even at night will remind us of its presence building these turbin on top of and to the north of this beautiful Landmark can be remedied by excluding any turbine whose blade reaches above the peak of 3,189 Ft above sea level my opposition comes in part from the impacts to our family Century farm from the sitting of the 500 KV transmission line b2h that is slated to cross through our Dryland wheat operation passing just over 1 half mile from our Homestead causing a substantial increase in aerial chemical application costs and impacts to crop lands adjacent to the line loss of our ability to use our air strip and hanger Our Father bu and the tremendous emotional distress from the fsac and pu processes that we participated in and received little consideration at this point I would like to say I think that sighting was extremely important for energy transmission versus energy production and that may be characterized here my point here is that the energy facility sighting Council so far has no notice of the cumulative impacts of sighting facilities in our community solar wind and transmission construction and laborers could Collide in a short time frame and how is our rural community going to be impacted not to mention the lack of consultation with Marrow County Road Department to adequately plan for multiple projects sharing roads at the same time many of these roads are characterized as open open range giving livestock and farm equipment right away in closing I ask that you consider the impacts to our working farm and the many Working Families of our community that will look at these towers each day we ask Wheat Ridge a small concession of excluding Towers from our view shed of GLE and but that will provide some relief while we cope with the presence of a 500 kilovolt transmission line to our North our Century Farm is an agriculture operations surrounded by eight energy projects on all sides we've been approached by solar developers to use our land and we simply desire to continue farming and ask for consideration to limit negative impacts to our enjoyment of our property and livelihood thank you thank you oh yes secretary cornette sorry for the record um while we're recording this it would be very helpful if you submitted the information as well um so whether you submit that today or submit it you know through email we would appreciate the you know since you did read that it would be helpful for us to have it in a ad live part that would be fine as well um but yeah just um it it is helpful for us to get the you know the written comments as well as the oral comments um so not a requirement but but a very much appreciated very good thank you thank you thank you very and Sam Meyers thank you for being here tonight thank you my name is Sam Myers s m m y RS I'm a local resident there on little cek I do have some concerns with this am uh the uh the expansion is uh sort of an issue to me and I'll explain more later but uh gleon be is also uh a view shed that my sister referenced uh I've taken probably hundreds of pictures of that as a as an amazing backdrop to our farm uh and I'm asking the council to again at least move the towers that were positioned on the peak uh to maintain sort of the peak's landmark status it's disappointing that this particular but was never listed as any kind of important Landmark it should have been I'd be happy to do that um or request the Commissioners in Marl County to do that if that would help I couldn't help notice the scenic standard um so apparently not having any registration um it passes um again I ask can the council some uh recommendation that even though it's not formally uh listed as a landmark or a viewshed that it' be treated as such um I'm also very concerned in the expansion of this project that um that the um the expanse of some additional 50 miles of access roads uh present a weed problem and a fire hazard at the same time the roads are so uh rural in this area it's going to take time and effort to get to these places I can only imagine requiring a staff of three to four maybe more people that's what it would take to actually address the the weeds and that occur not necessarily during construction but soon after and if construction takes years then it's then too but it's an ongoing effort I know the effort personally because I maintain you saw a brief picture of little butter cck I end up managing almost a mile of that paved road because the county only comes out once a year maybe so in June July kosha will take off because any rain we did get the the principle that happens is that the water sloughs off the road onto the shoulder so instead of uh instead of being in a 12 10 12 in rainfall area that produces an area that's more of the equivalent of a 15 or 18 inch so these weeds capture that moisture that's drifted off the side of the road and they take off and what I've experienced I I have to almost rename the road the kosha corridor because it is lined with kosher weeds that are four to six feet tall and spaced a foot apart so it's a challenge at best it's a nightmare normally to deal with this because the plant itself can produce upwards of a seeds so it's not it's it's going to proliferate it's going to drift into the neighboring crop land it's going to it's going to destroy the fences because the stocks are so big they don't go away for years they produce a fire hazard Because the skeleton is so big if a fire does go through there it'll exacerbate the length of the fire flame because there's so much material to burn if kosha gets started on some of these access roads it's going to make everything much harder and it's going to elevate the fire risk my",

        "text": " how uh we would look at the analysis of impacts and and then make a determination of significance in our next issue too but um yeah I think that that's definitely a good good point to make about um how we should be thinking about setting the St Aras and and we'll look at I'll look at those rules as we're moving um forward and make a note of that comment as well um Dean did you have a comment okay can you hear me now yes okay great I I was accidentally on mute um when I look at the four um options they make me a little bit nervous it looks like three of the four options would reduce the analysis areas and I'm I'm specifically concerned about Scenic resources I'm concerned about all resources es but I have expertise in Scenic resources only um there's no empirical basis whatsoever for reducing the um analysis area when it comes to Scenic resources um most renewable energy projects and well other energy projects and transmission lines all have uh potential impacts that extend out quite a ways from the project area and so there's just when you were asking before about imp um evidence there just isn't any to to uh you've already got what a 10mile radius I think on a project for analysis on visual impacts 10 miles is already way too small when it comes to certain kinds of projects like wind turbin it's far too small uh for PV collectors it probably is appropriate uh but to think about reducing the analysis area I think is going in the wrong direction Fuji yes hi um I guess similar to uh Dean I just want to say I I I feel the only one here is number one um unless we have some other Alternatives uh the I feel like we're going in the wrong direction we're here to protect resources Scenic resources protected I mean we're not making more of them if anything we're making less of them and so I feel like just reducing this is not helping matters if a project does not have an impact or then what's the harm in the study area being larger I'm sorry developers May cost you a little bit more but let's face it the area is established because there are impacts and so to me reducing that impact area is not the answer um by resource type um I think if I'm saying this right for example the solar resources may be something to look at and get some more evidence on I I could see that um you know if you put a solar farm on top of the whole uh data Farm somewhere that might have much less impact than that same footprint on Prime habitat for sage bells or for other birds or or whatever so I I mean that I think that can be argued then um when it comes to that that particular resource but I think the I notion of reducing what we already have here um I I just don't think that's the right direction to be going in and I do think we need to look and have study areas Beyond Oregon's borders I didn't mention this earlier I mean the legal thing aside and there may be nothing we can do legally outside of our borders however a study area is a study area and resources and habitats and all that do not um correlate with our geopolitical borders so that's all I have to say there and um I'd like to keep number one no changes in the study area itself great thanks Fuji um and I think that um yeah you've all given us a lot to think about and look at in this um I will just say that you know so what I've heard is is that many people think that what we have is appropriate but that it may be appropriate to adjust uh specific study areas for specific types of facilities uh if we have some empirical basis to do that so uh my request to you all in the short term would be if you have any sorts of studies um that you would like us to look at in making this determination please send them over um otherwise we will uh continue our review and determine whether any changes are are um okay so with that I think uh um we'll move on to our second topic which is related and it's about the methodology for impact analyses and again I'm going to point out that this was again a issue that was raised by stakeholders during this process um and that is whether the council's rules should provide more specific methods for the evaluation of impacts to Scenic resources recreational opportunities and protected areas uh and I'm actually really glad that uh some of our federal agency partners here are uh present because I know you all may have more um experience using some of the specific methodologies we'll be talking about but um basically the feedback is that our rules require uh once we've established those analysis areas um they require the applicant to describe potential impacts to resources within those analysis areas and demonstrate that the proposed facility will not result in significant impacts um our rules do not at this point require specific methodologies um for impact assessments to be used under any of these standards uh and we've had some stakeholders raising concerns that this lack of specificity in our rules uh has led to some inconsistency in findings and and sometimes in adequate Council findings um and so those stakeholders have recommended that we adopt a specific methodology for visual impacts assessments um for my own benefit I guess but also hopefully for yours I wanted to go through just an example of a uh kind of generic visual impact assessment um this was taken from a comparison of different uh assessment methodologies used in various Nea processes um but basically the process would start with a facility uh description of the facility and identification of any facility components that may have the potential for visual impact um looking at the analysis area and conducting a viewshed analysis to help identify where the um visual impact receptors would be so where the resources where you could see the facility from R um doing a key observation Point study uh identifying the effected activities viewer characteristics and deration um and the landscape character in The potentially affected area um then looking at you know the applicant's proposed mitigation strategies to mitigate any potential impacts preparing simulations um assessing the nature and magnitude of the visual landscape character impacts based on those simulations and the earlier uh um analysis and then identifying the significant impacts and determining whether any additional mitigation might be needed and so like I said um this is just kind of a generic overview of what I full uh evaluation would look like and our rules don't necessarily require all of these uh steps to be met but most of the visual impact assessments that we receive at least cover some of this process and gen and follow the the overall U I guess uh outline of the process pretty closely um even if sometimes you know visual simulations might not be included or a key observation Point survey may not always um for projects that are on um and I can go back to that slide in a second if anybody wants to see it again um for projects that are on federal lands or have an intersection with Federal lands um applicants often use the US for services scenery management system or the BLM visual resource management system um I'm hoping that since we have some folks from those agencies if there's specific questions about how those systems work you might all be able to address those um and then um we've also had uh at least some references to the Federal Highway administration's guidelines for visual impact assessments um that provides it's a follows a similar outline as those other uh two systems uh but does seem to be a little bit more tiered in the approach and allowing for a more abbreviated review or more extensive review based on the scale of interest in the project um and then we also just wanted to includeed that one of somebody had recommended that we look at the Oregon California Trails association's Trail setting classifications U manual and while that manual is really uh overall more of a uh resource inventory tool um it does have some good guidance on how to uh analyze the impacts to visual setting for particularly cultural and historic resources so um these are some of the resources we've already been looking at um and um in kind of thinking about whether we require applicants to use one of those systems or maybe um a set of those systems or just identify particular aspects of those systems which could be used um we thought it'd be helpful to kind of whis them out so our discussion questions here um I think we can kind of again just maybe address them as you all see fit um but would be uh one one of the most important aspects of a visual impact assessment that that should be included in the council process um whether we should be requiring one process or whether there should be uh differentiation between context resources or impacts uh and um and while we're really focused on visual impacts we did just want to uh give folks the opportunity to uh raise other examples or other methods that we should consider when we're looking at other types of impacts as well um so that's the issue in a nutshell and if anybody has any questions I'd be Happ to answer that otherwise I'll go ahead and open the floor to comments uh Dean go ahead thanks um yeah this is a really interesting and big topic and a lot of people are tackling this issue right now not just um Oregon fsec for example the forest service has just started a process to update its system for visual assessment it's kind of out of date it was last updated in 1990s Federal highways updated their system in 2015 I'm currently working on a handbook for California Department of um so that they can have their own system that somewhat follows Federal highways but then tailor it to state law in California which includes the sea uh requirements um and I I will add that oh and then the Bureau of ocean Energy Management uh has just completed a handbook for offshore wind specific to Offshore wind which I think is easily adaptable to other energy projects including onshore wind um so those are all ones that you should be looking at um the other thing I'll say is having work with the FC uh manual a couple of times not not manual exactly but the rules uh it's wholly inadequate what what you've got right now is is really really inadequate um an example would be um on simulations uh simulation technology has changed quite a bit it's a lot easier to do than it used to be it's also a lot more exacting in terms of its standards than it used to be I mean I'm old enough that we used to do just handes and then wireframe diagrams and then um Photoshop um and now we have these um simulations that are photo realistic but they're still very limited in in uh how you apply them I just say for",

        "text": " but give him a little bit of time to get ready for it i guess um so any does that work for people we did public comments and just kind of next steps and then whatever time we have left we can return to that issue great okay so um what i wanted to do here we what we already did was we elevated all of the attendees that are here as members of the public to panelists anyway so if there's anybody on the line that wants to give comment that isn't on the work group feel free to raise your hand just so i can keep it somewhat organized and then i'll call on people okay that was my comfort level with extended silence about 30 seconds but i don't see anyone one thing that i wanted to do since it hasn't come up one of our work group members had to leave early she told us from the beginning she had a conflict today and so um so that's allie from ally rosenbluth from rogue climate and she kind of wrote what some of her thoughts were on opportunities and barriers so i just kind of want to put them out into the um and just make because i didn't hear them come up necessarily um one thing that came up from her there was a somebody brought a workforce something else that came up was from her was um kind of seeing how there's all this new funding out there but then there's like a lack of capacity and technical expertise on that on the side of potential applicants to apply for those funds and i just wanted to share here that um odo is putting forward a possible legislative concept that would create a position at our agency to be sort of a navigator for environmental justice communities which includes rural communities of color took a pretty long list of economically disadvantaged communities and so um those communities could come to us and say hey we're interested in this can you help us and we could provide technical assistance help connect project ideas with funding ideas so on so forth so just know that we have a little something on there but i think it's worth maybe putting that as an opportunity or barrier um wherever we would like to and then another frame that she had that didn't really come up was like who are barriers hurting or helping and are there some barriers that are good um that for example what she was thinking about is things that protect um tribal resources so just food for thought and then i also just want to flag um her thought of how do we generate more funds like psf for around the state and we know we have the community renewable energy grant program but it seems like it's going to be wildly popular it's only four years right now so how do we increase that or extend it or something like that so just wanted to since we had a second i thought i'd use public comment for ali so she couldn't be here and then um with that rob do you want to talk a little bit about next steps and then we'll see where we are in time sure yeah so next steps um the next meeting we have is going to be june 28th again at 9 00 and this is going to be the discussion to talk about um economic resilience other you know impacts and benefits associated with these projects in you know this is one where we really hope to wrap around on some of those overarching questions that we've seen cutting across our different work group sessions and um really try to get at the um associated with these smaller scale projects so that we can formulate those into the study and so um you know we've already hit on those quite a bit in the in the first two meetings but in in the next meeting we get to really look at some economics and specific benefits and we're hoping um to wrap up a lot of these kind of outstanding issues with that discussion um and so we continue to do some planning for these these meetings i think um you know thank you all to the the planning committee that helped us to put this together i didn't do that at the beginning but we have individuals within the group that are helping us to set the agendas recruit speakers and it's extremely helpful to get that support from our work group so thank you and um you know following the july 28th meeting or the june 28th meeting um we will then have a recap meeting on july 28th so one month later and that's where we will try to some possible recommendations from all of the meetings and put them before the work group for discussion prior to the drafting of the report i think that pretty much sums up our next steps oh you're on mute any questions overall on what what's coming next your role in it anything like that i hope that we have a date for our fourth workshop planning committee i honestly haven't checked the doodle since i asked people to fill it out again yesterday so i'll take a look at and circle back with people all right i don't see any hands raised so i'm trying to think about how to handle how to best handle the situation that we have which is um some folks wanting some clarity from john on what the rules are and i don't want to misstate the question or or i don't i don't know enough about it to try to launch the conversation and not get myself in trouble so um i would welcome rob if you have thoughts on kind of how to kick this off or if there's a question someone wants to ask or how we want to get that clarity from john or if john just wants to come off and you introduce yeah i don't mind transitioning and and certainly taking it back to john um is a fine idea but the way i took that was that the the land use prohibit dual use it just doesn't um additional um it doesn't give credit for it either so um to to say it's not allowed is not technically true it's just that doing it doesn't bring you any additional acreage into the discussion of developing on prime farmlands so um john i don't know if that kind of describes if if i may and i have to apologize i can't see anybody i can't see anybody i i hope you can hear me um but first of all i want to thank you guys rob and chris you guys did a great managing and facilitating this this conversation and i've been thinking about it and and i think you got it right robin um but i think i'm understanding more of what where angela's coming from um which is just a different place than how i inclined to look at it um it's not wrong it's just different um and i guess i was looking and do look at things from a legal perspective there are no laws that say aggrovoltaic is not allowed um in conjunction with you know photo photo takes a little project or really anything else um i think you know i you know i can't be corrected i think where angela's coming from more of like of a perspective of practicality and that uh if i kind of if i'm kind of connecting these dots correctly the 12 acres may not be sufficient to justify an aggraval tank project and because 12 acres is a limitation on high-value farmland not just in the valley but across the state high-value um that you know adding that all up means that no one's doing it um which i think is is is also um you know something i can i can appreciate the question i guess i kind of wonder about what is what is the right threshold i'm okay i mean i don't know i can't say that i speak on behalf of our entire agency but i'm okay personally and professionally getting back into this conversation well what what what it take you know is from a policy standpoint is this a good idea and lcdc has given a nod to that in a little a little little way uh in the beginning um but i i think that was just the beginning of the conversation you know is there are other um obviously many people think there are uh other people are a little less less certain a little dubious um and what would it take uh what would it take to you know properly set the table for that type of an arrangement to happen um and i'm curious you know i was thinking about this and i was like well if if the threshold is you know 40 acres or 80 acres or anyway something bigger than 12 acres um and that means a project that has a nameplate capacity of more than three megawatts and therefore not available or qualified as being a qualifying project under purpa and doesn't get those those you know the benefits of the of the contractual would people do it i mean would people do it without that certainty provided that they would get a power purchase agreement so anyway i know there's that's a that's a lot there i guess what i'm saying to tie this off i think rob you got it right there are no legal um prohibitions on conducting photovoltaic solar on any under any solar project there may be practical constraints and then there may be more than one practical constraint that you know represents kind of intersection of different of different policy so i'll stop there but again thank you for the time and um i really appreciate everybody i've learned a lot lis i listened a lot um and so i really enjoyed this thank thanks john and angela do you want to go yeah thank you um well first of all let me clarify something that john said that i'm not sure came out quite right about purpa so purple projects are legally 80 megawatts and below however the standard contract for purper projects is three megawatts and under and had the ability to have a standard contract is the thing that allows a purple project to really move forward there are purple projects larger than three megawatts but it's a lot more challenging to get those done and thank you john for clarifying dual we are saying the same thing that solar is not allowed on high value farmland over 12 acres currently that is not a viable amount of space for solar right now and so my point was that dual use solar is not is not allowed practically because uh projects over 12 acres are not allowed and when we talk about in the especially in the willamette valley um it just means that solar is not getting built and the dewey julius isn't getting value we heard from pine gate that their project was 50 acres and even that was financially challenging um and so there's it's it is unrealistic to expect that dual use solar will happen under 12 acres thanks",

        "text": " to finish this so um now there's further uh work done which condition one requires and so when we issue the site certificate if we decide to issue a site this suggests to me that if we have now a new characterization on the ground site certificate stands and that we have confidence that the facility can be built design construction consistent with the standard that it seems to me two bits of information we issue the site certificate with one set of information and now we have new information that we have to be confident that they can design meet the standard yeah i mean that question applies across standards where you know there's a large amount of true up based on actual data so it is a combination of desktop and some survey combined with what you would get out of the condition so it's a asking of that second bite is that second bite in the condition strong enough to meet the standard thank you this is uh empire and just for the any of these kind of after council decisions require the council to delegate the review to odo staff to department of energy staff the site-specific information on soils or landslide hazard would come back to you and possibly with the assistance of department of geology to review to make sure the standard is within the approved project so i don't know what happens if if within the site boundary there's a landslide hazard if there's a design around that would happen as a result to still meet the standard is that the process kind of yes on that it go the the review is delegated to the department and that we would we do um engage our reviewing agencies including dogami um we also it would this would transition over and to the citing analysts are involved sarah's involved but it also goes to our compliance program and we also work with consultants and we can have you know our consultants who assist with compliance assist with that who actually have geotechnical engineers um now the last part of your question so the question is is if there's actually so there's a seismic or non-sizable hazard and then there's a design variation that happens to avoid that hazard i don't how would we know or what is that what is the question mrs empire i'm not quite sure if i can follow it completely through the process but it sounds like the applicant would have the option to design around the hazard given the standard that speaks to design and operation i think the option or so if in the site specific geotech investigation that happens prior to construction a landslide hazard is and now we're getting a little close to ss5 to be honest but a hazard is identified that avoidance would be the first option and then mitigation through geotech engineering you know slope modification drainage there's different techniques that they would have to look at and i just wanted to highlight a couple of the changes that we recommended council include in structural standard condition one as a result of issues raised at the dpo to try and strengthen it a little bit was a requirement that the investigation plan this is just the plan that that be prepared by a professional engineer or geologist licensed in oregon we wanted to make sure that they had experience with organ related issues and then similarly that that report that the the result of that investigation be prepared by the same professional engineer geologists licensed in oregon and then we did add i think based on facts that were presented in comments on the record of the dpo additional specifics um that had to be evaluated different um methodologies that had to be used to evaluate risks and um uh council member buyer um i think my numbering i have it no it is it is 10. so in the condition sub 10 you know that's it's do the evaluation and then you know additional information it's one of the real lengthy conditions but it says define and delineate geological and geotechnical hazards to the facility and identify means to medicate the identified hazards so there is an area a requirement that says you know tell us if what you're seeing and then how are you going to minimize or avoid them thank you for the questions any other comments or questions from the on the proposed order structural so i think we're ready then mr ratcliffe to move on to the exceptions on the structural all right thank you mr vice chair and members of the council so the issue that we contest case issue that we're going to be going to sorry is issue ss5 the limited party is john white the issue do we have a slide for the um issue itself i think we need to bring that up uh yes okay okay going should be one more oh the straw poll the next one nancy there you go okay so we have the issue up on the screen um that was raised by mr white whether the applicant has adequately evaluated construction-related blasting in union county the city of legrand under the structural standard specifically whether the applicant should be required to conduct site-specific geotech surveys to characterize risks from slope and radon emissions um and then on each one of these slides since this is our first issue we're going to be doing this we're going to have the issue up on the screen and we're going to have the references from the proposed contested case order where the hearing officer made findings of fact on the issue reached conclusions of law and then wrote her opinion and again because of the the complexity of this case the number of issues those are scattered throughout um and so uh you know it sometimes we'll necessitate some page flipping to tie things together if we need to go to the proposed contested case order but we wanted to get those references up on the screen so but what i'm going to do now before we call mr white up here to provide his argument is to go over the hearing officer's opinion briefly and so what the hearing officer ruled on this particular issue is that the council's rules allow the department authorized the department to establish the level of analysis that must be included in an application and allow consideration of the size and type of a proposed facility so then the department second amended project order and the project order again kind of sets out the scope of the issues that will need to be covered in the application that project order established that um uh what's referred to as reconnaissance level which involves some field level and desktop which is basically a review of existing literature um pertaining to a subject this level of valuation to provide a seismic and seismic risk identification at the site that this kind of scope that the project order established for required investigations was adequate to evaluate compliance under the structural standard the project are also established that a detailed site-specific geotech investigation for the entirety of the 300-mile site boundary was not required for the application due to limitations and practicality given to resulting from potential route and final design changes and limitations on site so that was one piece of the opinion is that basically the the level of information that the department was requiring that the applicant provide that that level of information was adequate to evaluate compliance under the standard and so um based on that project order then the applicant has performed a significant amount of work to the potential geological and soil hazards within the site boundary um and then the pre-construction condition um ss condition one structural standard condition one um would evaluate and mitigate slope instability issues the uh hearing officer's other conclusions were that mr white did not present facts or evidence to support his concerns that blasting would likely be needed during tower construction near his home um this is in legrand at towers tower numbers 108 slash 3 to 109 2. um and because site-specific studies have not yet been done um the standard had not been met so that was you know her uh looking at mr white's issue and concluding that there there weren't facts uh or evidence to support that and therefore the hearing officer ruled that the council could find based on compliance with the department's recommended structural standard conditions and soil protection condition 4 which includes a blasting plan the structural standard had been met with respect to that issue i'm going to stop for a second and you know council is familiar with these materials the exceptions um nonetheless what i just said was a um and gets into some technical areas um i don't you know uh i think the goal here is at this point to turn things over to mr white to um uh provide his additional argument but if there's just plain and simple confusion over anything that i just said with respect to the hearing officer's order you can go ahead and ask questions related to that and if if there aren't any at this point then i'm just gonna provide a couple of guidelines for what the the uh oral testimony uh needs to look like here at this point okay and look like it all right so we're going to call mr white up here in a in a moment and i just want to um go over a couple of things about what the the oral argument looks like here and the main point i want to make is that the evidentiary record in this process is closed and what that means is if you have new documents new information that you've learned that has not already been submitted into the the record as part of the contested case process or as part of your dpo comments or however it came to be in the record this is not the time to add new information new factual information um uh and the you know the by and large the point of the contested case process is to make sure that there's ample opportunity to get that factual evidence into the record what this is intended to do is to be an opportunity to address the council through oral argument to talk about pieces of the exceptions that have been that address your issue um and to you know share those items with the council that you have particular concern about or want to highlight so with that in mind um again we're gonna stay within the scope of um the issue that uh um you've been granted limited party status for um and if there's references to factual evidence that it is to evidence that's already in the record of the contested uh or the the um proposed order so those are all the preliminaries i have um and so uh uh mr white uh whenever you're ready you can uh come on up or do we have recorded i guess that's the other thing i should say is we have recorded testimony from some folks who weren't able to make it here in person today and so in some instances we'll be listening to her recording and then seeing whether or not the applicant or the department have anything else to respond",

the updated activities of the solar and storage rebate program i've talked with many of you either on the phone or via email over the last and we're really pleased as a department uh to be able to have more money to make available to you for projects we're holding this q a today uh in order to provide one last opportunity for folks ask questions of program staff as we move rapidly towards september 27th and again for those of you maybe that didn't see the i'm assuming everybody got our program announcement but if you didn't we are making the first tranche of funding available starting september 27th two and a half million dollars for non-income restricted projects and two and a half million dollars for low-income service providers and low and moderate income residential projects so we want to make sure all of our contractors have the appropriate information and the best possible chance of success starting september 27th one of the issues that as an agency we needed to work through in order to put ourselves in a position to be able to administer a relaunch of the additional funding was hiring some new staff to replace the staff that cycled out of at the end of 2020 and we've done that and if you've been engaging uh with the program in terms of asking us questions or calling in you may have talked to the talk to one or both of these folks but we have um gordon connis uh and jenna compton uh we're both the on the call today we're real happy to have him um and they're excited to uh administer this program so in terms of what we're gonna be doing today um this is just a q a for rules um we are planning on having a a full public rulemaking session starting in january of 2022. that's an um for the public to give us their feedback on how the program is going and whether we need to make any kind of amendments or changes to our so if you have great ideas or you have a suggestion for program improvement we'd love to hear those but the best venue for that discussion will be our public rulemaking process starting up in early 2022. uh and the hope is that we sort of limit our discussion today to the q a about about the rules and how we get you ready for september 27th so are there any questions before we jump into taking questions doesn't sound like it i'll just say a couple of things just sort of just maybe set the stage the laptop that i work off from is notoriously stingy with its ability to handle video calls so i may have to turn my uh camera off at some point if i get a little bit of laggy um just please be aware that if i'm frozen or my head doesn't move my mouth no you don't hear anything from me that's just my afternoon technical um we do have quite a few folks on the call so um you can simply sort of maybe raise your hand or uh if there's a lull in conversation feel free to just sort of ask your question aloud or you can feel free to use the chat function both jenna gordon will make sure that i'm um taking action on questions that come through the chat and for those of you who don't know or maybe are unfamiliar with the webex interface the chat function is found at the bottom right hand corner of your screen so having said that please the the four is yours oh this is james reese miller can you hear me yes james yeah okay um got a little list of questions here um for lmi um when is the tax transcript do for option three is that due on monday or is that due sometime afterwards or is that right right when applying for lmi using option 3 the text transcript you're going to want to upload the option 3 document itself and the tax transcript at the time you you apply my understanding is it's taking about a week there's about a week lag time between when folks make a request to dor and when they're able to get those documents out to folks so just be mindful of that and also be mindful that we have separate pots of money for lmi and and uh non-income restricted um projects as well so um one so so if you were to apply your option three and you just upload upload the form and you don't have the text transcript what will happen is um either jordan or jenna will review your documentation and if you were missing that transcript itself they'll mark your request as incomplete you'll get an incomplete notice and have 30 days to provide the required to us so my recommendation so quick suggestion is just generally to hold off until you have all the documents at once assuming this is going to fill out as it did last year if it's incomplete do you lose your place in the queue um as a as a practice i mean this is consistent with the way we handled it last year you do not but again we hi but i'll i'll note i don't mean to be like paternalistic about it but again we really encourage folks to um upload completed applications if we run into a scenario in which we feel like we're getting a ton of um incomplete applications or there's sort of a rush get some you know something in right sort of i want to just get my foot in the door we retain the right so maybe revisit how we want to handle that but for now um no you don't lose your place in luck okay so since there's only one place to put that document do you want us to just create a pdf that has the option three form and then page two is the track tax yeah that's that's one way you can handle it we i also had a question um from a contractor earlier in the week regarding um comfort level with the homeowner sort of not turning the tax transcript over to the contractor if you find yourself in that situation you can have them email us just the staff the transcript it's helpful obviously if we know what project we need to apply that to so um please let us know that information um but again if you find yourself in that that scenario we certainly can offer you that service but it's also i think important that the homeowner ultimately know that as a public-facing program any types of documents that they provide to us are subject to public records and so they should not feel that they're going to be operating under some type of confidentiality that's just not how the state works okay the website for the transcript took you to a place that actually gave us their tax return it didn't seem to have an option for just the transcript is the tax return suffice no no that's a yeah we don't so we don't we specifically don't want the tax return because the tax the difference between a transcript and a tax return is the the transcript redacts their personally identifying information so it doesn't have their their taxpayer id number yeah and let's see so i just opened up the get a copy of your prior year's tax okay so they've moved they've changed thank you for bringing that to my so the the link hasn't changed but what it links out to has changed we'll need to our records i'll need to find the where the link it i need to find where at the dor website you actually get the the transcript and link that appropriately to the form but that'll be a real priority issue for us we'll take care of that as soon as we thank you can i have one more question here um solar plus storage um the storage cost what are you looking for there are you looking for just the batteries you're looking for the batteries plus the upgraded cost of a storage inverter um are we is this just data collection are you looking for um real hard numbers here um it's a little bit vague right right you can uh let me uh i'm gonna open up here real that's why i am making sure that i'm referencing what your what your experience is as a user under financials typically uh there's the if you want to lump the storage cost in with your panel cost for the purpose of your your written contract that's fine ultimately we do need a total system and we'll need a system cost for the the storage component but i think your question is sort of is there some type of methodology that we need we need to see around how you choose to allocate costs for um yes yeah and and so there is none so i'll sort of leave that up to your discretion in terms of how you want to break that on the in the in in power clerk and on your co and on your contract okay because i'm like i'm imagining that there's probably some type of shared cost when in terms of like the install the labor component right right so what i would recommend is um obviously break out break out the but in terms of so i think the more discretionary decision will be how you choose to proportion your installation your labor costs and that's up to you that's up to you sure okay i have one more question on lmi with landlord tenant uh basically the landlord is buying the system putting it on a duplex that they own and the tenant qualifies for lmi does then the landlord get the benefit of the lmi rebate or is it just a normal retail because the landlord does not qualify yeah so for a residential project the the owner so well how best to say this the for residential projects it needs to be owner-occupied real property so the only scenario where we would have a landlord-tenant relationship would be if we were dealing with a low income service provider so then that means the tenant yeah so the 10 nothing would it wouldn't be eligible for anything in this program is what you're saying right yeah unless the owner could qualify as a low-income service provider but if it but if you just single like a individual that's unlikely to happen yeah okay yeah all right that's all i had thank you all right let me let me um transfer let me go through the chat uh what time does power clerk open on the 27th uh eight o'clock start a business for the agency can we apply for a client that is not energy trust not a yes absolutely you certainly can the program is open to project owners all over the state when the application process does the customer get notified by odo we don't we don't directly interface with the like the customers or",

this may be a question for CFO LaRue so if we're using general funds for this but we the territory that Yamhill Transit serves or is there is there additional sources of funding or actually let me back up when we say general fund here we're it's it's not exclusively property tax funding there's additional perhaps grant funding for these programs but in comparison to what is paid actually out of General funds or property taxes and all of those other funds that come in um it's a very small portion that we have other funding for great thank you um then I would just make an ass that in the same way that the trans Dash has a writers per Revenue hour I would love to see a similar representation to so we can better understand bang for buck as we think about how we allocate our limited resources um I think vanpool Works incredibly well in particular situations especially those workplaces you know you know farms for example Farm worker that that's beautiful it's it works where our fixed rap buses can't work but I also recognize that maybe not every location and so I I just for my own personal education I would like to better understand the limits of that okay absolutely thank you any other questions no no thank you very much awesome thank you for your time with that we'll move into board reports um and I did want to make a note that we do have our new service enhancement subcommittee in which we have oh wait I'm skipping over our general manager report I just decided that since general manager Alan Pollock is not here Deputy direct Deputy General Trimble please thank you president Dino's pressy as always I'm going to keep my comments very concise I do want to take a few minutes to introduce two new members of the Chariots team uh we have two new Chiefs that have joined us so for the record I do want to introduce both of them I want to start with Bao dong who's our chief technology officer he oversees I.T and the infrastructure division so just very briefly bio has many years of technology and Telecommunications deployment experience serving most recently as a senior manager at Amazon and spent quite a few years up at TriMet as well as a program manager in the IIT Division and Val's been a member of this team for about a month so Bao would you like to say a few yeah I'm very happy to be here uh really excited to work with the board and with everyone to deliver our strategory plan so thank you thank you Val and next up I'd like to introduce Sophie UL Azam and he is our chief Planning and Development officer and he's over the Planning and Development Division so Sophie II has been with us for about one month uh in fact Bao and shofie started on the exact same day shofie has many years of experience in policy development and also spent many years at Kansas City area transit authority it's a great deal of experience with strategy and Innovation and project control and oversight so welcome Sophie would you like to say a few words all right good evening everyone I'm happy to be here I'm trying to be precise as well so thank you and looking forward to working with you all thank you again Chelsea president you know who's Percy that concludes my okay I just got really excited about the servants and habitsman subcommittee and I just wanted we will be kicking that off I've assigned director Davidson director holmstrom and director Navarro to that committee so we'll be hearing a lot more from that coming soon um so moving on to the rest of the assigned subcommittees nothing else has really changed so I'm going to start off with director holmstrom do you have anything to report uh thank you president uh you know always Percy I attended the meeting of the community advisory committee uh last week good meeting I think you know the staff heard a little bit of an earful about the transition to our new um a Paratransit provider and you know from everything I can tell the staff is working closely to make sure that um all those kind of growing pains are are smoothed over and that folks are getting where they need to go um you know in our community especially those folks that are need to use the the Paratransit services so that's something that you know I'm going to continue to keep an eye on and make sure that that's that's working for folks uh one item that did come up in that meeting which you know was interesting is I think you know the the model how paratrans is supposed to work is that folks you know are come out in our are visible and present when during the time that they're supposed to be picked up and uh in the middle of a serious heat that's not always possible for folks to be able to do that especially if you know depending on on their personal situation and where they are and how they're able to handle you know tolerate the heat so um may have to think through some different ways of how that's operated I'm sure the staff is putting their their heads together on figuring that out and so a good meeting uh really appreciate the time of the advisory committee members to to come and we heard from some members of the public as well so thank you thank you director uh thank you so sorry that's really loud for some reason um not a whole lot to report coming out of Kaiser I mean folks are just getting ready to go back to school so there's a lot of families getting ready for that um folks are really excited about the construction going on at the Kaiser Transit Center um and let's see we oh I won't apologize for being late tonight I don't know what possessed me to think I could attend the town hall with congresswoman Andrea Salinas tonight and still make this meeting but I wanted to personally thank her for helping us get the 6.6 million dollars to be able to purchase the new electric buses um so yeah so we got those coming and everybody's just waiting in get back to includes my report very nice yeah no see went with her to the Ottawa Farm that's what you should should have gone earlier I'll remember that for the next one director Davidson thanks president um just a couple updates for me so it with my work with the mid Willamette Valley Council of governments um we are I've kind of previewed this a few times but we are now in Earnest standing up the Willamette Valley Regional Rail task force um it will the composition of which will look very similar to House Bill 2662 and we say on Marion Mass Transit District we'll have a representative on that general manager Pollock and myself we met with the executive director of the Council of governments and have talked through how we might be of assistance to that once we do get Regional Rail extended down the to The Mid Valley local Transit connections will be absolutely essential and so making sure that we're there to have those conversations right from the get-go I think it will be very important um and so stay tuned um probably in the fall that body will be stood up at some point and that is as a reminder being convened by the Council of governments um last thing is I wanted to um share a little bit about so as we we all learned at the work session uh I was uh unbeknownst to me nominated and then awarded the outstanding board member of the Year by the Oregon Transit Association it was a wonderful honor and I just wanted to convey here that uh it it's kind of a weird experience I'll just say that to you know people are clapping at some at some point people stood up and clapped which was even more strange but uh as I conveyed to that that audience then and now this audience here is that wow I think there's a charade or you know a collective disbelief that oh yeah the board member he did all the work that's not what it was I dissuaded them of that basically immediately it is in no small part thanks to the staff of Chariots from top down bottom up and um it's just a privilege to be able to represent chariots in that way and to see our work collectively recognized in that way so just wanted to pass that along thank you director Davidson director thank you very much uh so I will be reporting on scats for director Kearney who is unable to be here uh tonight and it is a bit long so I will do my best I unfortunately was not able to attend this meeting although I did get a debrief so here we go um the PC approved an update to the tip approving I won't get to to In The Weeds here because because we did get a little in the weeds but we'll see what we can do proving resolution 23-20 which amended the scats FY 2120 through 2021 through 2026 tip um that added the project key for the Salem area mass transit District's low or no emission bus and charging infrastructure so awesome they also approved the federal area Urban boundary um which she believes is going to be submitted on September 1st um the fob faub editions mean that any road longer than a neighborhood or Community street so she thinks that it applies to collectors minor arterials arterials and has to meet Federal design standards which include sidewalk and bike infrastructure and storm water management infrastructure the bulk of the meeting they discussed the Metropolitan planning area policy committee composition and Cooperative agreement for those of you that remember this has to do with the addition of Aumsville to the mpa which is a result of the new census results so the Chariots board we voted to support a facilitated process for updating the Cooperative agreement there's a lot of different interests at stake here so we did with the intention of arriving in a more representative and Equitable voting structure and decision making process for Scouts uh the Salem City of Salem representative which for us is counselor Phillips has indicated to the group that the City of Salem is also interested in using a facilitated process so we're in agreement the City of Salem represents about 180 000 individuals from their single seat right now so they represent significantly more people than the other entities a single single City ward in Salem has more residents than Turner Aumsville and unincorporated Marion and Polk",

        "text": " could do that or we could do something you know different it just um do you want us to bring back a report make a motion anybody else a couple of things that um I regarding my feelings about what we have in front of us and I read this and I looked at Billboards I didn't know about the spacing but I didn't really have any heartburn over them being so I don't I still haven't heard anything and we'd be compelling as to why they couldn't be there in the future because they are intended to be a massive detail with that I am I think lean towards um in the end music and the support of motion this would be the main one didn't that change or suggesting that staff came back with that I also think that it's worth asking we have staff craft language murals falling under the sign code that's very summarized but I think generally the topic is understood my own any thoughts do we have any anybody uh is anybody crafted in motion right now like you're just stitching to print and then I think more discussion on the mural issue I gave me a dense wanting to have that in the center because we can't regulate content that would open up the door to any mural being allowable out as a sign so if I'm going to make an emotion I would probably just make a motion to um allow the existing non-conforming signs to be relocated within the site but not allowed anymore also necessary for the discussion there is provision in the code about signage and you're not allowed to use a propane language um here it's not a lot of you express sexuality there's several uh limitations in the code around signage already so there's uh phrase that I think Aaron used about not able to implement art content um is only part of historian I think there is some language that it does protect that we're not going to have profanity into it in 20 foot letters on the side of the building um but I'd ask Aaron to be expand on that and then I would go to Kim chefs later on and while you're correct that we can't regulate content and we're going to look at our assistant city attorney's advice I know in general the Oregon Constitution does Grant a pretty broad allowance for freedom of speech um we'll have to go look at the business we have you mentioned on profanity um think that you're right that would be this wouldn't open the doors to widespread stuff like that but I don't have to go back and check to make sure My Consumer to be more with like you know that some paint a massive political sign on the building that wouldn't be able to be regulated I think would be more consciously regulated within the existing site code and buy the parts Commission right we respect that um and I I wish there was an easier way because I think going to um it becoming is in Salem from getting the girls I kind of I wonder uh not that important should be praised for a whole lot of things right now but I was really impressed with how many girls I saw these roadside buildings for any schemes that were clearly would be counted by our assigned code AS signage because it was intended to draw your attention but it was a series of shapes but it was it was beautiful and it was the side of a six-story building so um I I would I would definitely support uh best to find some kind of language setup that allows this to move away from mural to speak public art or commissioner say that you had comments too yeah I don't have strong feelings I'm a billboard issue I kind of could be persuaded either way on that but not my favorite thing to see in the world but people in private property rights and I on that but I think the art issue is very complex obviously and I'm not comfortable with the current regulation on it um it made it something where the staff needs to do some more research on it maybe we need a work group in cooperation with the public Arts commission but this just seems in some ways flawed there's a flaw in the process going on in all of this and I realize there's some constraints on how how we can manage it in terms of the content that this just all seems to be like a much deeper complex conversation that maybe should happen in a different just just on the art component to it Mr Fox uh so I'll touch on both issues uh first public art component um I completely agree I think we need to find a way to simplifying the process because as you said I think we are suffering from a lack of public art in the city and that's something that really you know we should be encouraging is that one element of beautifying Salem um and so yes agreed a work group and collaboration with staff or something to that effect I think would be maybe about to to achieve that uh as for the I think my understanding of the intent with our Salem and the nv3 district is that it's recognizing that there are a lot more people who will eventually be living in there and that's the hope and supporting the same level of that private place and creating very vibrant and pedestrian focused communities that also have retail within them I think it's the do you monitor intent and something that I would really like to encourage I don't see real words being something that contributes freely to that um that is something that genuinely speaking is you know found on major highways and and I appreciate that that is something that currently exists as an elementary I guess an olive branch toward that I would support the idea that you can relocate them within your site I don't think that we should I think we should um a job to currently proposed prohibition event thank you any other comments especially at the art commission um for the the murals um the it was a big Topic at city council like a year ago and we did have a work session on uh and Pennsylvania's um and they made some changes I remember also they have to send me or each Windows change the council recently but the council chose specifically not to open it up to to you know the ways we're talking about we did talk to the counselors about it could be in the sign code it could be you know you could just allow it and they were too concerned about unintended consequences and speech that we can't control so the council decided not to make that change last year so I don't know that they necessarily could change that changed this year even if you recommended it I just want to put that out there because it was quite a few meetings Aaron and I went and went to with the art commission staff and the counselors funding uh did adopt the street painting mural projects at the intersections I'm going to put that in the code recently and then I'm sending some of that so I didn't see that of sections um came out of that word to some of the other counselors but they chose specifically not to open that was like a year ago so I just want to throw that out there I'll just buy me a good idea but I just I'm sorry uh commissioner you guys it's a question I'm a stone wall that I built separate my property Street which used to just kind of money and to talk about having someone paid a neuron it's about six stars High uh would I be allowed to have somebody in your room in the mirror will be on the outside from the street no if there's no other comment um from what I've heard I would oppose emotion for discussion that uh be direct staff to amend their signed code to allow existing non-conforming report signs and mixed use Zone to be located in the event beside Redevelopment do I have a second okay vote on a motion Shelley you take a boat commissionary yes all right hi motion passes now I believe um we need a motion to approve being amended uh Salem Revised Code chapter 900 do I have a commissioner that would like to take that thank you so I believe that concludes the public hearing on the agenda item 5.1 we can move on to work speed and to agenda identity therefore solar leading study motion thank you and almost said my last vote was a mercy vote for the staff do not have to say that yet again so uh uh back in 2018 the Federal Aviation Administration put out a very helpful report uh identifying that the placement of solar and neutral energy infrastructure in uh in at airports wasn't that consistent with national goals for resiliency and uh National Security a number of other reasons so that really clarify the fact that you could could install some of the events and concerns uh previously of whether or not solar was appropriate to an airport especially considered a player and other package so that issue has been resolved there are design standards that the fa has set including the fact that um solar panels need to be put south of the control tower who pits out the people power and then it layer steady be done but the overall the overall question of whether solar is appropriate for airports has been resolved and so that kind of raises the question here and whether it made sense if you look at cell replacement at a sale on I think the answer is very much that it does right now the Salem is undertaking a master plan for the airport we're looking at expanding personal service we're looking at expanding additional general aviation service we have a significant amount of land smoke which is not developable because of airport restrictions and flight restrictions as well as floodplain issues and so to me that strikes via really a good opportunity to co-locate renewable energy in the space that might be less efficiently used a number of airports now New York Times reports that 20 of all Municipal airports have some solar a few airports including Chattanooga Tennessee have all of their electric electrical operation needs met by solar attended into the 2.8 megawatt system that covers all their operational needs which is kind of cool uh and so I think it's just a common sense recommendation that the city council used the opportunity of the master planning process to expand the scope a little bit and conduct a feasibility study for solar at the airport well I don't want to engage in green watching I think it does help sell the fact that we are potentially resuming uh commercial critical service there and provides at least some sort of offset to the fact that we're going to be expanding potentially in greenhouse gas emissions here at work and finally uh there's a resiliency component to this because it'd be a we integrate that with a micro grid and battery storage then it's a potential to be able to function uh in a natural disaster situation which I think is one of the real rationales",

        "text": " then we go next to to fact nervous and co-benefits I just want to say that kind of really thinking it through taking off my previous public agency had and really thinking about myself more as a commissioner and Visionary and um kind of you know making strong recommendations to our legislators is that we should look stronger ethical benefits versus cost Effectiveness I think if um I think it through is cost Effectiveness is important but should that be our role you know if we don't prioritize in this commission the ghds and the co-benefits um no one else is you know I'm sure there's a finance committee that's talking about cost Effectiveness I think we want to push and be much more um proactive and Visionary there and put cost Effectiveness Effectiveness as much as it hurts me lower down because unless we're more aggressive and really look at how it impacts our communities and our people you know just kind of what director abatement was talking about um we're not going to prioritize getting grants and getting funding so um although old public hats you know it's kind of are accepted I do feel that as a commissioner it's important for me to speak about that this is all about the benefits to our community our states um residents throughout the different areas and that cost Effectiveness needs to be prior in a different Commission in a different Forum so just my two cents in and Alan if that messes up your graphs I apologize but I'd be remiss to continue down this road knowing that kind of now seeing it visually it helps me really put this in perspective so my two cents and apologies if that message but definitely um I'm only one voice I want to make sure that uh my fellow Commissioners have their input as well I see a number of hands up um I I'm not sure of the order but I'll go to commissioner after first thank you yeah I just want to strongly Echo commissioner Jackson's statement I really appreciate you raising that and um very much agree I think especially given some of the conversation we've had just this morning but also in past um meetings around cost Effectiveness it's also um increasingly challenging to capture that in a way that fully reflects you know potential cost of inaction um costs of climate impacts that we're experiencing now I think the six climate assessment that was referenced earlier this morning is the perfect example of um so and I I just want to make sure um commissioner Jackson's comments are uplifted and that that we are prioritizing greenhouse gas reduction amount and cost benefits over over cost Effectiveness for those and and other reasons as we've discussed in past thank you commissioner after uh commissioner magnera yes I also just want to Echo commissioner Jackson's comments uh I think I've said this before in other meetings but uh cost Effectiveness often or cost Effectiveness tests often do not uh sufficiently account for Community benefit and some of the cost savings that can come to communities uh related to health care costs uh related to uh other kinds of cost benefits within the community and so that that disconnect I think it's important to rate the co-benefits p it's certainly higher than cost Effectiveness and I think there are other elements in the scale that could be valued more than cost Effectiveness as well because it is such an imperfect way to assess like the holistic benefit of a particular action thank you commissioner mcnaira commissioner Ford yeah good morning um yeah thank you uh when I read the materials I unfortunately wasn't able to participate in the last meeting in December but I did go back and listen to the uh to the recordings which I thought was quite useful um I guess I have a slightly different um I do think as we Frank these the cost Effectiveness it should be as part of this criteria and we should maintain some level of cost Effectiveness criteria here which we agreed to before so um so I just I want to push back a little bit and say we do have limited funds and um I think whether how we recommend actions because I think we're going to be recommending all these actions which I support by the way but I I do think we do need to provide some the information we do have on cost Effectiveness to the legislature and that because I think there's a full package and then how they decide they want to utilize that information is is up to the legislature but I do think it's incumbent upon us to acknowledge that certain actions um are much more expensive um and are not going to get us as far down the road so I do think it needs to be part of this discussion going forward but I agree uh that ght reduction is the highest priority and I think we've ranked it that way on purpose as a and so um you know we ranked co-benefits slightly higher than cost Effectiveness which I was fine with I I I don't think we should be de-emphasizing cost Effectiveness either in our recommendations so that's my thank you commissioner any other uh Gabriella you had your hand up would you like to play in I I think there were um several more voices that were raised um in support of the approach that commissioner Bateman and and Jackson were articulated so well and just recalling the discussion of this commission about the importance of the um to flag and to you know call for the resources that the commission would need um to be able to strengthen the you know Analytical underpinnings in these areas where there is um uncertainty and and using the cost Effectiveness information that we do have tends to undermine um you know some of the some of the priorities and can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good but um I this commission also has the choice of of how to you know how to present this information so thanks thank you um I'm going to suggest we go ahead and have Alan finish his presentation and then we can come back to this topic to look at all of these different things so uh just a couple of comments uh again uh Zach go back to that graphic we must we must do all of the actions to meet the accelerated goal so it's not as if we're choosing to not do one versus the other that's not the point here the point here is with limited resources as commissioner Reitman said how what what party should we send as a signal about which ones we need to focus on and as many said the the the focus is is on greenhouse gas reduction amount getting the biggest impact I would also point out that the this is just that small sliver if you recall back to the slides uh in previous meetings of the wedge diagrams the biggest biggest part of meeting the 2035 goal are the is that business is planned scenario with the 15 programs including HP 2021 and the CPP that reduced all those those are the primary drivers of getting here this is just a smaller wedge like seven million out of 35 million uh uh metric tons reduced in overall programmatic issues to get to the greenhouse gas reductions that we have so this is a small sliver of that larger piece of the pie and I would point out that that the greenhouse gas reduction amounts and and co-benefits are already emphasized in this analysis pretty dramatically especially in the in the evaluation criteria scoring and ranking process the uh cost Effectiveness out of 100 points is only 15 uh that commission actually reduced that from this recommended suggested 20 points at the beginning and so that's 15 points for that 29 Points for greenhouse gas emissions 45 for all of the co-benefits so three quarters of the analysis uh and the scoring is related to the the the the greenhouse gas reduction amounts and the co-benefits and only 15 is related to cost effective so I would I would say that you accomplish what you are saying in the way that you waited these and the way that the analysis ended up working out and so the the scoring and ranking is actually intended to be a more holistic approach that looked at all of those different factors and weighted them uh and and and and and in this instance um it did D derate or did uh put cost-effectiveness on uh as as one of the lower uh evaluated criterias I I would though have a bit of a caution commissioner Reitman I think is correct we have already received comments that the commission's ranking has put cost Effectiveness as too low and for those people that think that this plan should be based only on cost Effectiveness they that they're going to look at this recommendation and the and the ranking recommendation and the narrative around that that it as cost Effectiveness is less important to the count to the commission and that may impact the credibility of the recommendation that you put forward I fully understand the need to to position this because there's a whole bunch of people just want to do cost Effectiveness but just a word of caution in your discussion and deliberation and how you want to do this and then finally in the end we'll have a recommendation about how this all plays together in terms of tiers one two and three and uh it's up to the the commission voting members to decide whether or not that's that's correct so where we left off was were there any of the cost uh oh do any of the most cost effective ones uh actions Merit moving from up in tears and the one we thought was food waste next slide please Zach uh when we looked at co-benefits only um you'll notice that when we did the co-benefits a lot a lot of the high greenhouse gas reduction amount actions were actually ranked in the top 10 of co-benefits only remember this is just the three the 45 points associated with health and jobs and economic Prosperity so and then the uh other two other three uh three other ones were in tier two and the seventh and eighth uh co-benefit ranking ones were the least uh or the lowest in terms of greenhouse gas emissions so uh because of that fact number seven and eight uh we didn't feel like they should jump up into tier two because they are such a low amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with them so because of the co-benefits ranking it's pretty much sticks with uh the original tiering and so we didn't suggest any changes or recommend any changes to the tiering based on cost next slide please didn't get made based on co-benefits amazing yeah I think we're cost to benefit on cost of benefit uh cost Effectiveness Centric yes based on co-benef",

        "text": " Citra is ten acres there. It's RC one and it's been undeveloped. It's vacant right now. Work has been gone into clear it to it actually right now is an open door as to what's to be there and from some of the hurdles that's being presented, making it difficult for the decision to be made as to exactly what to do in that location. Now, true enough, it being RC one and it being vacant and it's undeveloped, all this stuff, the direction of that property will have a big impact on Citra. It's in right off that 301 when it comes to the truck stops and the traffic and rv parks. And it's just so many different options that that property directions it could go. And I'm here because I'm at the point where one little section there, that's that little yellow section there is still a one. So with that little section just being a one and the rest of it being RC, we get the map, please. Pardon me. Yeah, we don't see the map. Here we go. Oh, my bad. With that one little section being a one, from what I'm told is a one still. But the permit shows it's still being rc one. So what effect would that have on the rest of that property, as far as the development of that property? Because right now, like, you see, it's zoned off where all the pink is. That's rc one. But that one little section there is, from what I seen on the survey, is, is that it's a one. I may be wrong. I don't know. But. Right, that section there, that section, is that in un highlighted, was it pink? It's yellow. Yellow. Okay, so that is agriculture that's already zoned ag. But the pink is. Is that rc one right. There is a path to move forward. I mean, based on, should it pass the proposal, the rc one limitation would still be in place, but items that are being presented and permitted usages may change. Right. We don't know where that's going to be, but. And that property would be a prime example, I would think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but that would be with the b two zoning all around that property. That would be an appropriate property for someone to come in with their application to bring it into a conforming use, land use and zoning. Correct. That is an area where you would want to see that analysis. Yeah. So, I mean, if somebody wanted to develop that down the road, they would go through the process of making the application to change the land use and the zoning. Because you do have b two all around it. And I'm trying to remember what's. What's at that corner at 165th. So on the north side, it's undeveloped, but what's on the south side? Is there anything on the south side there this year? Yeah. Oh, yes. Currently vacant. Okay. That one was rezoned in 2022 to rc one. Okay. Clearly. But I've done nothing with it so far. It was rezoned to rc one in 2022? Yes. Staff recommended denial, but the board approved it. I was. I said the wrong thing. Sorry about that. I'm looking up what I want to look up. No worries. Okay. We can't answer that question today, but we. Bottom line, sir, is that if you want to do something now, and it's on the list now, but it's going to get taken off the list, you should make an application, get an attorney. My suggestion to any citizen that has rc and wants one of the uses that is currently available to them. Thank you. Yes, sir. Anyone else? Good morning. David Tillman, Tillman Associates Engineering, 1720 Southeast 16th Avenue, building, 100 o'clock, Florida. Also, I'm the chairman of the Land Development Regulation Committee. The concerns for the Land development Regulation committee were the fact that you are going to be taking away the rights of everybody inside that has rural land use and lives in a rural area. It's not just the farmland preservation area, it's the entire county. And so they are losing the option. And I would point out to you that whenever they, they brought up the code from 1996 for rc one, section a and section c, neither one reference one another and tie together, they are independent. And section a talks about the fact that everyone can apply for this. It does not limit who's getting it. Section circumental makes a suggestion that all of the b zonings that have rural lands should be converted to this. But section a gives the right for anybody to ask for this. It says, classification intended to provide for agricultural commercial uses that would be appropriate on rural lands not located in a rural activity center. It specifically says the lands that aren't inside the rural activity center have the right to this zoning. So to go down to c, which is two subsections later, and say, well, a doesn't exist anymore. This was just for all the b zonings, to me, is quite a step. That's not the way that looks like that was intended, in my opinion, at all. You know, whenever it comes to this zoning, the application, the only difference that the Land Development Regulation committee had that was significant is in this very first section of a, because we don't want to take away the rights of everybody to be able to apply. One of the reasons is the rule activity center is so restrictive, you can't have one within so many miles of another one. You can't expand one unless you've reached 85% of the use of the existing one. And I want to ask any of you, 20 plus years ago or in the last 20 plus years when the rural activity center stuff was selected of where it's going to be, have any of you selected or done something that maybe you wouldn't have done, maybe you would have done differently. We selected all these. We put them in place. We can't change them. We can't add to them because the criteria that's there, we can't expand them. There's almost none of them that can be expanded, almost none of them that can be created because there is one within the three or five mile criteria that exists that limits you from expanding them. RC one is the only option for any of these rural locations where it may make sense. RC one, as pointed out, has not been a problem in the past, many, many years since this existed. You've got 20 parcels that have it. People aren't coming in here and asking for them, and it is your decision to turn them down when it's inappropriate. And I applaud what horse farms forever is doing to protect the horse farm region. I agree with what they've, what the path that they've headed that they started on. I just don't agree with this one section. But the LDRC group also agreed with the limitation of a lot of the uses inside this zoning. There were three that stood out, the restaurants, the hardware stores and the convenience gas stations. I mean, a farm doesn't run without diesel and gas, so it is an absolute agricultural need. The restaurants, I mean, people have got to eat and how far do you want them to have to travel to be able to get sustenance? And the hardware stores. I grew up on a farm. We had it. We also owned a hardware store. So, I mean, I didn't have to travel far to get to it because I was there every day. But without, without those types of things, it's difficult to run a farm. And so those are the reasons we put those back in there. The example of a bass pro shop isn't going to be allowed with the restrictions of the language the way the LDC proposed it. There are square footage limitations to everything because we don't want the proliferation of commercial all over the farmland. That is not sensible. And we don't see our board as being nonsensible and allowing it to occur anywhere. But the option needs to exist, because if this option doesn't exist, you've basically cut off any options for people that own a parcel somewhere else. Or has it? If we selected a rural activity center in an area that the traffic improvements and the traffic hasn't occurred is where it should have been, there's nothing we can do. The way the language is written, RC one, is the only option, and we're about to take that away by changing, by changing that section a. I'll say that horses in our community, it's definitely a good thing. But one of the things that what I feel like makes our community great, is freedom. And this is taking away people's freedom and their options. That's what I have a problem with, with the proposed language that's being suggested. Policy two, 1.13 said primarily agricultural. It didn't say only agricultural in that policy. Because you are the chair of the LDRC I am giving you. I understand. And I feel like I've wrapped it. You know, I've wrapped up most everything. And I will point out that eligibility doesn't mean that it's required, it just means it's eligible. So that doesn't mean. Because the language that was suggested by the LDRC means that everybody has to apply for it. It means everybody has the eligibility. And that's the freedom that I'm talking about. And that's the freedom that I encourage you to keep inside our code. So when the racks, the locations were chosen wrong, we can't take away that land use from those people that have it. Because if we take that away, that is a Burt Harris claim. You've absolutely taken away their land use. And it is a Burt Harris claim. But we need the ability to be able to put commercial where commercial belongs. I'm not asking you",

really nice um except when the power goes out and then they get cold in a hurry it's not just call it or it's they're probably involved right yes it's different than in our a lot of our Conservatory or water they still have water right when you use that piece of water that's just you know that gets that gets back to the entire point of the other thing we deal with on the fire mitigation side if you want to we're we're damned if we do more damage we don't we shut off power to these at-risk communities High Extreme biorist communities they lose their Wells when they lose their Wells they don't have water um technically if we shut off power we're going to get we're going to get sued either way um is is the way we look at it because we've shut off their ability to protect their structures the way they see it because they can't get water if we don't shut it off and the fire starts we're so we're we're in trouble either way on both sides and there's uh there's the only way to mitigate the risk is um on that side of it yeah that's very similar for us too because our our risk is in our more rural areas and that's what it is you know Cascade Range the Coastal Range people are on Wells right lower density and same issue it is and and it's one that that I think every rural area deals with and struggles with on that side of it um to to keep them to have the availability of of their Wells staying on yet it's the exact same kind uh protecting everybody from fire yeah it should be rural fired yeah to also have access and volunteer firefighters to also have access to live in southern many times but it's really hard to find a good middle ground right we'll see you know maybe there's something in there for these cascading effects especially like like you say if you cut off the power and all those the elements the ability to fight a fire because they no longer have water locally and so maybe there's a way to build that into again that vulnerability piece um trying to identify the the greatest impact populations and letting those projects rise to the top so right yeah well thanks for kicking us off but um I know that we had some others that were hoping to share some stories um I don't know if we have the ability to identify them and unmute them or if there's any others in the room we can sure we have uh Greg Lamberg uh who just lead in Peterson Power Systems is a leader in providing clean backup solutions to load serving entities for Public Safety power shutoffs and Greg is there anything else you'd like to say on that in this uh in this webinar here I think this is a great discussion I think uh the uh the LJ presents some tremendous opportunities for all about the Pacific Northwest to uh to harden our uh our systems and and provide more resiliency for for customers um we are your local Caterpillar dealership throughout Oregon and uh over the last four or five years we've been providing a tremendous amount of uh backup solutions that run on renewable fuels to uh backstop Public Safety power shutoffs we provide uh over 100 megawatts annually in the summer to uh Pacific Gas Electric company that we locate in their uh substations throughout California we're starting to see more and more of this activity in Oregon and Southern Washington and uh if we could be of any help to uh the Northwest load serving entities please feel free to reach out to us and uh we'd be happy to help we hate hearing uh people going without power without water in the summertime and uh it's very easy to uh to deploy and uh uh solutions to uh to avoid those situations on the short-term basis thank you Greg thanks um I know that in the previous discussion yesterday um Christina you had some really good feedback on um some of the work for Community benefit indicators and I thought you made a really good point in terms of the um work that's happening um with the utilities in that space already and wanting to sort of learn from that but also recognizing that the different utilities are in different places and so this is a really good learning environment to sort of see what everyone's doing where the um where there might be some opportunities for alignment right so what we found you know clearly we're really engaged and involved in working on Community Development indicators related to hospital 2021s we've been working there but we also had experience in Washington and CEDA 2019 doing a similar effort and one of the key elements of that is building partnership and also creating Pathways for engagement and input by people that are absolutely affected and impacted by the fellow police decisions being made um the key point I was praying with me yesterday in space and I apologize for those of you that weren't there with that while there may be some I think maybe even mindsets sometimes that may create a limiting um perspective on how to move forward on community benefit indicators really I think there's some lessons to be learned by a very public process that a lot of for example that ious are going through as we kind of took us in people say Trailways down this path we're doing a lot of data Gathering we see census trap data we're using information around weather and statistics a lot of our we're leaving PSPs you know pre-experience right data collecting that we're using to even identify these vulnerable areas has been quite useful overlaying those on GIS maps taking a look at distribution system planning and then also surveying our question Community all of those pieces of information are helping us to deepen our lens in a way that operators really performed approach and how we weigh out the value proposition making a decision making an investment and it just so happens now a couple years down the line we have these provisional opportunities which would help alleviate a cost burden that is obviously socialized across our service districts by a potential reality Partnerships in these Brands but I can tell you today there's so many different challenges that a service that our communities are facing that truly are barriers to entry to receiving and Tech funding and actually being able to completely survey so it's everything from not being able to fund or have the investment capacity to have a technical survey then to even know what this scope would be to get the work done you know you're talking about undergrounding and I'm thinking about the permitting process I'm thinking about okay to put a thumper in that cost you're thinking about the time to get out there to do all the scanning and thinking about ground shifting and all the other things that don't have to happen right in the segments so um you know anything that we can do to maybe share some of that information and make it all live it's all available online and also just again recognizing the value of asking the community so if they need as well because there's some real significant wins out there that people are really willing to share they might even a lot of calls with us now and you always serve as something that is just I can't tell you how many times have been in rooms where I've said hey that's great people want to engage in this but guess what they don't qualify for alone or or you know yeah that money sitting there but there's a bear because they don't want to land or whatever it may be and people are awestruck because they cannot you know I thought there were some solutions oriented and focused and doing the right thing but everything these issues that were really you know creating additional constraints meanwhile there's a time constraints it's like if I was ever to make a recommendation on these these Awards it would be let's get flexibility constraints because you have vulnerable populations that have you know they need support they need the time to understand technically what's going to be needed and then from there build the capacity in order to accomplish the work and accomplish it in a way with groups and teens that are not going to who's going to say exploit the need right because sometimes when we remember you want to get something built we have all been overcharged before that happens and that's a negative outcome that really doesn't help Community it actually so one of the biggest things that I see you know with many government backed opportunities okay is that they don't give a waiver so like on you just like you said on your permitting process to go underground why would you need that as long as you're in the corridor that you had established why isn't there a waiver to be able to do that are all those bits yeah and that's you know so transmission is a major concern in the area Okay from where you have your resources to where your load is okay so oh okay well we're gonna let every hairy dick and whoever come into play in putting their opinion in on well wait a so your time frame from plan to construction has just now been put into the legal system and you know drawn out so where does your benefit go to you know you need it but we're letting everybody come in and you know stop it isn't the public good Factor come in as a waiver as to getting something implemented I don't care if it's coming through your neighborhood or not that's called imminent domain and use it you know but there's processes we uh Tom Thomas asked the question uh listening to the comment about permit timing will there be a time period for when to spend the money from Odo on a project I only ask because sometimes Federal permits like in Forest lands for underground and can take a year plus and Emily I'll we'll pivot over to you for a response on this thanks guys yeah absolutely so um at the point in time when we have our negotiations with the Department of energy finalized whenever that might be and we have our finalized award our period of performance is going to be initially five years and once we get to you know running our sub-granting process we'll be looking at probably about a four-year project period um and and although we have mentioned that there are allocations that will you know further this funding um and so we we could get extensions on that initial timeline and it could be up to 10 years but the initial period of performance we're looking at will probably be around four years another question along those lines but then the next step on that is going to end up being and I I realize I'm jumping way ahead here it's the reporting Criterion um that ends up happening and I'm sure you've",

increases in particular matter it was very signif iFly related to wood stove um old wood stoves and burning so the focus of the program then is to offer electric gas or pellet options to homes with older wood stoves and that provides the reduction in the wood smoke emissions um to help with those um maintaining attainment within the county as well as the health benefits of Clean Air so a few highlights from the wood stove um Exchange program um after 6 years of operations um the the emissions of par they prevented um emissions of particulate matter pollutants and gases Replacements um that amounts to over 311 um tons of reduction in the pm2.5 using the EPA Mission calculator um some specifics um 46 Point some specific reductions include 46.3 tons of pm2.5 and pm10 Emissions which are just particulate matter different they're different sizes and can cause different um human health issues um 264 tons of other pollutants 169 tons of carbon 47.4 tons of methane 41 tons of uh volatile organic compounds and six tons of hazardous air pollutants so you can see that um this Exchange program is making a huge um difference um to date the carbon dioxide emissions were also calculated it's a new calculation we're able to do and um carbon dioxide emissions that were prevented total 200 two over 2,000 tons so um the good news is Washington County has remained in attainment with the Clean Air standards since the Inception of this um program um however the concerning piece is that the EPA is planning a change in in the emissions threshold um in their current role Ru making process so the they're tightening the standards and the tighter standards could move the county closer to non-attainment stand status and local governments with nonattainment areas must develop imp implementation plans outlining how we will reach attainment and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions and this could mean strict requirements on existing industry in the region um and nobody knows exactly how far that region would expand that would really be up to the EPA um and um would expand their requirements to ex to um install as I mentioned before expensive emission control technology um therefore um we've included a request of 151,925 in gain share um funds to support continuation of the program in 2425 um and we also continue to receive revenues from um Intel the city of Hillsboro and some um small grants to to um maintain this program is there a place where we can understand the penetration rate or the success rate of the of the program yes um on the website is our most recent um uh annual report perfect so it's if you you have to go into to reports and you'll see it within the office of Community Development thank you and it's a lovely report report um quick questions is there any possibility that if the EPA does uh raise the bar on the Clean Air standards that there will be federal dollars or State dollars to help with a program like this or would that be another mandate that will be unfunded would wish well we that's a great question and we would hope so um we are constantly looking for opportunities to fund this program with other because the reality is is we're making a lot of progress on wood stoves um but there's still a lot of old stoves out there um but we also need to start addressing other um like um diesel fuel emission is another big contributor so we're always looking for opportunities for funding so uh chair Everton just announced commissioner Rogers has been online since 907 and he has his hand up for a question commissioner Rogers thank you and um morning great job of trying to go over a vast array of programs that you uh you offer I want to make one question on the I rais one point on the uh wood stove Exchange program and and stress why that's so important and then maybe ask a generalized question probably Tanya's going to have to get into it on the woods stove Exchange program for those who may say well what's that got to do with the county it's probably one of the biggest issues we have to keep our economic growth going about three and a half four years ago uh Nina deini who that name may not be familiar to any of you or to some of you came to me and said Roy you're not going to be entainment if you don't do something about your air quality uh what would that mean to this County that would mean that there would be uh some sort of an order placed how owners we don't know but it could stop all development and I'm not saying that strongly enough it could stop all development so the chips act any other issues that we might have uh we would be out of attainment and and mon said it very well with the measurement points there's a couple of them in Washington County and there's uh interesting ways that these partic articulant are measured and the scale keeps changing uh that would potentially be a economic disaster for us so uh I'm all unfavor of taking gain share money sip money whatever we need to take to make certain we're in compliance and it was found that the wood sto uh issue was was creating significant Hazard because of the bowl so that's that's my comment on the wood sto program uh my comment Marty on the general because I think you're at the end of your presentation and for Budget members I'm sorry I'm not there with you today this happens to be a huge filing tax deadline and so I have to kind of come on and off but uh you you've done a really good job of of running a number of programs not only when you were director but now in your new role as an assistant County Administrator in cobbling together funds to run programs most of them are uh financed through obviously outside sources but 's a good deal of uh transfers from the general fund there's a good deal of money that's from carryover funds and one of the budget members brought that issue up uh if our budget uh challenge is continue next year and the year after uh which you know it doesn't take any financial genius to look at how those are calculated those general fund amounts transfer amounts are going to be more challenging and it's going to be interesting how you're going to deal with the array of services that we all agree need to be provided but without the funding that's necessary to provide them so these aren't all federal and state dollars obviously they're local dollars as well and so uh one of the things that I think should be stated it's really policy more than the numbers because the numbers are the numbers you know what you have you have and which you got to spend you got to spend uh is what are you going to do the next couple of years and I know that's a board decision uh in terms of what they might be looking at for funding but what are you going to do for sustainability because if anyone looks at each and every one of the funds that you're dealing with it's predicated on past carryovers and general fund subsidies and I don't think that those can be maintained at the levels they are significant either changes in our Revenue base which means taxes or some uh some examination of our expenditures I mean that's just it's it's obvious reading the budget so that's a long long winded question but I I think there's a policy issue that I heard some budget members teasing out and it it I I'd like their perspective and I'd like yourp perspective so U budget committee Rogers let me jump in um as thank you for raising that just I I would say for air time um as you as budget committee members who are Board of Commissioners um know we we have been on a fin Financial journey and Discovery for the last several years um and we continue to look at what are Services who do they serve how are are they funded and why do we provide them currently the county is undergoing a service level assessment um the board will be uh receiving the first look at the progress on the service level assessment at their June 30th um work session this year's budget has reductions in the general fund that are considered discretionary when I use the word discretionary that does not mean the same as impactful so we have the need to continue to look at mandate Services as well as look at what is the risk of maybe not meeting mandates State mandates and maybe making choices in the future to not meet those mandated requirements because we don't have the funds and it is more impactful to use funds on what are considered discretionary services so this is a financial Journey that we're on uh your budget committee has heard uh from CFO Greg mun um just um the confines that we work within due to measure 5 and 50 yes it provides stable um uh property tax rates for community members yet our needs here in Washington County to S serve our diverse and growing Comm Community we we're stretched far beyond the capacity of our um of our tax structure Mr mun will has a few slides in tomorrow's presentation that he'll dive deeper into this as well as um the impact of compression so we will continue on this I uh want to point back to my budget message and waving that cautionary flag I still wave that cautionary flag um because the Board of Commissioners just heard um our first look at our facility condition index which looks comprehensively at Washington County existing facilities that's not new existing facilities and the significant deferred maintenance that we have you heard one building Animal Services there's many more buildings that we need to invest in so this year's budget provides that balanced approach of um yes cuts and still moving forward um with I will say amazing Services delivered by our amazing employees each and every day uh Financial sustainability is not gained in one year it is a multi-year approach and through our budget transformation in the commitment from the board of I'm confident that we are on that journey to Mr uh to commissioner Rogers uh Committee Member Rogers point there will have to be continued challenging um decisions um by the board um by the budget committee and also um by myself our department directors in ensuring yes meeting what our core um Service delivery is as a County government and also knowing the RO role that we play in livability for Washington County yeah just just to end on that I think um part of that Journey right will be looking at how can you attack the um unfunded and not completely funded mandates that",

        "text": " this review and I think that will help uh councelor IMS a lot in understanding what the issues are and then um if we still need some more time we you can ask for that and we'll get it so thank you okay okay back to okay thank you next please for the record Chase MC Bay um so during the DPO public comment period uh which was a 31-day comment period spanning May 7th through June 7th uh there was a public hearing held on May 30th and at the public hearing uh um four public commenters uh provide a testimony and one reviewing agency and we also received during thei prior to the deadline of the comment period we received two written comments one from one one being a public comment and one being of a reviewing agency and as I mentioned the certificate holder responded to all of the comments ments um this past Tuesday on June 11th and all of the comments and the reviewing agents uh and the applicants response to comments were provided to Council in the supplemental staff report um as an attachment to that staff report and in that supplemental staff report the department also uh to the best of our ability summarized the comments in a table which leads me to my next slide to the best of my ability I broke down the comments received and the issues raised into uh six issues there were comments related to vegetation management within the solar array and soil stabilization ground contamination from the solar ARR array reviewing agency coordination goal three exception justification and mitigation and the applicant's expertise and I'll try to address these topics when I get to their applicable standards and I'm not going to um well we can go to the next slide uh for this review of the DP I've chosen to um not review every single standard but present um the standards uh issues were raised in um were more unique in findings these uh standards on the screen the department doesn't anticipate any substantive changes from the DP to the proposed order um so that's why I've I've not I'm not I haven't included them in this slide deck that said if there's particular standards that you'd like me to address I can do my best today or if this agenda item is extended I can come back and present on it at the extended time in the future um counselor Byer thank you um Chase I just looking at your summary of issues we didn't receive public comments on these standards is that correct yeah correct thank you and there's standards that are not listed here that I have included because I thought they they were interesting but they didn't didn't have public comments but I thought that they were interesting nonetheless next slide please so we'll kick it off with expertise as I mentioned the app an for this proposed facility is Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC and it's a Project Specific LLC um and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of nexera energy LLC in their application the applicant um indicates that they will rely on the expertise of their parent company NeXT era and that next era has 175 energy in 36 States and four Canadian provinces as of year end 2019 next era subsidiaries operate FC already operate FC approved facilities um in Morrow County the wheat rdge renewable energy facility 2 Wheat Ridge renewable energy 3 state line one and two and that's not in Morrow I believe and vanle 2 wind facility you matilla sure councelor Byer thank you um I know maybe in the west solar or one of the other projects in either morrow or Umatilla County we asked for a letter from the developer showing the Nexus the relationship to the parent company and I don't recall if we have a similar condition on this project I can't remember which analyst worked on that project but I know that we got an extra um letter kind of Def guar I think it was I don't know if it's as strong as a guarantee but just establishing that relationship so if you could just check the conditions for organizational expertise you regarding organizational expertise and comments received on the record of the DPO there were multiple commenters that expressed their support for next era as a company as well as for the wagon trail solar project and those commenters and comments um with those comments the department doesn't recommend any changes be made to the proposed order it just was their support for for the company NeXT slide please oh since uh council member Grail is having audio issues um she texted me and said can we get a current number for the future um so going back to the slide so at the end of n 2019 is a while ago so curious to see if the numbers have grown or lost uh based on the facilities so that's something we can do um as well is make sure that we get the a more current number rather than 20197 correct okay the soil protection standard uh um this is on the DPO Pages 43 through 49 and this standard requires that counil find taking into account mitigation that the design construction and operation of a facility are not likely to result in a significant adverse impact to soils taking into consideration soil risks such as erosions and chemical spills in the application the applicant's evaluation of potential ad impacts considered the entire area of the solar array approximately 300 3,641 acres to be permanently Disturbed um and so this is going to relate to a comment we received including the O andm building substation areas and the battery storage areas the total area of disturbance uh would be 3,6 84.9 Acres at the public hearing we a a commenter Mr Krebs um commented on the record both an oral testimony and Via a rented a written handout and his comments related to um differing approaches to vegetation management within the solar array where one site appeared to use chemical application and a second used a vegetative management approach for long-term soil the department agreed that um agree the applicant did respond and the applicant's response was provided in the staff report and the the the department agreed with applicants respond that vegetation management applies across multiple standards fish and wildlife habitat land use and the Wildfire uh prevention and protection standards but the department disagreed that the vegetation management requirements of these plans is designed to protect soil and erosion potential within the facility fence line so as a result of Mr kreb's comment and and our evaluation of the applicants resp response the department is going to coordinate with the Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Agriculture on a vegetative vegetation management approach that address uh uh impacts within the solar array that are not permanently Disturbed areas um and so I think right now we would be recommending mending a new or an amended condition to be incorporated into the proposed order to ensure that long-term vegetation management that that a long-term vegetation management strategy be designed to ensure that site stabilization and soil protection for areas within the fence fence line um that are not occupied by permanent infrastructure so we would want to like we we foresee additional coordination with DEQ and a to come up with these strategies for areas within the fence line that were uh designated a permanent disturbance but don't o that but aren't occupied by actual infrastructure so like the areas between solar arrays like in the rows um specifically so that's like that's our that would be our recommendation in response to Mr kreb's comment would be further consultation with our sister agencies to come up with a strategy for these areas of non infrastructure and permanent disturbance okay um please yeah councelor Byer um so there'll be an ex if excuse me but I hope I have this right there'll be an explicit condition requiring that ongoing consultation with the Department of egg and Department of Quality I think that we would uh yeah for the record Todd cornet uh in response to the comment we're going to work with them now okay so this is not a permanent condition where we would work them with them throughout the life of the facility this was really response to the comments that we received to see do we have adequate findings or condition currently or should we make changes to those in the proposed order that's really what this is about so what what the outcome of that is is to be determined we haven't come to an absolute conclusion as to what changes should be made U that consultation with those agency has to has to Cur first okay so we would expect some kind of findings in the final order in the proposed order the proposed order thank you thank you that would reflect a a vegetative management strategy for these areas of non-impacted areas but within the fence line Mr McBay Walker um is this the first time that for solar arrays there's been uh an interest in trying to vegetate the non structurally impacted areas are we kind of breaking new ground here agrial volic or whatever I believe so yes I mean back there this is Sarah esterson senior policy adviser for the record um I mean the this particular issue was a very big issue for the obsidian solar center project because of the soil s and the erosion potential and the high value irrigated farms in proximity that project hasn't moved forward yet but we expanded like sight stability before disturbance and like anyway so we kind of we went there with that project again we haven't implemented it and then as um Chase's staff report sort of outlined I mean vegetation management within the fence line is addressed in part in under the wildfire mitigation standard but that's more about making sure it's like away and almost incentivizing gravel and and more be ground but we don't want that from an erosion soil perspective so and I mean a lot of the facilities that are moving forward which we actually don't have that many solar but um you know they're proposing sheep so we know that there's vegetation there we just don't know if it's being thought through from the perspective of sight stabilization um so that's where we're kind of going with it which is I mean we have a lot of guidance from what the 12200 seed does in terms of seeding with a a native seed and getting a certain level of cover before you say okay the site stable so we have some models to kind of work with with DEQ and and Department of a so it won't be mind-blowing I don't think what we come up with thank you Miss esterson will be yeah next slide please okay going into land use um the land use standard requires that Council find that a proposed facility complies with the Statewide planning goals Council may find compliance with Statewide planning goals if the",

        "text": " preconstruction construction operation and retirement and our compliance staff evaluate each one of these projects uh at least annually to ensure that it is complying with the um conditions of approval and you can see in the background slides sometimes bad things do happen uh with projects um so and that can take more time and more effort to kind of deal with those incidences that occur um and thirdly we have our own Ru making um program so the energy facility sighting Council has different rules than the Oregon Department of energy and the authority of those rules fall to the energy facility sighting Council so we have our own rule making coordinator and we have a pretty aggressive rule making program to uh evaluate different um either procedural or substantive rules on an annual basis to try to make our process more clear and better for all participants next slide so before a state jurisdictional facility can be built in Oregon the developer has to apply for a site certificate um but which facilities and what size of facilities come to the energy facility sighning Council are basically established through the definition um that it is in the statute that's on the slide so or 469 300 uh 11 defines energy facilities and the list of the facilities that are subject to FC jurisdiction um quite diverse um there is a lot of variation and each one of these standards or each one of these um projects or types of projects has thresholds um and I will get into some of the more significant ones that we're dealing with in the next couple of slides um and I do have a slide on battery storage which is not FC jurisdictional but there's been some there's some movement on that recently that's probably worth noting next slide please so over the past several years there has been some change in the thresholds related to solar um development so you can see on the slide um you have the location of where a project would be and since the majority of projects uh solar projects are excl are located on exclusive Farm use owned land the jurisdictional thresholds are really oriented towards productivity so the higher productivity the land for agriculture the quicker the smaller the project before it comes to the energy facility sighting Council so then you have high value being the most significant um farmable so think Eastern Oregon winter wheat would be kind of in that farmable area area and then really non farmable ground um could be based on soil type it could be a different Zone um and you can see prior to 2019 you know in order to come to the energy facility sighting Council the first two categories anything over 100 acres would come to us and then in the last one anything over 320 there's been a significant movement in the last uh few years so all the way till now um post 2023 legislative session in House Bill 3179 not a huge difference in high value still pretty small threshold before it comes to FC at 240 acres but now you can see on that farmable ground it's gone from 100 acres to essentially four square miles meaning local governments then have the ability to review projects up to four square miles on farmable ground and then non farmable ground around um local governments have the ability to review projects up to six square miles uh before it would automatically come to the energy facility sighting Council uh um do you see developers following those and staying with the counties or do they tend to default to um to the energy facility sighting committee more often than they may be required to yeah um the statutes allow for opting in by the developers so developers can opt into fsec even though they're less than these automatic thresholds um and then local governments primarily counties can have some ability to defer to FC thus far none have in either circumstances so we've yet to see that thank you next slide please all right so you can see this slide breaks down kind of uh these are only state jurisdictional these are not local government so I can't tell you exactly what the amounts would be for local government but for um FC jurisdictional facilities these are the numbers so the the first state solar project uh was approved in 2018 um and now really that's mostly what we're seeing there it's not entirely what we're seeing but mostly what we're seeing are new solar projects so you can see the total of active projects and this is you know under either in operation or currently under review um about 4.7 GW projects that are currently active um for FC um and then just for in information you know what is that equate to about 73 square miles of occupation you know the difference between they say Wind Facility and a solar facility is solar facilities are basically a fence line around the entire project and so it's entirely converted whatever it was it's now largely you know entirely um fence line around a solar facility where is wind projects you can farm right up to the base of the the wind turbine so quite a bit different in terms of the footprint impact um and then you can see the inactive one so since we started seeing solar projects uh we've already seen a couple either withdrawn or expired and in fact the very first project that was approved that I referenced in 2018 um that was um approved it had a three-year timeline to begin construction they didn't begin construction they requested a Time extension um they didn't build the project or begin construction within that second three-year time frame um and that project just expired so under their Amendment um after three years of approval they had indicated in their justification that they didn't have a power purchase agreement um and then at this point they've just let their project expire so some projects move forward um some move forward very quickly some don't and there's an example of one that didn't move forward next slide please all right so getting to the uh wind and transmission thresholds so at for for a Wind Facility um it would be 150 megawatts uh name plate capacity before it came to the energy facility s in Council so um and that's really you know each wind turbine has a uh maximum output on it so it would be the cumulative maximum output listed on each uh wind turbine so for example you know turbines are getting bigger and and producing more power and so if a project was proposed at four um with turbin at four megawatts each at 38 wind turbin it would become fsec jurisdictional just to give you an idea um and then transmission um so it's a it's all three of these so for a transmission line to be jurisdictional it would have to be greater than 10 miles equal to or greater than 230 KV and then also in more than one jur jurisdiction so all three of those have to be hit before it comes to to FC um next slide so I like this graphic because it kind of shows you going back in time you know the size increase of wind turbin so back in 2001 you know turbin were about 242 feet tall now they're 650 feet tall and you can see that sort of related to a couple of um you know the US Bank Tower in Portland at 536 and molten M Falls at 620 so these are quite quite significant projects in terms terms of the size or they are increasingly um but just sort of of Interest the energy facil sighting Council actually approved the first state jurisdictional wind project in 1983 so you know the review of renewable energy projects a lot of people think it's a fairly new thing but it's not so FC approved its first Wind Facility in 1983 this was in Curry County um there were a lot smaller wind turbines at the time it was never actually constructed um and the approval expired um but you know the history of it goes back um quite a ways so now you can see the total amount of active projects about 3.5 gws of wind and then over the you know primarily since the early 2000s the number of projects that have either um been approved and let their ex let their um approvals expire or withdrew or built less than what was entirely approved almost equals what is actually active about 3.5 gaw of wind energy so that gives you an understanding next slide please so um getting into the battery storage question so battery storage is not FC jurisdictional by themselves so the Standalone battery storage wasn't and is still not FX jurisdictional but just about every project we have now has a battery component um so a new wind project a new solar project or even amendments to add um solar to wind typically always includes battery storage so you can see in terms of the active amounts of battery storage about four and a half gws of battery storage is currently active most of that is currently under review um a little bit is as operation um but the majority is under review um and during the last legislative session um House Bill 415 was approved previously battery storage wasn't even defined in statute um and so I think there was a kind of a lack of clarity about what the regulatory path is I think there's still some work needs to be done on that but um currently based on that that bill passing uh battery energy storage systems are defined they're defined in FC jurisdictional statutes but they're not um by nature or by by definition FC jurisdictional but they can opt into FC that was what the development Community had advocated and that's ultimately what was passed and Todd when they are Standalone um on agricultural lands is there do you happen to know if they're um a conditional use in agricultural lands yeah I has to go through permitting thank you chairman Donal yeah I think um it's not clear um but I think what everybody anticipates is that it would not be a conditional use um that it would be in excuse me for getting into land use a little bit but there are two categories of uses allowed with an exclusive Farm use own type one or sub one and then type two or sub two the first category sub one uses um have very few standards that are specifically listed in statute and then the sub two uses are conditional uses um I believe that everybody anticipates that a standalone battery energy storage system would be a utility facility necessary for public service which is a sub one use great thank you but it's not but it's not explicit so I think there will probably likely be future legislation to help further Define that um next slide please so mentioned that um the FC process is a standards based review I'm not going to go through any of the",

        "text": " and elevating the stuff that's good candidates for one particular funding stream that EPA is available then after we get done with that round of activity we go back to create the comprehensive climate action plan which is in this middle area in blue that's calling on us to broaden the scope and think about all greenhouse gas emissions in the region not just the ones that are well captured in our current plans and come up with a plan to reduce them it's a really great opportunity because we don't have that type of comprehensive Regional climate action plan for the region right now EPA has told us that they plan to make or condition other Federal funding sources uh so that the projects that are included in these comprehensive climate action plans are prioritized but they haven't shared any details about that which is why that second green ball showing the other Federal climate funds that might come at the end of the comp of climate action plan to implement those projects that's a little fuzzy because I don't have much information about what that looks like yet finally after we complete this comprehensive climate action plan in summer 2025 we have two years of status reporting where we're just updating EPA on the status of the actions including in these plans and on any uh on any implementation actions that have move forward out of these plans so I think the big thing that's really been interesting to grasp about this is this is normally we think about the visions and the policies and the data and the needs first and then we get down to some specific projects this process has really required us to reverse that and start with the projects that are ready to move ahead and then go back and do the bigger picture plan so another thing that adds to the complexity of this project is that Metro is not the only agency with one of these planning grants that affect R region um so the state of Oregon so this map is showing all the different cprg planning grantees across the country all states that have received a grant are shown in yellow all Metro areas that have received a grant are shown with a red dot and what you'll notice is that both the states of Oregon and Washington have also one of the same grants that we've received and what that means is that um projects in our region can move forward for implementation funding not only based on the plan that Metro creates but also based on the plans that depending on which side of the river they're on either Oregon or Washington create and so we're coordinating actively with the states to make sure that we support and don't duplicate each other with this process so that we position agencies and get to bring home as much money as possible off of these implementation grants okay so I've just mentioned a really confusing list of different plans and funding opportunities that are at play with this grant so I'm going to walk through some slides to try to show how they all overlap um we began this process before we began this process there were already a lot of climate action plans in the region Washington County had its own plan communities like baverton within Washington County had its plan Metro had a transportation emissions reduction plans so even before we started this grant we had kind of a big landscape of both of climate action plans that were both at the local and Regional and at the state level this first plan that we've been working on the priority climate action plan or pcap um you know starts with those that existing Universe of plans and focuses on the strategies that are identified in those plans that are particularly well aligned with the cprg implementation grants and other near-term funding opportunities so those plans are going to focus on a subset of what's in you know the broader set of climate action plans in our region they're really align with these implementation grants and then once these plans are done on March 1st Metro or other agency partners in the region can apply for cprg implementation grants to implement an action that's either in the regional plan or in one of the state plans so that's an orange because that's the next milestone for the grant and then the other next milestone for the grant that I'm discussing with you today is these longer term plans the comprehensive climate action plans which are the next deliverable under our grant and those are an opportunity finally to identify all the other projects that stand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our area whether they were captured already in the plans that we did or whether they're new ideas and think about how we might line those up for so it's been a quick process and we've learned a lot um here's some of the things I want to highlight this process is really about looking at projects that are implementation ready and effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in particular that implementation Readiness has been an important frame in terms of narrowing down what we want to focus on here because there are a lot of great ideas in the region about how to reduce emissions and some of them are further along than others and this has been a chance to elevate those um at the same time as we review all the plans that you know we're drawing from to create this one we from the local climate action plans really very widely and that's a barrier to taking the type of collective action that EPA is asking for the most significant greenhouse gas reduction opportunities are in transportation residential Energy Efficiency and waste management these are areas where the region already does a lot of coordination and where existing climate action plans highlight that local governments are already doing things that can be scaled up with an implement ation Grant and that work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions finally uh no surprise here but there isn't enough even though this is a really significant opportunity with this these upcoming cprg implementation grants there isn't enough funding in that or in other pots to support all the climate needs and opportunities we have in the region especially because agency individual agencies have to apply to leag Grants and applying for a Federal grant takes a lot of work and our agency partners have limited capacity to apply so in our PRI in our priority climate action plan these are the strategies that we're focusing on I'm not going to walk through these in all in a lot of detail I'll say that they contain a lot of Transportation related actions not because transportation is necessarily more important than the other issues but because that's an area where we already have a lot of coordination through tables like wccc or like jpack and Tac at Metro and so we're able to identify Transportation actions in a lot of detail rather than showing you rather than focusing on this list which is what's eligible to apply for Grant I'd rather give you an update on what's actually underway and applying for these implementation grants um so in February 1 notices of intent to apply were due for implementation grants for cprg implementation grants and here's a list of projects that submitted a notice of intent to apply um it includes a triet project to Electrify buses uh triat Metro project to uh redesign signalization on certain high capacity Transit quarters and keep buses moving through traffic more quickly uh and notice of int gression improved to add composting capacity a Metro application to fund Energy Efficiency and affordable housing units that we build through our Transit oriented development program and though it's not shown on this slide because it uh it I uh because uh there wasn't a notice of intent to apply submitted I do know that staff in Washington County uh have been leading an effort in coordination with other counties to explore an application that provides energy efficiency retrofits in publicly managed affordable units so what's next for this process we're working to finalize this priority climate action plan support and coordinate with our partners in developing these implementation Grant applications that are due on April 1st and then once we get those implementation Grant applications in we're going to Pivot to developing this comprehensive climate action plan which may and thinking about what additional climate strategies we want to focus on in that plan that we didn't that that weren't highlighted in this first plan that we're creating so here the questions I'm interested in discussing with you today um interestingly want to make sure everybody knows about this process and absolutely want to answer any questions folks have about the approach and also really curious for your input on the comprehensive climate action plan and what things we should focus on that are going to really uh be important to supporting y'all in Washington County in meeting your goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as we prepare to scope out that that the next round of the of this grant so I'll drop us out of sharing and paste these uh uh questions as well as my email address in the chat right questions for Elliot May Callaway you're muted okay you may regret that you told me that that's probably true my my question um you know going back to and in our packet I didn't have um a copy of you know the the financial requests I just had the priority strategies and um I guess I'm I'm confused as to why expanding the use of parking pricing you know seems to rate higher in the score than electrifying Transit fleets because it seems to me that electrifying primate buses um and smart down in Wilsonville and wherever else you know really would have a much bigger impact than expanding the use of parking pricing around Washington County and I had a question another question you know support res uh weatherization and efficiency upgrade in existing and in new affordable housing well shouldn't new affordable housing already have those efficiency upgrades in them so that we're not having to come back afterwards and um and doing those upgrades in new affordable housing um that to me just seems like you know loow hanging fruit so um I'm just really mystified by you know the scores who judged and who who what the criteria was for the scores you know who scored it and everything else um in some ways it feels like more of a priority for spending than it does a priority for reducing greenhouse gases wow so great questions mayor K I really appreciate this so those screening criteria that are reflected in that file mem I'm happy to follow up with more information about those those were developed by our Consulting team um and shared out with this climate Partners Forum over the course of two successive meetings they were designed to reflect the um criteria that EPA is putting in it's uh in the implementation Grant applications we wanted to align with the implementation Grant criteria so that we could be telegraphing which projects were likely to be competitive when EPA opened up these implementation grants and you know it's definitely more art than science in some cases because the evalu the implementation Grant notice of funding",

Thanks I was able to meet the mayor of a city there in the fall and his hands are full. now thanks for the comment does anyone have more comments councilor Yes thanks just I want to thank the city manager Brian Marton for fixing the lights at Beverly and Lancaster that was very important the truck drivers were calling me saying I'm standing here at this light four in the morning turns out to be broken thanks to the Office we saw the parties in the national parks night out Officer Gil answered the public safety and personnel questions and he personally answered the payroll tax questions I went to the Mckey part very well attended I have a memory there and there were very nice Oaxacan dancers a great job to Diana Garc\u00eda from Nova live and also Christine butter for the system they have I also attended the Inglewood Forest festival and I was impressed I had no idea it was the First time I arrived at the park and I had never been, truly a magical place, they do a fantastic job of communicating and publishing this event very well, announcing it, there to buy pizzas because we ran out of food in the Chepeto truck. In other news, I stopped to see to a person to see a person who is living in a tree people the neighbors have called me because he is not wearing clothes from the waist down his name is Michael he is over 60 years old he has injected eyes I tell him it is very hot and he says I'm fine, I don't need help, nothing from shelter, nothing about facing cold or anything, I asked him to take care of himself and put on clothes. This week's action item is to meet the neighbors. So we are going to change, we are going to take care of ourselves, we have to find out which association. We belong to neighbors and I invite you to attend the meetings Thank you counselor, does anyone else have comments counselor norday Hello everyone, good afternoon How nice to be here at City Hall with air conditioning with so much heat I like to go from my air conditioned car to the car that has air conditioning and to my office that is already here but we have many residents in Sal that do not have the fortune of this and I want to recognize that the cooling units that are going to be available for the people in the city and also recognize all the outdoor workers who have to work in these conditions, I invite all employers to do what they can To support and protect their employees in these triple-digit temperatures, the city of Sale is home to many agricultural workers, even if protections are approved on days of high temperatures. triple digits there is a lot that these communities can do by working in places that do not have the benefit of air conditioning and I am not talking about greenhouses but also Bin dairy farms agricultural operations we have many citizens and low-income people who do not They have air conditioning. I know that every year the Silen housing area works with the workers to ensure that the air conditioning of low-income older adults is more at risk due to their age since the heart must work extra to maintain the body. cooler So this is a health hazard if you in your neighborhood Or you know of a neighbor who has a special need it would be a very good idea to go see if that neighbor is let's show them support now the cooling shelters the next ones are going to be open this week artist mission Instagram Community Center the autrich communica center of poco the public library and the center fifty blogs will be open so that they can be in a cool place if they have some time and are interested in volunteering there will always be a need I know that There are homeless contact teams that go into the forest because people go into the forest to check to see if they can take them to a cooling center at no charge to them so my heart and gratitude goes out to all the volunteers who walk in those conditions right now to talk to people who live outside to see if they are in a position to remain alert under the conditions of this week I just wanted to comment I'm changing the subject on the weekend I participated in a parade but not on the streets of the city of Selene but on the streets of the city of Kaiser I say this because my place of business is in Kaiser and I have really enjoyed meeting the people, the businesses, the service providers and other residents that make Kaiser a great honor and I had the honor of marching with a group called punks with a purpose and perhaps known as Pons in the park, which by the way is spelled punks with x p or NX, there are many young people at risk. They have five different hair colors. They have five tattoos on their faces. and they need people to communicate with them by speaking their language and this is where Ponce in the park gets to interact, works with trauma and other types of things so not only were we able to march in the streets of Kaiser with a Rock Punk group all along the River Trail we were able to promote their annual event and resource fair So this is a free event open to the public on September 16th which falls on a Saturday at the Park This is going to be free free food for the youth free clothing for young people six bands ready an outdoor concert and we can see where they meet and celebrate Who they are so I invite you to get familiar with these organizations they do outstanding work and represent the heart for young people Thank you does anyone have any comments very good there is no proclamations today or presentations no one signed for public hearings we are already on the agreed calendar it is approved second and the one promoted for being pent\u00f3n seconded by nicheca we have three points three point one A which are the minutes of the seventeenth of July in three point one B which are the minutes of July twenty-four, 2023 and also point three point two a is the acquisition of property for the street at the intersection of twenty-fifth street for the improvement project is all any comments take the roll call vote in favor of Nichoca good in favor Gonz\u00e1lez in favor in favor no in favor Barney in favor in favor mayor Joy in favor the motion is approved very well we do not have public hearings point five a was withdrawn point five B councilor norac Thank you very much so I present my motion which is identical to last time regarding the creation of a Tom Hole hearing for Salem and for districts two three four and seven second that motion very well moved by northday seconded by Gwen thank you I'm glad we're having an opportunity to reconsider this what I want to do is encourage conversation and listen to my parents but first I want to present this first the concept of a Salem Town Hall is so that we can talk about the issues that impact Sao for the four city councilors that we represent at that time we know that The neighborhood associations have specific questions about intersections",

        "text": " all right thank you one one other thing this is ken it might be that some of the response from what do i want to say here the the the applicant i guess will do maybe not wanting to annex to the district is because we're talking what 4 000 some acres but and that would that could be a big price tag to annex uh to the fire district possibly i don't whereas the structural fire protection would be just a portion a small portion of that area a contract for services with that fire district might be a lot or something that they could uh as opposed to annexing the entire boundary of the yeah so what you're recommending is um that that would be an ore or or a contract for structural protection yeah i i think that's i think that gets at you know what my concern was is structural protection going to rely on sarah to help me with these notes to address what i think um i think we want to be able to move forward and i think that maybe we'll con this and council will proceed maybe through jesse's presentation and then maybe we can bring this back up which means we would i'm i'm a little bit unsure let's just let's just continue forward maybe sarah can look at this or maybe we just uh take a break before i move on to the next what do we hey kellen why don't we move forward because i think you can kind of conclude the rest of it relatively quickly and then when we get to essentially the you know straw poll on the material change we can defer that either you know before jesse starts if there's enough information because we're going to need to take a break here pretty soon or if we need to we can go through jesse's presentation and before the material change hearing we can move back to this okay um thank you this is good good feedback um under the council's waste minimization standard the council must find that the applicant would minimize the generation of solid waste wastewater um and that managed would be our waste would be managed in which the department recommends waste minimization condition one which has measures for recycling reusing um segregating materials from hazardous or non-hazardous um and collection of uh of waste any comments on the waste minimization uh there's the signing standards for transmission lines um this has a nexus a mandatory condition um listed or imposed underneath the general standard of review that requires the applicant to develop and implement a program that provides assurance that you know fences cattle guards trailers anything that could be inadvertently charged would be grounded um but to further reduce the risk of induced current nuisance shocks the department recommends recommended sighting standards for transmission line which requires um property owners uh within a half mile i believe 500 feet um of the transmission line to be provided a map of potential um safety issues with induced currents this is the only standard that is uh or condition that's recommended under the standard any questions under uh other applicable regulatory requirements which has this nexus with the general standard of review which requires the preponderance preponderance of evidence on the record supports that the applicant to demonstrate that they can meet the council standards but also other applicable laws um that apply to the app the that would apply to the site certificate underneath this and council's familiar that council reviews and offers decisions on the interpretation and compliance with the oregon department of environmental qualities noise rules for industry and the deq does not administer or fund um in any involvement or um implementation of its noise rules however they still are rules that are on the books that apply to council's facilities so noise generated by a new industrial or commercial source located on a previously unused site which is the applicants considering this to be a previously unused commercial or previously unused site so it's a new industrial commercial source they must comply with two deq noise standards and one is the maximum allowable noise standard and then the other is the ambient noise degradation both of these standards represent allowable noise levels at real properties normally used for sleeping and we refer to those as noise sensitive the deq noise rules list exemptions one of these exemptions specifically exempts noise caused by construction activities construction noise um is not um you know or it's basically exempt from that maximum allowable and from the ambient degradation standard so those standards don't apply to construction noise um and of note there is often noise that's associated with construction one of the noises that would be most apparent from construction is that they propose that they're going to use a pneumatic pile um to kind of pound in the solar posts and so this kind of could be a loud repetitive sound associated with construction so but the evaluation provided here underneath the the noise rules and the construction related noise evaluation in the proposed order is also relied upon under the um recreational resources standard and protected areas where construction noise associated with the construction and operation of the facility is also included in that so based on the applicant rep applicant representations the department recommends uh council impose recommended noise condition one which would reduce the potential impacts associated with noise construction and this provides a noise complaint response system um which includes notification to nearby residents of certain construction locating noise generating equipment away from residences and the time restrictions for the use of that pneumatic pile the ambient noise degradation standard uh associated with operational noise requires a demonstration that noise generated during operation must not cause the ambient hourly l10 and l50 noise levels at any noise sensitive property to exceed 10 dba above the ambient noise levels and this is the ambient is based on measurements from a particular location on um property to establish kind of a baseline or the ambient uh noise so the applicant identified 17 noise sensitive properties uh by using aerial photographs and on-site inspections to determine what is a residential structure um so that it's not like a uh gear shed or something would not be considered a um noise sensitive property because it would not be normally used for sleeping normally um noise generating equipment equipment that the applicant included in its noise assessment um includes the solar array inverters and transformers the substation and the battery system inverters and cooling systems so this is all the noise generating equipment i have a figure here that kind of has this sound sound levels radiating out here this is so um this here has like the most noise would be generated from the substations and then noise as it attenuates or moves outward reduces so based upon the applicant's noise analysis and noise contour maps the maximum increases in ambient noise from the proposed facility operation would not exceed 9 dba so therefore the ambient noise degradation standard would not be exceeded which is basically over 10 so um and so would not be exceeded at any noise sensitive property during maximum operation and rainy conditions so they would not exceed this standard so yes additionally the applicant's noise modeling results show that noise generated during operation would not exceed the maximum allowable standard of 50 dba at any noise sensitive property because the maximum statistical noise levels were modeled at 34 dba which is less than 50. so the maximum allowable standard would not be exceeded uh to afford the department the ability to verify compliance with the deq noise rules um because we because under the ambient um it was at a at a nine um a dba increase of of nine um the department um recommends noise condition two which required the submission of a summary noise report which would basically present the sound power levels of the equipment that they actually uh select based on final design um that is what i have to say about the det noise rules and are there any other um applicable regulatory requirements for this facility are um the oregon removal fill law um which is administered by the oregon department of state lance or dsl um the proposed facility describes that there's 35 non-wetland playas which are kind of these seasonally flooded lake that are within the site boundary there's no wetlands um or other waters of the state but playas are considered waters of the state and subject to regulation by dsl so the evaluation is whether or not a removal fill would be required the applicant represents that only the social solar module rack support posts would be installed in these playa areas and that the estimated removal fill impact would be 14 cubic yards which is less than 50 yards and so um the there would not be a removable fill permit um governed by the council at this time and that's what i have for removal fill under the general standard of review as we've made note the council has to find that there's compliance with other statutes and administrative rules which would also include the oregon water resource department um rules that uh that administer and cover water rights and water permits or water right transfers and if there was a water permit a water transfer or a surface water permit that permit would be included in the council's jurisdiction and governed by the site certificate so the department recommends counsel wait oh this is my okay i do have this okay sorry um there's two conditions that the department underneath this other applicable regulatory requirements water rights and water use are related to contested case issue nine so jessie is going to kind of dive into those more i do provide a table here that is pro that is provided in um the water rights section which designates the annual water usage for the facility now they did represent kind of going back to that public services that it would take um up to two years to construct the facility and under worst case um this is a worst case scenario um for those two years for construction it would be about 34 gallons of water over that period of time the applicant states that it would purchase water from the christmas valley domestic water supply district water existing water rights from that district and the applicant provided permit in the application and then the department coordinated with water resource department to confirm those and other permit numbers um that that the water district could provide the water under um the applicant also says that it could possibly get water from um the the city of la pine um and then that was is limited to that representation so this corresponds back to public services and there is a letter from the water district saying that under um you know average circumstances that they would be able to provide the water however the applicant may need to have a water service provider the applicant is representing that it would also like uh it would also construct on up to two on-site wells um that would uh help provide water for the construction and operation of the um the let's uh a water resource department",

        "text": " lands is there do you happen to know if they're um a conditional use in agricultural lands yeah I has to go through permitting thank you chairman Donal yeah I think um it's not clear um but I think what everybody anticipates is that it would not be a conditional use um that it would be in excuse me for getting into land use a little bit but there are two categories of uses allowed with an exclusive Farm use own type one or sub one and then type two or sub two the first category sub one uses um have very few standards that are specifically listed in statute and then the sub two uses are conditional uses um I believe that everybody anticipates that a standalone battery energy storage system would be a utility facility necessary for public service which is a sub one use great thank you but it's not but it's not explicit so I think there will probably likely be future legislation to help further Define that um next slide please so mentioned that um the FC process is a standards based review I'm not going to go through any of the details of these but this lists the 16 General standards that apply to every project now the applicability of these standards you know sort of modulates based upon the project and the location of the project so they don't all have to meet the same sort of level of justification to meet each standard it really depends upon the circumstances so you know if you're in an industrial Zone in an urban area your fish and wildlife standard is going to be pretty easy to meet but if that you know a different project in pristine habitat could impact you know significant Wildlife it's going to be a much higher burden and a lot more effort that's going to need to be uh met so I'm not going to spend any time on this other than to say you know we we work with you know our our reviewing agencies the state agencies local governments tribal governments and we rely upon them heavily to help us where we don't have the sub subject matter expertise in some of these areas uh next slide please and then briefly I'll just run through our process so there are seven main steps in our process starting at the notice of intent really that's a high level overview the applicant must submit you know about a 100 pages of desktop level analysis of what the project they're proposing and where um and then we send that out for public comment we have a public information meeting in the vicinity of the project uh we seek input you know from the public from the reviewing agencies we do our own analysis and based upon that we issue the project order which is really just a set of standards that that particular project has to meet what are the analysis area distances how far do they have to evaluate the project per standard um you know in terms of what needs to be submitted in application then they have two years within which to submit a preliminary application we evaluate that to determine whether it's complete or not and a complete application just means that we have enough information to review the project not necessarily to recommend approval um and so we work heavily with the um reviewing agencies when we're reviewing it for completeness once it's deemed complete we also provide notice we have another public information meeting in the vicinity of the project to try to prepare the public to participate in the next step which is the draft proposed order and that's functionally a report it is the department makes an analysis of does that proposed project meet each standard or not so we have findings of fact conclusions of law conditions of approval um we provide notice of that we have a public hearing that public hearing is in person in front of the council in the vicinity of the project um and so we we get comments on you know how did we do what are you thinking uh based on those comments we make adjustments to that which is then the the Department's second recommendation in the form of the proposed order um and we've made adjustments to any findings conditions and then ultimately it goes to a contested case so each application has a mandatory tested case where the energy facility sighting Council appoints an independent hearing officer who runs that and so we the department are a party the applicant is a party to that and then any of the members of the public who commented at the draft proposed order stage if they commented and they're still not satisfied that their issue was evaluated and resolved they can request that issue be evaluated in that contested Case by that third party hearing officer and then ultimately I'm not going to go through the steps in that but there are a whole set of steps associated with that contested case then once that's concluded the the Department's proposed order and then any evaluation that's done by that hearing officer on those issues goes to the council for their final decision so they evaluate everything on the record they make their own final decision and if the project um meets all of the standards then they approve it and then they issue a site certificate and what I don't have on the slide is is the appeal path so um by Statute the appeal path for a final decision of the energy facility sighting Council goes directly to the Oregon Supreme Court and they have six months within which to issue their final decision the reason being is the uh the record is really complete at that point in time because the only issues that are eligible to be challenged are in the contested case and there's a pretty complete record that was established by the hearing officer that's what gives them that six-month time frame within which to issue a decision U and just to give you an example so the Boardman Hemingway project um had a lot of parties in the contested case I think it ended up having I think three or four parties who appealed to the Supreme Court on a host of issues and even with that huge record the Supreme Court issued their final decision in four months rather than six months um and that was really I think a function of the record Being as complete as it was uh next slide please so I'm not gonna really spend much time on this just more of a reminder and I know uh or I found out recently you you did receive uh a a uh overview of the Oregon renewable energy sighting assessment tool this is just a plug to say please go check it out it's a great tool it has a lot of value you can do pretty significant assessments of you know a particular location whether it's a good solar or wind resource what are the potential implications based upon um different resources um that are out there um it's a very sophisticated tool it also includes these State jurisdictional energy facilities the boundaries of those as well so um just encourage you all to take some time uh and play around with the tool it's uh it's a great tool and then my last slide is you know this was a pretty quick um overview um I could spend an entire day going through our process which nobody really wants but that being said is I'm happy to answer any questions you have um or come back at any point in time you know if you want further details on any parts of process thank you Todd um are there any quick questions for Todd or comments from Commissioners or um directors or legislators about the process and Senator demro has a question excellent Senator demro yeah thanks KY Todd thank you for very much for this overview um one of the bills that was proposed this year that didn't make it through was House Bill 4090 uh that um it passed in the house and then it came to the Senate and didn't um wasn't addressed in the committee or didn't come out of committee and it would have um uh avoid allowed developers to avoid the um the FC process for projects that were in Federal land and had to go through the NEPA process and um this was actually an issue that our environmental caucus was split over and um one of the uh one of the concerns was that um the NEPA process could change you know depending on what happens at the federal level uh the FC process is one one that we have control over and so there was um more confidence in that uh but obviously the the push for making this change was to try to expedite the process for developers and avoid duplicate unnecessary duplication um and so I wonder if you could just say say something about how um in a situation like that EPC would coordinate with the NEPA process to avoid duplication I mean is this a a serious problem as you as you see it because I suspect this bill will come back and just to prepare us for that um thank you Senator demro um what I will say is or I'll start with is within the FC statutes there is mandatory language that requires you know FC or at least the department of energy on behalf of FC to coordinate with any federal partners that are also doing a review so we have a statutory mandate to minimize duplication by coordinating you know with the lead Federal agency in a NEPA process to use information where we can um so the NEPA process is not the same as the FC process um so but we do have the requirement to coordinate with with you know our lead Federal agency to minimize any duplication of materials that are submitted that could be used to meet an FSX standard as well as a Nea requirement so we have that mandate and the in the code of federal regulations lead federal agencies for NEPA process also have that mandate to coordinate so we have that requirement you know we've done projects the Borman Hemingway project there was a lot of coordination between the department and the Bureau of Land Management who was the lead Federal agency uh when I first got to the department I was the lead on the Cascade Crossing project that was a um Portland General Electric had proposed a project from bardman to Salem um they got through the application and then withdrew that project but there was significant amounts of coordination um between us and the forest service who was the lead Federal agency so we have experience we do that I think one of the things just you know to kind of respond that I didn't see during that bill any evaluation any testimony there was C some discussion but nobody had conducted any kind of evaluation to say what is the fsec process what are the standards what is the Nea process what are the requirements what is duplicated what is not duplicated I think people kind of generically said it's the same and it's the same kind of requirements and it really isn't there is a significant amount of difference in terms of ours being a standards based and NEPA being an impact based",

        "text": " from Odo on a project I only ask because sometimes Federal permits like in Forest lands for underground and can take a year plus and Emily I'll we'll pivot over to you for a response on this thanks guys yeah absolutely so um at the point in time when we have our negotiations with the Department of energy finalized whenever that might be and we have our finalized award our period of performance is going to be initially five years and once we get to you know running our sub-granting process we'll be looking at probably about a four-year project period um and and although we have mentioned that there are allocations that will you know further this funding um and so we we could get extensions on that initial timeline and it could be up to 10 years but the initial period of performance we're looking at will probably be around four years another question along those lines but then the next step on that is going to end up being and I I realize I'm jumping way ahead here it's the reporting Criterion um that ends up happening and I'm sure you've heard um numerous comments across the board that it's not just the application process we uh we have 16 total employees um and and the burden of not only the application process than is internal uh the reporting is also internal and that's just Addy to the job responsibilities on that side so the only request I've ended up making is um the countless meetings and it doesn't matter if it's from broadband um grants is is the reporting requirements we have to hold people accountable there's there's no doubt about that if you have been great you mean to be held accountable for what you're doing the the depth and breadth of that though can be burned some to the point of debilitating where you don't want the award or you don't want them a war because then you're spending all of your time yeah or having to review and go through steps yes okay I'll give you an example we Parry Emperors got a word era okay this was six seven years ago or something or maybe even though but uh the reporting requirements you know is based on the agent that you get out of the agency also you know and they can make your life you know rather unpleasant as to requirements and detail and you know I'm stuck that is like a no-brainer as to the expenditure that you had you know so I do understand that and that involves a lot of my time which is also needed for a lot of other things and up here we have a staff of three and yeah so yeah we are going to try to one build all of those reporting requirements very transparently into these performance agreements with our subtle warnings or the grantees um we have a couple of really excellent Grant federal grants staff in our office right now and we are going to really strive to streamline all the strings attached to this money and hopefully come up with ways to minimize the burden of that reporting maybe we can create templates that are easy to fill out and um you know one of the things with these federal dollars is when you get the award there's a certain expectation for what you're going to be doing with it and it's checking the boxes and if you go off the rails in any way it can raise these flags and it just everything comes grinding to a halt so we're going to work to help with that reporting side of it with our agency and we'll have our growing pain certainly as we go but we're going to try to build it into our contracts and help with that as much as we can because I hear you I think one of the major ones for is the Davis bank account the reason why I bring the clap is because usually reservations do not like okay so the labor force on reservations aren't Union and so then when you're trying to help a hey remember the justice 40 area you know well are you excluding them from the workforce because then you're because that's aimed at unions okay so now you say well you don't have to belong to the union to get paid well that's correct but now you still have the reporting requirements as to the weekly payroll and blah blah blah and then having to look at the for your area you know you know and you're like the compliance issues involved in that is overwhelming you know yeah that was one of the areas you know so how do you make that simpler well that's a legislative and but definitely a area of concern for any award recipients question so with all the all there's the federal stuff that people have applied for it some of those projects are big you know they're potentially big if you're awarded it like upgrading transmission line you that sort of thing and you're hardening it it's the grid resilience it's got other benefits because it's you know Wildfire protection because it's steel Tower instead of wood all that sort of thing so there's Community benefits there for that is the state considering any sort of Partnership if something has already been submitted in a different venue because of the magnitude of dollars being spent that are required or is that you know we haven't had a real discussion about how this might stack on other federal employment projects um and Emily may know different but as far as I know that's not prohibited obviously you could use the federal funds from one to batch the other so there are some some common sense um things that we would have to follow um in general with the programs that we've been working on at Odo including the sister program the community renew mobile energy ground program we're trying to see how the program can leverage additional funds okay um this one because it's Federal money I'm not sure exactly how that works but we can look into it um and I can see how if you have a big project and there's a smaller piece you could carve out of the bundle with this one as long as it met all those requirements I think but we could probably do that it would have to describe it fully unto itself in this program and showing the the funds are coming from so we you know we need those rash requirements well it certainly demonstrated the partnership you know because you've got the department of energy that's seeking bold and Japanese the state certainly has theirs and they're compatible and so um it makes sense that we need to consider it really that's a really good point and just to connect some feedback that we received in yesterday's session as well I think there was discussion around kind of creating criteria around you know what the impact of this funding would allow it to do so if there's a case to be made that by giving this portion of funding it will also gain you access to these portions of funding in order to do these broader projects that might be um that's something that could be weighted so I think there was discussion around that yesterday as well great and Emily did you want to expand on that at from your perspective um I was just gonna kind of piggyback off of what Rob was saying a little bit in that I think it's a really great question and it is a big priority that the department of energy specifically has talked a lot about with all of these federal funds in that they're using the term braiding so um if you have the opportunity to apply for and receive several different sources of funding through the department of energy there is definitely going to be an emphasis and an Applause for you know using these funds the best of your ability and to braid them together in ways that make um the one thing that I would just caution is making sure that you're kind of following those requirements whatever they might be specifically built into each grant for example one thing might be um you cannot use federal funds from one pot of money to cover your match requirement on this pot of money so things like that are going to be things to consider thank you I don't want to break up this conversation but I know the criteria will also have a lot of room for discussion as well so in the interest of time maybe we move forward and yeah again if there's anyone virtually who has comments please keep adding them you know we will find ways to get to them as moving forward okay yes we can move this along and come to that next slide be able to talk a little bit about how the how the process works and the the review process and so what we have here is a um kind of a schematic of the methods of a war that we plan to use and this process flow is very similar to the community renewable energy grab program that we already have running in the photo and Our Hope was that that would make it easier for participants and for us to have a familiar process so essentially we have a an application period in which you all submit an application and we review it both for eligibility and through competitive review process that leads us to the performance agreement and again we hope to really streamline all of the federal requirements within that performance agreement so the reporting and things like that are very clear at that point that occurs during those up to four years of construction and then finally we will close out a project at the end of that period so this is what we're proposing and again this is mirroring our community renewable energy Cloud program which is a complementary program that can fund the solar and certainly microblooded things like that can go through that program as well this next slide is just a you know throw something out there versus a broad categories for selection Criterion and this is pretty close to what we've set up within that Community Renewables program where we have a set of criteria that would describe project Readiness and Technical viability we need technically say on the projects in this where about half the the project weighed and then Community benefits can bring an additional amount of points into these applications in this example and then finally some percentage to help the funds get spread around the states of geographic diversity maybe some technological diversity although we've heard yesterday that that's not as critical in this in the other grant program we were trying to identify projects that weren't solo projects that tend to get all the funding in this one everyone went out and did polls or fuses that would be okay so maybe that's not an important we have a few slides now that look at the criteria that was set up in our other grant program if we want to look at those as an example or we could just log right into a blank page discussion about how we want to set up criteria in this program but the end goal is for us to identify you know features that could be described in an application that will",

        "text": " is a worst case scenario um for those two years for construction it would be about 34 gallons of water over that period of time the applicant states that it would purchase water from the christmas valley domestic water supply district water existing water rights from that district and the applicant provided permit in the application and then the department coordinated with water resource department to confirm those and other permit numbers um that that the water district could provide the water under um the applicant also says that it could possibly get water from um the the city of la pine um and then that was is limited to that representation so this corresponds back to public services and there is a letter from the water district saying that under um you know average circumstances that they would be able to provide the water however the applicant may need to have a water service provider the applicant is representing that it would also like uh it would also construct on up to two on-site wells um that would uh help provide water for the construction and operation of the um the let's uh a water resource department permit to appropriate the uh public waters or water right from it um there are several items in those permits and they establish the the date of the water right the use of the water the point of the diversion where does the water come from and the place of use under the permit to which the water right is a pertinent or where the place of use to that water could be used the proposed order provides a discussion of um kind of and a unpacking of water resources rules and statutes um that may that apply to permits um these water right permits um but again i'm gonna let jesse kind of unpack that um in his presentation but to address and confirm that indeed the applicant does not um need a water right the department recommends water rights condition one which has the items that are listed here um which also is and would like to reiterate that if later on the applicant did indeed need a water right they would have to go through an amendment process to then include that water right um under council's jurisdiction and governed by the site certificate and that my last slide so did we want to take a break and sarah and i touched basis or todd you take it yeah so i think where we're at now is it's a little after 11 i think we are in need of a break unless there's any other material changes that i'm not aware of that i heard during the conversation today i think it the it's limited to the the fire uh response question sarah's looked into it and if we do take a break um i believe we'll have some response to provide to counsel um and then you you can decide where you want to go with that so i would you know a short break right now and then then we can kind of get into this the options on this slide okay well this is marcy and the time is now 1108 i propose that we take a 15 minute break and return at 11 23 if that works for folks mercy yes this is cindy can i ask a quick question before we take a break and i forgot to ask it with respect to the um letter from heffernan so in the materials the letter um indicates i think a um cost of 19 million dollars versus the 28 million i think that it is now and i'm just wondering if there's there has been an update to the letter or how how that it might not make any difference 10 million dollars is significant talking about retirement yeah the retirement sorry and the letter the letter that heffernan sent specifies 19 million dollars in their given i think the new number of 28 is that of any concern or is there a a subsequent letter that uh amends it to 28 million or i don't believe so if i'm just kind of going back in time and drafting the dpo i know we asked for more information after the application was deemed complete and we asked for so there was kind of the cost estimate based on the complete and then we were drafting the dpo and we needed more information and so we asked for more information um with relate related to retirement and um which based on that is what reflected that evaluation the table in the proposed order and that 28.8 million but at that point in time once we got that number from that uh additional information i don't think we went back and asked them for an updated letter um that reference that captures that um so i don't believe we did that um with uh fair certainty so really uh we have them saying that they would uh feel comfortable right over the verbiages with the previous total but ultimately which really we kind of what we rest more on is that really the facility cannot be constructed and operated without that bond amount so if indeed they could not get that bond or letter of credit they cannot construct and operate the right and my concern is just the the reference to the letter i mean yeah if we're going to put 28 million dollars in there it just seems to me that the letter would indicate that so thank you i i think that i think that that's a really good thing for us to keep in mind you know even as we're moving moving quickly and moving forward drafting findings to issue a document that we need to make sure particularly as that total increases and i know we do this for other projects if it's if it's you know a significant amount we do ask them to update um their letter or basically wait until uh we've kind of confirmed an amount and then update the letters and i think that that's a really good thing to kind of put a pin in and make sure that we all right thank you i just thought i might have missed it thanks no you did it thank you okay well this is marcy again so the time is now 11 12 so let's adjust and still stick with 15 minutes and resume at 11 27. okay thank you council members and um wally and nancy i'm gonna stop sharing my screen um but will you you guys put this uh screen back up or this slide yeah that's no problem helen okay um and then and then when we come oh i'm gonna pass it over to you guys but when we come back um we may have you pass it back to me so we can be bought through some documents or if we need to and maybe sarah might want to do it because she might actually have revisions so anyhow i'm passing it over to you but i'll likely be passed back when breaks done no that didn't work so please restart the recording okay we're good thank you so we have returned from uh our break it is now 11 29 and i would like to call the meeting back from recess and continue on um at this point i just wanted to determine what the continued mean um todd if we're going to keep going with what we were discussing or if jesse is going to start presenting sarah has uh drafted some language associated with the plan so she can bring that up um share that and see if that is what you are interested in and then we can go from okay thank you okay so just um for a little intro as i understood it uh councilmember jenkins you were concerned there wasn't coverage if the application for annexation isn't accepted where if they went that route and left it at that then there's a gap so this is um this is the planned public services four refers to and kellen showed that on her screen as well and so um just so you understand the navigation so there's two places that that annexation and or membership and the rangeland fire protection association is the first is here so maybe i'll just pause and see if on the same page about the issue can you increase the size that a little bit to make sure everybody can see it yes thank you is that okay yeah that works for me i you know it's she'll either submit an application for annexation to the christmas valley rural fire protection district and demonstrate to the department that the christmas valley fire protection district annexed to include the facility site boundary so does that get at kent's comment yeah this is ken and i think there's another or that could be put in there um and it'd be either submit an application for annexation to the christmas valley rural fire protection district and demonstrate to the department that the cfpd annexed to include the facility site contract for services the christmas valley rural fire protection district or become a lifetime member of the rangeland fire protection association my only concern with the rangeland fire protection association they're going to having response for a rangeland fire right they're not interested in structural right that's very different from structural fires and i'm not sure how much that adds for yeah that that that caused me to hesitate too and my recollection is um that we would require uh like for a dwelling in the forest zone they either nx request to annex to the rural fire protection district and as hanley's been saying you know the fire protection doesn't have to annex those folks in we it would trigger then a requirement that they get a contract for services and i suppose if that didn't happen then we also had another provision that they had to provide on-site fire protection themselves with a water storage facility and hoses and that kind of thing i don't know if we go that far with this type of an application or not but what we can do is make they either ask or they contract that's what i think just to give everybody an idea about the environment it'd have to be a building fire because there's not not enough fuel on the ground to support a fire it's all lake bottom desert basically so right this this is only to address structural thank you thanks for comment perry okay uh chair great listen jordan are aren't they also supplying uh train or training for personnel as well as apparatuses or equipment on site thanks for the question jordan i will let sarah and kellen tackle that yeah i read that somewhere too i'm not sure if this addresses your your question um council member trip but this is the section of the plan that talks about we'll train yeah that's what i was reading through so it i mean it i don't know that this does not necessarily cover hanley's point i think it's a good one as fire is a very valid concern of all of ours but it does address that",

same veterans benefits as their male the women in the armed services integration act in 1948 allowed women to serve as part of the regular armed services but limited the proportion of women in the military to 2 percent of the enlisted forces and 10 percent of this limit was repealed in 1967 the end of the conscription and the transition to an all voluntary volunteer force in 1973 marked a dramatic increase in the opportunities available for women to serve in the military women played an important part and I've listed some of the numbers served in the casualties from specific wartimes periods on our slides they paid an important part in Staffing hospitals during the Civil War this led Blaze the trail for them to be recruited when shortages occurred during the Spanish War and the women were called to serve on the typhoid hospital ship Freedom and this led to the establishment of the armies and Navy's nurses Corps during World War One twenty one thousand four hundred and eighty Army nurses and 2 000 Navy nurses served the nurse cores were attached to the regular Army and Navy but in an auxiliary fashion again they did not have the same rights as Rank and veterans benefits as their male recruit shortages had led the director of the Navy to take advantage of some wording or lack of wording in the law Yeoman recruits were to be any citizens and foreseeing shortages in World War one he began to enlist women into the reserve status and when war was declared they were quickly activated during World War One twelve thousand Yeoman 305 Marines and 200 Army single core women they were quickly deactivated as soon as the war was over World War II saw additional needs in numbers with four thousand women serving and with the passing of the integration act women were allowed to continue to serve when peace was achieved however they were limited to the two percent of the combined Armed Forces a restriction that was not lifted until the post numbers that are listed up um are from 19 September 2001 to 2015. current demographics show that women make up about 17.3 percent of the Armed Forces and about 21.4 percent of the National Guard and this is the fastest growing demographic group in the armed forces there are some significant dates one is November 3rd 1989. that's the day I graduated from boot camp I think I got a pointer hair pointer well I'm the one two three third person on this side it lists the dates of the nurses Corps for the Army and Navy when the Navy opened in Lisbon to women prior to World War One in 1917 1942 the women's Army auxiliary 1942 the Navy also added women to the reserve forces interestingly enough in 1943 the Army changed them to the women women's Army Corps because as the auxiliary they weren't being paid as much as the other branches so women weren't enlisting in them so they changed it to to get the the same in 1973 is when they removed the the two percent restriction and open command um for female service members that's an important part for female officers because you can't be promoted without a command post uh women deployed in support of the Persian Gulf War in 1990 in 92 the defense authorization act repealed some of the combat exclusions in 94 women were allowed to serve on ships in 2011 women's can officers could serve on submarines and then in 2013 a great day for women veterans the Secretary of Defense announced the rescission of the 1994 direct combat definition basically opening all military occupations for women and we were allowed to serve along with men I appreciate the women who came before my time and service and respect the women who continue to serve this past weekend I had an opportunity to attend the Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs women's veteran conference and it's an honor to be counted among them good evening again thank you for having us here many many women who have served in the military do not identify as veterans while we were the most visible in uniform we are mostly invisible out of uniform in 2017 Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs in partnership with Portland State University created the I Am Not Invisible campaign it is a gorgeous photo exhibit featuring 22 Oregon women veterans in its aim was to increase awareness of issues specific to women veterans this campaign was um part of an exhibit that traveled across Oregon it traveled nationally to Washington DC and was hosted there at the United States Capitol it has also been replicated by numerous States veterans agencies including the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs as depicted in this wonderful image up here this I am not invisible campaign has really taken a life of its own and in just a matter of a few years and the exhibit was awarded here in Oregon the pillars of Excellence award from the National Association of State directors of Veterans Affairs in 2021 it is alive and well and continues to be an ongoing mobile physical exhibit that can be hosted by organizations and it's also virtually represented on our Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs website so I encourage everyone to go on to the Oregon Department of Veterans Affairs website and pull up our own I am non-invisible exhibit there's stories to that go with it and it's an impressive way to remember our women veterans thank you I also want to shine a light on some of the work we do over at Dave's um we would do we help all veterans of course reach a apply for their veteran their Federal veterans benefits including compensation pension and health care but recently we've been doing some extra Outreach for for women um and that served in the armed forces and this picture is a group of women veterans that have got together and we've filmed a four-part series called honor and service women in the military it'll air Thursday at 7 pm starting June 8th 2023 it'll air for consecutive Thursdays you might notice in that picture that there's one up there that looks a little different than the rest of us that's Paul Riggs he's a program specialist at Dave's he's been our executive producer our editor our filmographer our facilitator throughout the experience and we appreciate his kindness and his empathy throughout the process and with that I'd like um to let Carol and and Sherry read the Proclamation Board of Commissioners for Washington County 75th anniversary of the women's Armed Force armed services integration act June 12 2023. whereas women have played a role in the United States military conflicts since the American Revolution and whereas women are the fastest growing group of veterans and whereas there are more than 2 million women veterans with approximately 2 800 residing in Washington County and whereas women veterans are Trailblazers in an environment historically dominated by men and face unique challenges both in and after service and whereas",

        "text": " get that factual evidence into the record what this is intended to do is to be an opportunity to address the council through oral argument to talk about pieces of the exceptions that have been that address your issue um and to you know share those items with the council that you have particular concern about or want to highlight so with that in mind um again we're gonna stay within the scope of um the issue that uh um you've been granted limited party status for um and if there's references to factual evidence that it is to evidence that's already in the record of the contested uh or the the um proposed order so those are all the preliminaries i have um and so uh uh mr white uh whenever you're ready you can uh come on up or do we have recorded i guess that's the other thing i should say is we have recorded testimony from some folks who weren't able to make it here in person today and so in some instances we'll be listening to her recording and then seeing whether or not the applicant or the department have anything else to respond with hello council members i'm petitioner jonathan white presenting issue ss5 which is about whether the applicant idaho power has adequately evaluated construction-related blasting near a populated area of legrand i've been a homeowner in southeastern legrand for 12 years and my home is located about 500 feet from the b2h site boundary at hawthorne street my concerns have to do with damage to homes and local streets during construction i'm asking that you reverse the alj's decision on issue ss5 the issue is about whether idaho power is complied with the relevant structural which states that quote the applicant through appropriate site-specific study is adequately characterized the seismic hazard risk of the site in other words to obtain the council's approval for site certificate idaho power must demonstrate that they've conducted site-specific geotechnical surveys to characterize risks from slope instability and their response to my exception idaho power acknowledges the wording of the relevant standard but continues to claim that it's simply not practical to conduct quote a detailed site-specific geotechnical investigation for the entire site boundary in advance of obtaining full site access my response to their response is one no one is requesting that idaho power investigate the entire site boundary ss5 requests only that they investigate the stability of the slope above southeasterly grand an area identified as unconsolidated landslide debris and idaho powers application if idaho power has been able to comply because they obtain full site access that's their problem and not mine idaho's powers response is filled with lots of good intentions and excuses but there's very little it shows actual compliance with the relevant standard note the repeated use of the future tense in the following quotations idaho power will either avoid construction and areas of instability or will take robust measures to mitigate any impact idaho power will conduct site-specific geologic and geotechnical investigations such investigations will be performed by a professional engineer geologist where structures cannot be moved to realign idaho power will employ mitigation techniques end of quotes my reading of the structural standard is clear before the council can approve a site certificate to begin construction of the b2h idaho power must comply with the oregon administrative rules which are designed to protect oregonians from ill-considered projects such as and in addition i just wanted to ask the council not to delegate part two of the review make idaho power come back to fsac to prove they can meet the build part of the standard mr white okay so um the next part of the process will be to see whether or not the applicant has a response and followed by the department and again three minute time limit good evening council members i'm lisa rachner and i'm representing idaho power in this case the core of mr white's exception is really the same subject matter that we've been grappling with already which is the phased study process which allows the company to provide a primarily data but primarily desktop but not completely analysis in its application in recognition of the fact that it's simply impractical for the company to do a detailed site-specific geotechnical analysis of the entire route before it has a site certificate before it knows where the route is actually going to be and based on the conditions and the site do all of the final the final sighting and micro sighting it's at that point that it makes sense for the company to do this detailed geotechnical analysis and conditions that you've heard about are quite robust in terms of what will be required of the company i hear mr white is concerned because a lot of these are commitments that are going to happen in the future but they are commitments and they will be enforced by the council and they will be enforced by oto so once that those geotechnical studies have been done uh the studies will be done first of all in consultation with dogami and with um odo staff and all uh necessary mitigation microsiding changes will be done to ensure that uh the transmission line is safely cited and will not present seismic risks the other thing i wanted to point out is that this phase study process is consistent with the prod the second amended project order which asked the company to work with dogami to put together a an analysis that showed what we what we can do now what needs to be done in the future it's also consistent with your statutes which allows you to issue a site certificate with conditions that then allow odo to review the rest of the data as it comes in so there will be robust geotechnical all of that analysis and working with odo any changes that need to be made protect the public and the condition has been satisfied thank you if you have any response from department just briefly uh patrick crowe from the department of justice i think this really comes down to council's level of comfort with the structural standard so i'd recommend it to the extent that you haven't already take a hard look at them and make sure that you are comfortable with them as the alj has noted as has been noted in the in the briefs on this this type of format phased condit that doing studies after the site certificate uh is issued is common it's common for council to approve site certificates with those types of conditions uh so in this instance you just need to look at the structural standard conditions one and two make sure you're comfortable with them if there's anything that you think needs to be supplemented uh then please let the department know in the department that you would obviously need to let us know during the course of this hearing and the department could make those changes in your final order there is one note it didn't come up in oral testimony but it was in mr white's written brief on this exception where he took issue with the proposed contested case order statement that there was quote significant work that has been done and he took issue with the fact that there hasn't actually been significant field work that was done but it was just desktop study that has been done uh the department would recommend that that statement in the proposed contested case order be modified to clarify that the work that has been done to date has been reconnaissance level literature review and evaluation excuse me end evaluation just to remove any implication or suggestion that the work that idaho power has done to date has been significant field work it's been significant literature review and evaluation so you could clean that up in the proposed you can modify that portion of the proposed contested case okay so have uh reached the stage now on this contested case issue where um we're open for discussion um among the council members i'm here to act as a resource to answer any questions that i can about legal issues as tardy weather and miss esterson are available to be asked questions about locating information which they're going to have a better ability to do than i will you know if you want to see a a page number of something a piece of the proposed contested case order of an you know whatever that might be they can assist with that but the goal from is to you know take a a look at this particular issue that's been raised um see if there's a feeling that anything needs to be changed from the proposed contested case order and then you're going to be circling back to the the kind of the broader issue um you know with the goal of leaving the structural standard because we just have the one filed on one structural standard issue that we leave the structural standard with a good sense of where the council's at overall not just the uh particular um contested case issue but the standard as a whole um so with that i'll i'll turn it over um and i'm available to answer questions counselors are there any comments or changes recommended for the proposed contested case order so do we have the page number for those does somebody have them i want to start thumbing around through in terms of the contested case i would um accept the recommendation of counsel for department of energy to clarify that it was just significant desktop analysis so that would be the only recommendation in the contested case but i too would like to see the conditions so that we can ensure that those are responsive to the exception and to any other i agree and i think do any of the council with that making sure that's included to in the contested case order that i this is hanley i agree with ann but i would like to see the conditions you want to see that yeah just ask wally to download the proposed order so who will we at some point soon we'll be able to project on the screen the proposed uh i've also put oh wait so the page number of the proposed order is page 81 and 82. that has the language of structural standard condition 1. and structural standard condition 1 also references soil protection condition 4 which establishes a process where we have to get additional information prior to construction on any locations where blasting is identified as being and then if that's the case it routes you over to a blasting plan that's in soil protection condition four that condition has a formal local and federal reviewing agency process prior to construction to ensure that the blasting plan is zesterson the standard was on page 81 the condition was on what page the condition is on pages 82 and 83. that's the first condition so mr chair this is a question for jesse do we at what point do we allow then um rebuttal i guess it's rebuttal testimony i mean",

        "text": " ability to um prioritize funding to households that need it and not necessarily have them be competing against um like larger square foot households for the same dollars great well thanks for answering anyway um all right now on to the slide we're on um I still don't see any hands up we do have a couple of comments in here including from my former next door neighbor and dear friend um so Jeremy um just says if the purpose is to encourage energy improvements that would not otherwise happen and doesn't see much reason to spend money retroactively the exception would be if there's a delay between publishing the admin rules and the actual program launch date so I think for us it's less it's less publishing admin rules it's more our application and what we put in there that we would um and then what we put in we'd have to hear back from the Feds that they say okay to before we would feel good about that being the criteria that we think will be for the program so if we get the feedback from doe that like yes your program is accepted as drafted and then there's a big delay between that and the actual program launch dat AK us getting the money that's I think what Jeremy's saying might be interesting to think about and then Noel um wanted to share that retroactivity she doesn't think retroactivity is appropriate for Equity reasons but if they were to do it perhaps retroactive to January 1 2024 just to help contractors ramp up gradually instead of starting when um rebates are released and there's kind of a rush on them um I don't see any other comments and I don't see any other hands so I'm sure we'll get a couple of other comments on this slide later um but we can might go maybe go on and start thinking about the next Topic at hand so for this one um homes rebates will not cover 100% of project costs and while stacking with other programs is possible it's still likely that some of the project costs will need to be covered by the participant despite this do you have recommendations and considerations for reaching justice 40 and other disadvantaged communities with program while you're thinking about it one of the um areas where we're seeing overlap between um lowincome justice 40 or other disadvantaged community um and the homes program maybe lining up well would be in multif family housing um which also kind of poses its own set of um unique circumstances for trying to reach participants um and get participation in the program so just thinking about it um it could be framed specifically about um kind of uh single family homes in general or we could start talking in a little bit more about multif family homes with this uh David has his hand up I'll tell you when you're off mute David and I'm not sure if Stacy's here or Abby's here I know we're we're switching our moderators during our during or our host but we are green now great thanks Abby or Stacy David you're good to go yeah thanks so regarding specifically like um how to reach justice 40 and other disadvantaged communities I would say you know building into your delivery model you know community- based organizations who are focused on delivering services to those communities um you I you know modeled around what's gone on in Portland with you know Portland clean energy fund efforts you know we're starting to actually see a lot of success with that um where there are Community Based organizations that were never involved previously with Energy Efficiency programming are now involved uh in helping get those Services delivered to their community members who would otherwise you know not have been participants in these kind of programs in the past whether or not that means you know flexing some of the administrative dollars to go through those folks as official Outreach or navig positions or something else but including them in the delivery model thanks all right thanks David um we did get some feedback about concern about um 100% incentives can lead to waste and um Jay Ward hey Jay Wonder if PF or the climate Protection Program or the some of the other federal funds money that's coming in be stacked to cover j40 customer obligations the answer is probably yes on that stuff do you want to weigh in but I think that's definitely looking at stacking yeah although there's some limitations on like which federal programs can and can't stack together I know USD is trying to provide clear guidance on how much of what federal funding sources can go toward any given project um and so there's still some ambiguity about what what is and isn't eligible for stacking great but yeah we'll definitely be looking at stacking overall is a way to get there thanks Jay and yeah just what specific programs will be up for debate um Arlene wonders if the 80% Ami criteria is is that in effect here and covering 100% for those who qualify and 50% for higher incomes is that is that right um so that the reason why we're asking about this is because we we foresee it as challenging to meeting um some of the justice 40 requirements uh and targeting households and have limited resources and limited Capital to support energy projects um so how do we how do we navigate that space to try to reach um you know direct a minimum of 40% of the benefits of this program to those types households uh let's see um another thought on providing clear paths for multif family project may be the efficient path toward meeting justice 40 and then from Ashland Ashland likes to have good ideas generally and it says they're interested in combining homes with on Bill financing for a justice 40 track and um it'd be great if Odo could work with a CBO or the city to organize such a program so thanks for that idea Emily our super smart federal grants officer is waiting weighing in to say stacking rebates with non-federal funds like utility programs is generally allowable and encouraged as long as the total rebated value does not exceed the total cost of the project good there um and then we have a comment that an initial targeting analysis could drive this selection to identify uh dacks that will experience the best outcomes on their bills and provide system value relev to relative to existing constraints and that D communities are the most vulnerable to increased Bill impacts that can be the result of electrification so targeting connects the right customers to the right Solutions helping customers save on their bills while mitigating The increased energy burden from new technologies like home electrification and should be considered as a best practice for implementing these programs in Oregon so we make sure we look at that comment again later too and um and Jeremy again just saying there's currently huge utility incentives on many projects and measures I I don't know that that's necessar true for a lot of these um but it will almost certainly not be hard to exceed 100% um I I not sure I think nearly all incentive programs prevent you from being able to take an incentive over 100% for what it's worth and Derk Larsson thinks Outreach to renters both for the creation of the program and once programs are alive should be a priority um and um they may not be the decision makers but it is them who's going to affect the most so maybe look into build shift um effort in Portland there's so much that is happening in the city of Portland that we're very actively tracking and looking into for inspiration so thanks for that specific flag um I don't see any other hands up or any other comments right now so we can go ahead and move to the next slide and now a couple general questions um how can we just kind of talked about this but any other thoughts on how Odo can ensure rebates reach low-income and disadvantaged communities specific specifically that live in multif family housing so if you have any additional thoughts that specifically relate to multif family that'd be great and then what consideration should be made to encourage landlords to allow for energy efficient upgrades that benefit their tenants so kind of digging in a little bit more onto the multif family Andor rentals any thoughts on that David has his hand up David go ahead yeah and um thanks for recognizing me again sorry to take up too much time but I'm really glad you're raising your hand it's so helpful to have some conversation and not just me talking in the chat from the chat than I won't make it an echo chamber uh so I know some states have been considering just setting aside a certain amount of the he money for flowing through their um you know their state affordable housing finance office here that would be Oregon community housing community services you know they already have their oret program which is you know Energy Efficiency money for multi family um programs so just thinking if you just wondering if you might think about um you know pushing some of your money on here if you want to hit multifamily it could be aligned with that programming over there since they already do a process for folks to apply get identified and it's affordable um some of it's new construction some of it's retrofit but the here money isn't uh limited to just existing so um it could fit nicely alongside that money if you wanted to guarantee that it you were going to hit a certain percent of uh improving affordable multifam yeah and I will just note we've been talking with um housing community services about their programs and how we can um ensure that these are complimentary to each other so thank you for that additional flag on the specific program that they're working on yeah probably just good information too and then we'll get to Jay thanks for raising your hand Jay I'll get we'll get you off mute in a sec um but what I wanted to just quickly add to that is we actually have legislation that directs us to establish these programs and that legislation actually directs us to do it in coordination um with ohcs so definitely working closely with them all right Jay I'll let you know when you're off mute you are off mute I wanted toh touch on Jeremy's comments uh earlier and and I certainly am not immersed in all of our offerings but the only we an Indy trust operates uh in offers incentives for several of the investor own Utilities in the state and I can't think think of uh any incentives that I would consider to be huge with the possible exception of a heat pump pilot that we're running right now that is both Limited in time and budget um the rest of the ones that we offer at least in IOU territory are um basically cost effective and incremental um so I I would hope they would be leveraged into this program but I don't know that uh we're going to contribute much to the going over exceeding 100",

made a comment uh before and i think uh nrel mentioned they were gonna put put these platforms uh way well offshore but if you put these platforms near the shoreline you are now exposed to the possibility of tsunamis so such as the alaska earthquake tsunamis uh the the water which i think one of why one eye witness said that the water receded half a mile offshore before the tsunamis came in and in the that good friday uh earthquake uh tsunami uh also oregon coast is subjected to mag nine earthquakes subduction earthquakes uh tsunamis are gonna be about 50 feet high near the shoreline uh i did a rough calculation i think the american civil engineers had a rough uh uh uh estimated uh a way to estimate the impact force of a tsunami on a fixed platform uh like shown in the nrel technical report i got a rough uh pack force of nine million pounds on that uh platform that would shear it off uh i'm gonna share that thing off so i think it's a good idea to keep the platforms well offshore away from where the tsunami zone is that's my thanks harvey i see kathy's hand raised as well kathy would you like to go next hi kathy okay this is kind of a follow-on as to you know i haven't seen anything in the uh all of the up meetings prior to this dealing with the earthquake things but also it seems like that's got to be a major issue not just for the turbines but for the coastal infrastructure if you build a whole bunch of stuff at coos bay you know the nine magnitude cascadia how do you ensure that that's going to remain after the earthquake finished is that going to be is that going to be handled later today thanks kathy um i might check with jason to see if that specific topic is later or if that has come up in the literature in a different topic yeah i mean it does does seem like a major concern for yeah i mean i think this is the time and place to explore that um at least with the the turbines and platforms in that aspect we'll talk more about transmission um but yeah i mean we could talk about it then too um we did talk about a little bit of the let's review um and um yeah it's definitely something that we need to think about and consider but is there also the possibility of making coos bay the kind of maintenance that said report and so it seems like infrastructure would also be affected by yeah kathy i think you raise good points and i think that developers and industry would be considering that risk or would need to take some sort of um mitigating factors to their development but it's i like jason said i think it's been raised in the literature but perhaps without the like level of detail um that you would we would you know need it without a specific proposal i i'm not um sure jason if the literature has surfaced kind of um you know earthquake resilience and other in other situations but i know that the cascadia event itself um is you know likely to be pretty unprecedented so not sure how relatable that is i mean i i remember from the literature review that and even just circling back to um i think patrick did a good job of highlighting that there's only 100 megawatts in the world right now so um you know with a 10-year learning curve and seeing those projects and new products come online and trying to understand the risks exposure there especially with japan if japan and some of those other countries a lot on the other side of the pacific ocean that are kind of along this ring of fire that people heard about um i would expect they have kind of similar exposure especially um you know we remember probably it was ten years ago already but recently the anniversary of the fukushima earthquake so it's a concern for not only offshore wind but kind of any energy resource on the coastal that would be exposed to earthquakes so we might get some lessons learned and some more advancements um on the design and track record you know of performance in situations like that over the next 10 and i think that the reliability piece at least related to energy infrastructure will come up a little bit um in the next topic although perhaps without the specific um uh piece about earthquake kathy i appreciate you pissing it um yeah it does seem like resilience is is probably where a major place where it should go we are you know aware of some analysis that's been done in the um you know status quo uh without you know additional build out of energy infrastructure on the coast of um what might occur with a cascadia event and um significant um lack of energy being able to deliver be delivered to the region um so so we know that that's kind of the the part of the part of the equation as i think the resilience energy resilience aspect of that might be a good part of the discussion on the next topic though if you want to kind of bring that up again at that see a few things in the chat i thought might be helpful to just um raise and just see if there's any other feedback otherwise we'll have to move on to the next topic but there's been some you know for those of you on the phone good discussion about energy efficiency being critical to achieving our climate has actually provided comments to the northwest power council's regional of energy efficiency um suggesting there should be some more analysis to expand that um to include other benefits but even with more energy efficiency than what's currently anticipated the power sector is likely going to need uh continued significant build out of renewables to not only electrify end users that use fossil fuels like transportation but also to retiring and coal retiring coal and gas along the sort of trajectory of meeting clean energy and climate requirements there's also some questions around any reason for 1300 meters being an outer limit um there you know the the uh clarification is that it's 1300 meter water depths um there might be some more um information that others on the line from nrel could speak to on that um there was some discussion about transmission infrastructure that i think i'm gonna hold because we have a rather long discussion about transmission infrastructure coming up after the break good comments and response to the comments that kathy just made about energy supply being more resilient with natural disasters thanks for that and i think that will come up a little bit more in the next topic as well thanks patrick for um responding about the 13 meter water depth like the the current maximum cost effective depth for floating offshore wind um essentially it's not a technical limitation but would be pretty expensive and likely not in of interest to the and then mike has a question about floating officers or like yeah a good question about floating offshore wind at this scale requiring extension of transmission who will or who should build the addition to the transmission system that's like almost a perfect segue to our later topics so i'll hold that for for that time as well okay um jason i'm not seeing any other specific questions or raised hands i think you're good to move to the next make sure i'm unmuted i think so um so state and regional reliability and kind of the flavor of this topic is aimed at the power grid resilience so how does um the power grid respond and hold up to you know i guess a good example could be it could be an earthquake scenario um or wildfires would be another one um or or just kind of more run in the middle things like when the sun goes down and the solar kind of goes goes away what's there to back it up and so that kind of has a couple different prongs to it generation aspect and then a transmission and deliverability aspect to it so that's kind of the context for this we'll hear from travis deville uh he's a professional engineer who works on offshore wind for pnnl pacific national northwest national lab and he completed one of the first transmission studies looking at floating offshore when interconnecting to oregon's grid so he'll share a summary of that foundational study highlight the key findings relating to flooding offshore wind's generation profile and how flooding offshore wind and transmission expansion to accommodate the floating offshore one generation could affect great reliability and resilience and i think he'll also preview a new transmission study he's working on that's looking at different scenarios for southern oregon northern california thanks jason how's my audio and video coming across just a quick check coming in loud and clear okay great thanks for the introduction um and thanks for the opportunity uh to talk to this group uh today yeah my name is travis deville i am a energy systems research engineer and project manager at pnnl as we call it and i'm based in portland and i'm an oregonian i grew up as an argonian and so this is a particularly interesting topic to me i was glad to get the chance to work on it a couple years ago when we ran the first large-scale study of of offshore winter connections in oregon under bureau of ocean energy management funding at that time that study which i'll talk about here today but relatively briefly happy to take questions afterward when we have more time on it that study was more of a broad in terms of contributions to the grid some of which being resilience reliability related but but the study wasn't necessarily concentrated on that however as we move forward what i think what the collective um understanding how that how that is evolving um is very much along the lines of reliability um and resilience and uh this is an area of active research and and um certainly a big part of the study we have ongoing right now other studies that are happening down in california and and i also spend time working directly for the department of wind energy technology office and this subject of reliability um through coastal uh power generation and reversal of power flows uh sort of we're still understanding all the benefits that could accrue uh as well as as adverse impacts so it's um it's an exciting area to uh to be working in right now please next slide you very much so i guess it's like i could cut off a little bit sorry about that but um if we just start on the left half of the of the slide",

        "text": " 12 in rainfall area that produces an area that's more of the equivalent of a 15 or 18 inch so these weeds capture that moisture that's drifted off the side of the road and they take off and what I've experienced I I have to almost rename the road the kosha corridor because it is lined with kosher weeds that are four to six feet tall and spaced a foot apart so it's a challenge at best it's a nightmare normally to deal with this because the plant itself can produce upwards of a seeds so it's not it's it's going to proliferate it's going to drift into the neighboring crop land it's going to it's going to destroy the fences because the stocks are so big they don't go away for years they produce a fire hazard Because the skeleton is so big if a fire does go through there it'll exacerbate the length of the fire flame because there's so much material to burn if kosha gets started on some of these access roads it's going to make everything much harder and it's going to elevate the fire risk my experience with B2 and Idaho Power is that somehow the council passed on a weed control portion of that that proposed order when that got in front of Maro County's weed specialist it was a mess and there was because I dealt with him personally like what is the deal with this they're pressuring me to sign off on a weeds Bill weeds package that doesn't that's not even close to what we need here it put extreme amount of pressure on the the weeds supervisor for maroy County and they took it took time to develop something working with Ido power now I'm not saying the two developers that we're dealing with are the same all I'm saying is if a weed management program survived the council but by the time it got to the county level was not effective or acceptable at all because the local people know what happens I'm now I'm questioning is that going to happen here is a weeds Tool uh from this the project leaders is it really gonna is it really gonna gonna maintain control of the weeds or are we facing another battle as they want I'm assuming the county level to sign off on that strategy whatever is in the the proposed order so that is a huge concern of mine and I've I've faced the uh well I fac the disappointment of trying to bring relevant fire information to this Council and uh it wasn't accepted I'm hoping that somehow the data that I was that was rejected has been um reanalyzed it was good to hear the odod Personnel just ahead of us talk about the speed and the likelihood that the flammability of this area um just for your knowledge and that aspect Marl County uh produced a uh online document where they summarized the f s that have occurred in Maro County for the six years between 2013 2018 so I did the math on average each of those years in the middle part of the county which is where this sighting council is at 4.2 Acres 4.2 square miles of a of Acres burned per year to the tune of 160 some Thousand Acres over the course of six years so this is uh We've we've already we've already fought we fought fire uh near this this thing last fall um from a distribution line the bird got tangled up in and there was over six Vehicles fighting that fire and it took six hours and that was on a relatively calm evening so fire can get EX get out of control in this area it's a mountainous Rolling Hills it's difficult to fight that is a big deal and this environment needs special con consideration when it comes to fire control fire suppression so much of this area has no currently none whatsoever and so all we have to look forward to honestly is more fires because it's going to have more infrastructure more susceptibility to human CA and or lightning CA at current I think the the uh fire um program that they put out said in this mid part of the county 70% of the fires are from lightning so if we have more things sticking up in the sky I'm kind of under the assumption that we're going to have more lightning strikes um in and those can start fires so uh those are my big concerns that whatever is in the draft proposed order having to do with weed control and or fire suppression or or all of that combined that's given a really deep review and uh if you need to coordinate with Marl County or frankly some of the other counties uh what they're doing in in addition to maybe what you're recommending that those be brought into this uh particular review uh this is a very difficult area to fight fires in and it's it's so remote it's hard to get to some of these areas and then with the with the various uh components that are going to make it uh probably people are going to be less uh able to fight fire because of they're they're not sure how close they should be to certain structures or whatever but uh we uh my father was hopeful to have wind towers all the Farms I understand that all the farms in this area are hoping that wind will be a financial stability for them and we have wanted that too but it's never worked for us um so I'm not opposed to the project in general I'm just saying it has to be done correctly it has to be done with respect and I would really appreciate that the GLE andb area would survive that if we can tuck when to bundle them differently um I would really appreciate that but I do hope that the council is hearing my tone is that um there are some real specific considerations that need to be managed properly moving forward um and uh I I I appreciate hearing letting me hear hear my story tonight thank you thank excuse me thank you for being here Mr Myers and before you um get get up anybody have a if not I do and I it's I think it's appropriate for me to ask a question as the um yeah council member um so you said you submitted um some fire information was that a part of this process or who can you just Prov oh on B2 and it was rejected um so if you have fire information and our Wildfire standard is relatively new um so I encourage you to submit anything you you have that was a that was an unfortunate issue in that um you were the one that supported me in that at that moment okay so I appreciated that uh I drove to Lexington gave my three minute testimony and you wanted more information as the record showed that I've seen prior and uh I would have loved to seen that gone a different direction but uh well facts do matter in these hearings and so absolutely yeah it's a new standard relatively new standard so um we're all learning through it so thank you so much for being here Devin no this not comments or questions Madam chair thank you oh we have one more yeah thank you James cutsforth James cutsforth yes I have a a farm in Wheat Ridge 2 has Towers on it so I can address some of the concerns that you've heard previously um number one fire protection I mean you're going to build 56 miles of allpurpose all- weather roads into an area that has no access so you're going to really help fire fighting because you're going to provide the access the tower the the the service roads will be access roads where there are none and that country is long ways between draws and a lot of country so it'll make a big difference what it fighting for fire uh as far as we control um we've been working with nexxa hand inand rewriting and tetr their their Consultants uh addressing and trying to build well we're not trying to we're building better weed control plans move to move forward and and U they've been very supportive and and tetr has been very supportive and we've got a lot of input from local people we've had the county weed Master involved we've had the nrcs involved uh everybody in the local um has had input so um and and and their applicator and and it's a learning curve because it's not something that they've really addressed before it doesn't appear I mean there uh they have but it at a 30,000 foot level not on the ground and so they're getting experience uh I you know I wholeheartedly I'm not worried about them moving forward for on weed control I think they've got a handle on it and um they're they're they're good in the community they're they're good so that's basically thank you um councelor Grail hi hi thank you coming you bet sorry no sorry um you said nrcs the natural resource conservation service thank you my brain and AC acronyms right now overloading thank you Department of Agriculture yeah thank you any other questions or comments from council thank you Mr cworth for being here this evening another yeah another recommendation I would recommend that they they take an opportunity to to meet with the local fire districts and I think it's Hepner has most that area to to learn you know learn where they can protect and where can't and they meaning next era next era yeah once they once they get the project completed it'd be it would be probably be good use the time to plan that out okay thank you very much okay and now um anybody on webx on the webinar if you're on the webinar use the raise your hand feature there's no one with their hand raised at this time but I will go ahead and remind members of the public how to participate so if you're on the webinar at the bottom of the main window is a set

ready we've got you now okay good evening good evening my name is Fuji krier f uji k r eii d r 60366 Marvin Road LR Oregon uh I'd like to speak tonight as a community-minded and engaged Oregonian most

        "text": " these kinds of questions and envision what um scenarios would provide the most fruitful information to address uh kind of questions and concerns that that folks have around the state so I just wanted to point that out before we move on to the next question with an important caveat that we can't model everything we got we have constraints about how much budget we have and how much the mo modeling we can do so a scenario might have multiple things in it so we'll combine things into a scenario but because we're limited to how how many scenarios we can possibly run because it takes what how many days to run a scenario when you once you got all push the button to go Jeremy couple of days yeah so it's not a simple chug and play thing it's a a very sophisticated model that has a lot of iterations in it okay thank you all so let's let's promote Jake we'll do um we'll grab another verbal question and then I'm G to try to run through a bunch of chat questions in the next 15 minutes or so Jake you're on mute Jake if you're talking to us there you are can you hear me thank you got you um yeah I have a couple follow-up questions that maybe tie together some of the earlier answers um W with that and I guess in the backdrop of this is the statute says that you know this exercise is to implement the state's uh energy policies and I I I guess there's a question about how that's officially being defined relative to what's in statutes which are a lot more electric power focused versus Transportation which is also dependent on a lot of electric power um in the Genesis of this bill really was born of um you know particularly Ken Helm um but other legislators you know a history of concerns that the investment the IOU utilities are effectively excluding primary options from the model for the grid Power Solutions and in particular like rooftop um and wamit Valley solar and a number of things like that so I think we view this exercise as primarily directed at trying to remedy a lot of those deficiencies and ensure those things actually get modeled and so I guess part of my question is is one how are we defining what are the policies of the state that are going to be implemented um but then you you know earlier I heard you talking about public data sets and um and so forth and so we've seen a lot of issues where you know folks like um you know wood McKenzie and other you know people with forward price curves and so forth are essentially presuming the outputs of the IOU IRP model which are largely you know a lot closer to rubber stamped and and those are the exact source of the problems that we have in that we're trying to solve in terms of getting those other things in the models there's you know assuming transmission lines that don't exist assum you know excluding things like large scale rooftop solar wamit Valley solar and all kinds of Alternatives that are you know I guess both critically critical to success on electric power decarbonization but also critical to address in the deficiencies we have in the model so I guess I'm a little concerned about how you're going to approach those those issues um and especially because we've seen a lot of those models not you know forward price models Etc essentially assuming you know presuming the success of irps Andor build outs that are actually pretty impossible to achieve relative to actual grid constraint timelines like you know which you know so thus if you're also going to assume California succeeding at their RPS goals when they might be tens of thousands of megawatts behind um you know are those things then also again flowing through the model so a bunch of questions around how you're going to approach those issues but kind of a core focus of this exercise for Oregon is is fixing some of those problems so that we have an alternative you know vision of of what the state needs to do to succeed and can do to succeed so I don't know if that's a Odo Jeremy and a preview of the conversations yall are going to have in the room um Edith do you want to start yeah well I was gonna I was goingon to see if Jeremy wants to start by describing just how the model addresses some of the specific issues that Jake mentioned and then um and then I can come back and talk speak a little bit to the the process yeah so I I think the the main challenge that you're highlighting there is that there are a lot of ambitious goals out there not not just in Oregon but other places and it's um there there are potentially a lot of barriers to to realizing those goals both uh overall and in the time frame that they've been proposed and so there are options for us in in through this working group process to be looking at scenarios where those things don't play out the way that we expect them to so um citing and permitting constraints being one of the the huge uh barriers to to getting things built in a Time fashion um particular when you look across the West at the number of gws that need to be located to meet energy targets um and so what what if we we can't build resources at the rate that that we expect that we or not expect but have been um uh setting ourselves up to do in policy so that's one option to do it in a scenario constrained way like that um an example to your point that we have seen in our recent work is that we used to have offshore wind being selected in Oregon uh in a pretty reasonable quantity um prior to California setting a target of 25 gaws if we include that Target it kind of eats that market for offshore wind and we don't see as much being built in Oregon um but realizing that 25 gaw is is uncertain and so um there's an example where the is an impact on on Oregon um and it's it's determined by what policy is being set in other places thank you so oh yeah yeah I just I just wanted to add a a couple of points one is that um in the working group meetings we'll give an overview of the data sources that we're using for kind of the key um the key areas that the that that we're modeling um and I think that that will help answer some of Jake's questions about kind of where we're getting our information and what's going into the model and I also want to say that we are it's really important for us to be careful not to contradict anything that the Pu has already weighed in on uh I just think that's really important to make clear we're not looking to relitigate anything that's been decided um we are in touch with the p and with utilities to understand what's in their plans and to take them into account in the strategy um and we also all know that the farther out into the future we get um the more questions there are and the more uncertainties there are if if I if I might like there's a what what I my concern there is is if the base case is starting with Hyper optimistic models that are functionally known to be impossible um we're not going to get the right starting points and is a basic example of of what we're dealing with in Oregon as a primary number one Oregon Electric Power issue is you know the power lines from east to west over the mountains to the loads are heavily constrained if not already full any new power lines will take 10 or 15 years to build we have utility models showing that there will be transmission capacity five years from now and at 2030 that will not exist so I don't think that our starting place for this exercise and literally the reasons for this build being driven or related to this in the first place should presume those same things so how do we come out of the gate in a way that constructs the base case scenario so not essentially presuming The Impossible but rather starting with the realistic functional constraints because the model can't choose rooftop solar in Portland if it's assuming that multi-billion dollar transmission lines will exist that won't and so forth and and that is functionally you know the heart of of this exercise for Oregon achieving those policies in similar L you know the state has formally adopted legislative policies preferring you know direct benefits in Oregon Etc so you know the question of how are we going to account for that relative to um the you know importing from other places and so forth or again also assuming decarbonization levels have succeeded in those places that are also functionally impossible relative to interconnection and transmission timelines and that's I guess the heart of what I want to get to is actually starting with a realistic base case um given that part of the point of this exercise is to you know actually achieve our goals and and uh as well as to implement the formally adopted policies of the state which are very explicit um on on some of these things yeah thanks Jake yeah I mean I'll be quick because I realize there are a lot of other questions but the these are really good points they're very appropriate points to bring up in the um transmission distribution working group I'll just add that we are modeling an east and west side to Oregon to take into account the um the kind of the constraints over the Cascades and then what we will say about that I think this is something that we'll work through in the group um they're great points thanks yeah maybe have Jeremy describe how transmission gets handled in the model World briefly sure so we are we are breaking up the West into zones and for the most part those are state level zones uh in Oregon we will have an East and West Zone and in California we'll have a north and south Zone and then the flows between those zones it's it's pipe flow constraints so there are no um kirkov flaws or anything that are driving the representation um but for long-term planning it's giving us a representation of of what might be possible to move from one place to another and we'll have options to expand those transmission connections um so how much can we uh get from reconductoring from collocation of lines from building um new green field lines and then constraints on when that's possible so when is it possible to rec conductor line when is it possible to build a new line um and those will be constrained in the model um one thing to Jak's point is that we we are um working with data holders to try and build a representation of what that East West limitation is um and I think it's it's going to be hard to characterize the opportunities to expand it",

Could you talk about transportation that will be provided by the district and with respect to them, they said that they are one of those who are in the area, how they were selected, they are respectful At a cultural level, it responds to the needs of the parents And those children Well, the second question Well, actually the two, the one about the student comes from or wherever they come from This is a model that in which they choose for medical necessity may also There are students coming from other districts, each District has the responsibility of bringing transportation to the site. So that is going to be part of it. The second part of your question, there was a comprehensive group that began to meet in February in the center of County for mental health and we sat down and started talking about the need and who would be the most appropriate provider and also the second part of this is that there has to be a family component a parent as part of the treatment so we have to supervise this very closely. nearby we apologize again but the sound is interrupted and we have to see how they also respond to families that speak different languages \u200b\u200bthat have different cultures that is going to be part of that governance structure and our continuous conversation. That's why I think it's very important that the district have a community-based governance structure principal Carson garringham any questions or comments I have a couple of questions this sounds very encouraging to me Thank you very much for all this work how do you refer to children being referred to trillions if the district does not have the decision about their placement What is this like in real life, let's say we have already successfully gone through this as a District but sometimes it happens that the father or mother who already potentially has a Mental Health therapist that they have access to but also this We have done it with parents who know what the need is that they may already consult a private provider and We call that parent we help them we cannot place let's say But we can help them navigate the system we already did it with a children's farm there are also some in the Portland area that we have helped That is the important part trained Case managers counselors school directors etc. they really follow everything closely and we are talking about a small group of children with a very complex need my Second question is what do we do now? It doesn't seem like we are sending kids outside to get this type of care and treatment. There is no partial fatigue for daily treatment in the county. If we look at the map, it's like a treatment desert. That's part discouraging. really Thank you very much This is a critical need and I think it is fabulous that this is being organized my last question is do you know how many educators are going to be needed in the building establishes one educator for health we are going to need three and we are not immediately looking for education educators special because not the students have disabilities but the Licensed education staff we need three and then some staff and administrative support if we think the grant is going to cover all that but maybe we keep part-time special education as part of the fund general Thank you very much director Yes thank you very much I remember in the initial days when we met in the enpi office really This is something very thank you for taking it so far This is going to be a great help I have two questions from a structural point of view this is a much needed help for us in developing this memorandum of understanding The question is are we going to be against Establishing a contract with providing your services this treatment component needs a licensed facility with inspection Because we start with the lease we start the renewal and then the status maybe a barrier returns And then we return we become financially responsible We already have the Oregon utility on site The health authority They have worked with or Been talking to trillium with our entire production team and they know What the requirements are And they know that they have to do the authority is already in place know how to handle this the second question is trillium is going to be billing private insurance and American that is going to be financially sustainable for that day treatment to be part of your treatment program or what is the budgetary impact that this is going to have on the budget of to complement or carry out the we can continue throughout the term without incurring that 50% financial responsibility well this is how the control contract operates they are fully responsible for the components of the Mental Health is a private company and they would not be asking to open another treatment site here and we apologize for the interpretation booth but the sound was cut off they are not going to accept financial responsibility from them the most important difficulty has to do with the renovation with construction with finding the place and we're looking at let's say what the leasing agreements are and especially in the beginning we want to make sure that the place is up to par with what we want for the kids there's going to be some conversations in Liz's place we can establish some other other structure they are a private company And you know how all this works we are going to have then a direct memorandum of understanding yes it is going to be a comprehensive memorandum of and the district is going to initiate the with this organization and we will to take care of the long-term subsidy, then the responsibility in case something happens to the children or there is a complication, the treatment will fall on the School District or on the school board of directors of the district, even if the children come from other districts, that is how it is That is a very good question because this treatment program is in the Jarvis district and we apologize again but what we are hearing is cut off. They have some nerves but at the same time they know that Kaiser has the ability to carry this forward it would be the same if someone opened a youth treatment center that is not located at Kaiser If that opened independently of us have a memorandum of understanding the children located there would fall under Kaiser education that is clearly stated or is an addendum to the memorandum that protects The private donors and us, the private donors, have already reviewed the memorandum of understanding, as well as our legal advisor and they believe that they have the provision they need. Within this memorandum of understanding, various lawyers have reviewed it. Thank you, note that it is 8:53 and Our The goal is to finish at nine because we have the interpreters until nine so I think I'm fine with using a couple more minutes for questions but I think we're going to have to leave out the board reports for another time because we don't have time Now, Director Hudson, could you clarify what determines the amount of time that the children dedicate. These activities are full days. Partial days. Well, in the day treatment place, they will dedicate",

        "text": " slide before this one? Yes. So for consumption, are we. These things are things that are being considered in the workshops, are we. Well, is consumption also, are we prescribing diet changes that people should consider making or should start making? And I'm, I'm, I'm not against this, but I'm just reluctant to say that without, like, USDA present. No, the city will not be. Yeah, we're not. Yeah. So there won't be any prescriptive diet recommendations from the city. The idea is to help people understand the carbon footprint of their various food choices. So what we know from all the research that's been done and all of the calculations that have been done is that there are certain foods that have a very high carbon footprint, especially if we are importing them into the community. So, for instance, production of beef is extremely energy and water intensive. It requires a lot of inputs. And so that's one of the things that we want to show to people. Now, that doesn't mean that if you're buying your beef locally grown here in Washington county from, you know, a grass fed pasture, that's gonna have a very different footprint. So we're talking about kind of that grocery store beef that is coming from the midwest. It's got a different impact. Or if you're eating meats or dairy that are imported from outside of the US, it has a. It has a big footprint. So the idea is to help our community members understand that and do things like promote our farmers market and, you know, various ways that you can actually eat these foods grown locally that have a lower footprint. So there will be no prescriptive diets. I wish I had that kind of power, but I don't think I do. I want to be mindful of the fact that some people may be able to make those choices because their income supports that, but some people won't have. And so I want to be mindful of affordability, what that really means for food consumption, and then also have some consideration about cultural differences with regards to food. And so I think it would be important to understand that while identifying what foods might be more less healthy, let's say, I think it's important to give some consideration to culture differences. For sure. We had some wonderful input in our workshop from folks from Adelante Mujeres, who talked about the cultural importance of eating meat in their diet, because they grew up in countries where they didn't have access to meat. And now that is, it's very important for them to have that as part of their diet. And so the idea isn't to shame or, like, point fingers at anyone for doing the wrong thing or to take away what people need to be healthy. The ideas just give people that information. And also, we are thinking about ways the city can lead by example. So, for instance, for city events, we can host that we. That we host that include food. We can focus primarily on plant based options. That tends to be a healthier option for a lot of people, and it helps people understand different ways of eating. And that's sort of lower on the food chain and lower on the carbon scale. Does that help? Yeah. And I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but what I see is not a lot of folks in my ward who were shopping at farmers market. I do see a lot of people shopping at Winco and buying all kinds of different, you know, different sorts of food. Plant based is a challenge because it's, it's something that's very specific and I can't say that it is affordable for people. So again, I just want to caution and be mindful of cultural differences with regards to food consumption and where people get their food. Sure. And I'm happy to continue this conversation with you. I did a year of Americorps and we found that eating vegan was the only way we could stretch our dollars. So there can be different approaches to learning about how to cook with scratch materials. But yeah, this should be probably an offline conversation. Happy to continue that with you. Should I go ahead and move us forward? Okay. Okay. All right. So I just have a couple more slides here. So in addition to our work to develop a climate plan, the city has efforts underway already to tackle climate change and promote environmental stewardship within our community. So I've listed just a few examples of those projects. So we do maintain more than 35 public ev charging stations and we're adding more. We worked with the Energy Trust of Oregon and Solar Oregon on a solarized Hillsboro and Cornelius campaign to help homeowners install solar arrays and battery storage. We collaborate with cities, counties and other partners in the region to share climate action strategies. We have applied for us Department of Energy funds to add more public EV charging stations and complete H Vac upgrades at the Jackson Bottom Nature center, and we are currently working on an EPA community change grant proposal for community climate resiliency projects. The environmental Stewardship committee continues to track and adjust the city's environmental stewardship indicators and will be producing an annual report later this summer. And the ongoing Hillsboro 2035 plan update will also likely draw ideas for climate related projects. So as a reminder, I'm going to give it a plug here. Anyone can enter their ideas for the 2035 plan on the city's engage Hillsboro page throughout this summer. So please check that out if you haven't done so yet. And finally, notes here. As I wrap up, I wanted to share that Hillsboro is also leading efforts to address climate change within our city organization itself. So here's a sampling of that internally facing work. So we have a sustainability revolving fund which helps support department climate, sustainability and social equity focused projects. We've developed a new employee training about sustainability topics. Our first one is about where and how employees can charge their electric vehicles when they drive them to work. We've launched two new environmental committees, one focused on policy development and one focused on technical project implementation. The goal there is to ensure we're doing cross department coordination on our environmental work. The city has a new policy to reduce waste generated via the stuff we all get, or swag use as giveaways and event materials. And the fire department is developing a community wildfire protection plan in collaboration with the consulting firm and other city departments. And finally, the public works department is recruiting an urban forester that'll be a great addition to the city's environmental and natural resources management and climate resiliency work. That job posting is open now through July 14. Another plug. So I just want to thank you for your time today and see if you have any further questions. So, Robin, going back to the previous slide, somewhere in here, do we have, are we moving away from gas powered blowers and trimmers and things like that, say, for instance, with our parks and rec maintenance or. So if there's specific actions that we're doing within some of our departments, that'd be great to hear. Yeah, we don't have a specific policy on that, but we do track it. So annually, all of our departments are required to report to us on the types of equipment they have and how it's powered. So we're tracking it. It's moving slowly in a direction towards less liquid petroleum fueled products. Part of the problem with that is even if they add the electric, they tend to keep the gas as backup. And so it's still part of our inventory. So we don't have a great way to say what we're using on a day to day basis. But I know that our equipment managers are very, very focused on that, and they're always testing new equipment. They're working with equipment manufacturers to test out things to see what will work in our climate. The biggest problem with some of that equipment is it works great in California where it doesn't rain, but it doesn't work as well here. Electric equipment in the rain, it's not always a good mix, and it sometimes just doesn't have the battery power to operate as well as gas. So we're moving there as quickly as we can. But it's not going to be like an overnight transition, I don't think, for us. Well, you know, I think, personally speaking, I'm happy to trade off a little bit of the works as well in order to save, you know, our environment. And so, you know, for whatever that's worth. And I would love to see, you know, I guess I'll direct this more to Robbie, but I would love to see kind of a timeline for phase out so that, yes, we keep, you know, a couple of gas powers, you know, backups, but I'd love to see, you know, kind of a phase out timeline. And maybe that's done over x number of years, but it'd be good to know how many years that might be. Thanks. I want to say thanks for the briefing, Robin, and I'm very excited about many of the things you talked about, specifically the urban forester. I'm super stoked. I knew they were coming, but to know that it's posted is really exciting. I didn't know about the new swag policy, so I'm really glad to hear that that makes sense. Thank you. Yeah, I can't take credit for that, but I will pass it on to the folks who really did the hard work to design it in our communications team. Excellent. Yeah. And Robin, this is counselor Sinclair. I always. I want to thank you again also. I always enjoy your presentations and the work you do. Can you share just a little bit about what we can expect with the climate protection plan? Potentially? So the climate protection plan was implemented, and it was rolled back on an administrative role technicality. So the goal with that is. Let me flip back here, not go too far. The goal with that is to drive down that light blue bar in on this,",

generated so that you can see those comments the official comments you know for the ordinance will come through public testimony and when we have our community Forum that will be recorded and we'll have notes and comments about what people say there we'll have an online open house two online open house houses where people can comment and then we'll likely have a survey at some point too where people can't well that will be recorded and we'll have information that way as well but the community events it is a little bit trickier it's more just sharing information about the project and point directing people to the project website so they can continue to stay informed yeah if I could just add at the end of the project I think we we will put together a summary of all the community engagement and maybe themes that we heard or maybe things that we change as a result of what we heard so it'll be we'll be gathering all of it and since there are so many different ways that we'll be gathering the information um we'll have to think about how we put that together but we will want to be able to share that with the Planning Commission and with the board um so they could see the kind of Outreach that's been done the kind of comments that we've had how that influenced the process as we went through it um and and that sort of thing yeah that sounds good um commissioner moribidu thanks commissioner Lockwood um I had a just some follow-up questions about the equity component of this um on the uh technical advisory committee is there any representation of any indigenous groups or other opportunities representation of um people of color or a different Society socioeconomic when we formed our technical advisory committee we looked to kind of the agencies the local agency represent representation because it is of a technical nature and they selected who who through that agency who should be serving on the committee we also met with our office of equity I never get the oeic committee and met with the what's her uh Amanda I know it's a Amanda and kind of talk that through with her a little bit so you know well how can we get to reach the community-based organizations or did she was she aware of any members that may want to serve on a technical advisory committee and and she um really thought that this that from her work that they were very very busy on other kind of higher priority issues and due to the technical nature of this that the best approach would be to really reach out to them and through the newsletter process and keep them informed that way and we would meet with any of the agencies and go over the project and get their feedback in that way versus uh having a technical advisory committee member was the feedback that we that we had through the oeic at this point okay thank you for that information I just do want to add that I think that even though everyone is really busy it's important to um present opportunities and somebody might step up and if those opportunities aren't presented then we are missing valuable perspectives agreed agreed thank you are there comments and questions can you briefly put back up the uh the slide that shows the technical advisory members so we can just browse that one more second um what number is that that is slide 19. thank you any more commissioners well thank you very much Ms Miller I think we're ready for our next session which is um 2023 Urban growth boundary expansions thank you and Todd Berkowitz will be giving this presentation all right uh could everybody see the slides yes yes all right uh so good evening chair Lockwood PC members I'm Todd borkowitz associate planner and Community planning uh with Department of land use and transportation in this presentation I'll be giving a brief overview of the urban growth Andre or ugb and the egb expansion process uh so we'll be highlighting the 2023 expansions in Washington County describing the County's ordinance process for accepting the expansions into the urban area and then identifying next steps uh before getting too far into this I just wanted to stress that uh despite all that I will be sharing with you this evening the County's role in ugp expansion is very limited uh in Oregon ugb expansion is primarily a city-driven process and done for well-defined state and Metro rurals the county primarily serves to help ensure that a city's vision for urbanization can be achieved so on that let's move on to the next so egb is a line it really is just a line drawn on planning maps to designate which areas or Urban and which ones are rural uh area inside the egb can be used for Urban Development Area outside most people or can be preserved for uh uh in its natural state or used for expansion is only allowed under certain circumstances as defined by the state and by Metro and in Oregon UTV supports Statewide planning goals to protecting farms and forests from urban sprawl and promoting the efficient use of land public facilities and services inside the ugb next slide please all ugb expansion whether for the Metro UTV or for a city ugb and I'll Define those more here a bit uh it's Guided by Statewide plating level 14 which aims to provide an orderly and efficient transition from from rural to Urban use to accommodate Urban population and urban employment needs the Portland metro area shares one Urban growth boundary which is managed by cities within Metro can propose UTV expansion to Metro and areas outside but adjacent to the Metro ugb for expansions can occur called Urban Reserve areas or so cities outside of Metro uh including cities like Banks Gaston and North Plains of Washington County have their own ugb and these cities can consider adjacent land for you to be expansion as long it is is it is not designated as World Reserve next slide please so here are the two ugb expansions in Washington County in 2023 uh one Metro ugb expansion and one non-metro UTP expansion so both these types of expansions are required by the state to go through a similar but a separate a somewhat different process that I'll be describing further so the lower one shown here tigard's Metro UTV expansion encompasses about well just over 500 Acres it was approved by Metro Council earlier this year January and then the Oregon Department of land conservation development or dlcd approved this may so tiger uh is inside of Metro and is governed by the metro egb expansion uh the expansion on the uh near the top of this graphic is North Plains and North Plains is outside of Metro and is governed by the state process primarily uh however because there are adopted Metro reserves surrounding it the North plain ggb expansion is subject to some Metro regulations uh the North Plains ugb expansion of approximately 855 buildable Acres was approved by North Plain City Council uh yesterday uh and for State rules the uh the same ugb alignment must be approved by Washington County prior to be prior to it being considered by the department of land conservation and nope next slide please may I ask a could you explain a little bit more about the map and did the dark brown I'm not sure where the expansion areas for North Plains the um the dark brown areas represent the proposed ugb expansion the lighter brown areas represent undesignated undesignated area it's neither rural Reserve nor Urban Reserve uh there is a more detailed map in a little bit okay maybe you'll be able to see better and let me just add up the green on this map indicates rural Reserve those are areas that uh cannot be expanded into in um in the near term and the blue areas none of which are around North Plains uh represents the urban Reserve areas that apply to the Metro Urban growth boundary all right um next slide please there we go so tiger it's Metro ugb expansion is primarily to accommodate future housing demand in the city uh North Plains expansion is to accommodate future residential demand including parks and infrastructure as well as future Industrial and Commercial demand you can see kind of some of the breakdown here in total the two ugb expansions could result in over approximately 5 000 homes next slide please so I'm going to talk a little bit about the Tigard Metro ugb expansion Metro was not statutory statutorily required to comprehensively review the Metro ugb through its required six-year cycle until 2024 however is allowed under Metro code tiger submitted a mid-cycle Amendment proposal for Two Urban Reserve areas Roy Rogers East and West um shown here in green that compromise River Terrace 2.0 after the city completed concept planning for this area so Metro approved the proposal through a land exchange a process allowed under state law that has been used successfully elsewhere in Oregon but never by Metro the action required moving a comparable amount of buildable land elsewhere in the Metro planning area that was actually in Clackamas County Metro opted to remove these two areas in Clackamas County from the Metro ugb that have not demonstrated Readiness for next slide please and here's a timeline for the tigards Metro ugp land Exchange in 21 Tigard requested the mid-cycle ugb expansion uh this February Metro opted instead to do the egb land exchange instead of the expansion and then soon after dlcd deemed the egb land exchange complete uh Clackamas County did object and uh continues to object to Metro's decision but dlcd in May determined that the objection wasn't valid dlcd granted final approval in May and appeals are now exhausted enabling Washington County to move forward on transferring River terrorist 2.0 to the urban area next slide please so we're moving out of the North Plains ugb expansion as I indicated earlier expansion of a non-metro ugb like North Plains is required by the state to go through a similar but different process so like kinds of plans required by cities seeking to expand the Metro ugb North Plains had to identify a need for additional land to meet its estimated growth in the next 20 years as required North Plains developed and compared alternative locations for each of the expansion to identify a preferred alternative that is accommodating and cost efficient while resulting in the fuse conflicts with neighboring land uses and the least economic and environmental impacts so shown here is uh the North Plains eugb adopted alignment again city council had just adopted this last night um the blue area is current airplanes uh or the current North Plains Urban growth",

generations so this is a big deal for these landowners who were absolutely involved in the design and sighting of this facility so here the landowners they identified the best location based on their use and their knowledge of the land and as matt indicated the site that was that was is in fact considered the worst you know um least productive agricultural property in their land holdings that is adjacent to another location that's kind of similar and and as matt indicated i'll just punctuate this it's an opportunity to make some economical use of the land where farming is just simply not a viable opportunity and again mr corey can fill in the testimony of steve corey and bob levy provides detailed evidence identifying the best location for the solar facility these landowners know their land and they as i said they were actively involved in site selection and design they chose the site based upon the fact that it is their poorest agricultural that it is in the heart of the wind generation generation facility therefore the least amount of impact on the surrounding lands as well it minimizes impacts on the land by transmission lines by roads it's very very close to their farm operations building so for multiple reasons this site makes a great deal of sense for the uh for these landowners cunningham ranch and pendleton so just to kind of wrap up here um this industry is still in its infancy and we understand the council is still kind of evolving how to deal with solar energy siding and you know we're in the industry we're we're trying to figure it out too and how the regulatory standards should apply so it's not surprising to us that the council has questions good to ask that we have a responsibility to answer and that's we are committed to do that and we will be committed for the next application and the next application in the next application because there will be more um and this is not going to end anytime soon what is important to us is that there be on how we meet goal 3 goals and standards and how that relates to and synchronizes with other very important state policies most particularly climate change and that is very much in our minds as we are working on these applications and working with these landowners the testimony from both mr levy and corey in fact touched on and believe me i didn't write this testimony for him but that their testimony touched on their responsibility and how they believe they can make very beneficial and important use of the land to deal with climate change goals that's a real issue for this family um they're very they're taking some responsibility for so here for this project we believe that we have struck the right balance with the evidence and the rationale to support the approval and we ask to approve this project an issue a proposed order at the conclusion of this hearing i have one little wrap up thing to do though on the two-mile setback if you like that from us right now and i'll start and you can correct anything i say matt all right um we are matt is i'm not working with the in order to um avoid locations it would be subject to the two-mile setback we're in a process of trying to figure that out we're not suggesting that anything be revised with a dpo right now we need to check in with the county particular on their strategy their standards for waivers or consents for locations that might be shy of the two-mile buffer area so i just want to kind of let you know that that's very much in the attention nolan hills to get that resolve to the county satisfaction and we believe we can do that but we'll need just a bit of time but we don't want to hold up this to do that so we would um our all right and i talked to mr cornett about this i think if if we're able to succeed in this effort we would essentially kind of just request that piece of the dpo be removed because we would be in compliance with the county yeah so so we heard from from mr jolly earlier and and i think not um his comments were echoed by the by the county and the county's comments are on the record they were submitted on may 26 and you know so we capital power we plan to own and operate this long term we want to be good members of the community within umatilla county and we want to work with the county to make sure that we can live within their standards we do need to understand you allowance for for landowners local residences to waive those setbacks which we don't have resolved today but i do want to put it on the record that you know capital power takes community engagement very seriously we want to be a good member of the umtil accounting community we will be coming before umatilla county for other approvals as well and we want to unders we want them to to know and recognize that this project which has evolved over time we have 112 turbines in this application 100 of those are outside two miles from a residence and so this project could be built tomorrow with those hundred turbines but we we want to analyze and confirm before we effectively give up on those other 12 turbines because they're on nice high peaks with good winds and things of that nature so it's a process that will be ongoing here and just as the f-sec historian here i will say that we are wanting to indicate in any way that the goal findings method of resolving these issues uh through local codes is is in any way uh something that we're not you know that we're giving up on or or that isn't that is not an important part of this process the point is for this project we think we can avoid doing that all right thank you so at this point i think i want to turn it over to council to see if they have any questions for the applicant comments they want to make and and give uh council an opportunity to you know kind of have that dialogue with the applicant this is hanley jenkins council member first question is you're not asking us remove the 12 turbines from consideration at this time we need need to still address them as if they're there in relationship to the two-mile setback okay you agree with that yes i'm i'm nodding so verbally that's correct thank you that's that's my first so my second question is completely different and um you asked the staff to provide us some excerpts from exhibit k we got a packet of maps in that packet of maps there is a right exhibit six uh figure p dash five and i won't make you go looking for it but um it includes um areas enrolled in the conservation reserve program lands and if i'm interpreting the site or the solar farm correctly it does that on this map it's not in the crp program is that because it's been more recently enrolled yes i yes i think that is the case mr jenkins and and steve cory knows all about this issue so but he probably didn't do the math yeah you probably didn't do the math and the map you know this application has been in the works for a very long time and so whether everything is currently shown as it is today is a question your oral testimony and your other written testimony clearly says it's into yes it is i got the map and i tried to superimpose the location on this i went but it's not on the map you you continue to have a very sharp eye yes thank you so it is in crp that's all thank you that's all i have thank you this is cindy condon and i have a thank you so in your last month the project one of the unique factors that was used used last month um was that the the project is solar wind and battery and that it's located proximate to transmission lines and a proposed substation at bpa and i am curious well in the it's as i remember the project is talked about in terms of phases is being done in phases so will every phase include batteries those three unique elements of battery storage solar and wind and additionally if bpa does not develop the substation proposed then so i think in within exhibit k there's reference to being within a mile of a bpm an existing bpa transmission line which is which is true our proposed interconnection to bpa which is in the application is further they want that substation to be north of the umatilla river for access reasons and so if that project sorry if that substation does not get built the alternative connection is either a smaller project to the existing bpa line a mile to the north or the uec transmission option which is the long 25 mile line that goes off the page so to answer questions about phases that is going to be somewhat dependent upon the commercial solution to this project which is not yet uh finalized and so ultimately we want to provide a product to a customer um who's willing to pay a certain amount resiliency and reliable power and so as of today and the reason we added solar in batteries that you need those all three components to get to that close to around the clock solution and that's not just the utilities in oregon but cni customers are also looking for that uh more reliable product and so ultimately we're going to build what we can sell and so if we cannot sell 600 megawatts",

        "text": " 80 megawatts and below however the standard contract for purper projects is three megawatts and under and had the ability to have a standard contract is the thing that allows a purple project to really move forward there are purple projects larger than three megawatts but it's a lot more challenging to get those done and thank you john for clarifying dual we are saying the same thing that solar is not allowed on high value farmland over 12 acres currently that is not a viable amount of space for solar right now and so my point was that dual use solar is not is not allowed practically because uh projects over 12 acres are not allowed and when we talk about in the especially in the willamette valley um it just means that solar is not getting built and the dewey julius isn't getting value we heard from pine gate that their project was 50 acres and even that was financially challenging um and so there's it's it is unrealistic to expect that dual use solar will happen under 12 acres thanks for that clarification uh yes rob if i could just just say one for two real real quick things i promise so thank you angela i appreciate um speaking to that point also also correcting me about about uh about purple i'm obviously not not an expert at all um and i just would add one additional thing is that um the exception process remains for um companies to to pursue for for larger projects being on 12 acres however uh if those of us have studied that understand that's that can be real challenging that's that that's there's no guaranteed outcome um so what we do see more often is is the 12 acre projects through the more simple conditional use process as opposed to the exception process which requires a plan amendment and um the rules that apply there have been awkward and awkward fits we tried we tried to we tried to get at it and then um with some legislation that would have us fix those uh to some extent and it kind of clapped in its own way but anyway thank you guys again i'll i'll go ahead and go back on me thank you i think we've got a couple more hands up though john um so dan you can go ahead i was gonna do your your question from the chat but you can go ahead and do it yourself if you want and then and then i'll get to mike um dan's question came into the chat before your hand came out like yeah sure um so john the way i read there's one clause in here i don't know what this number is 1a um which rules out the way i read it and i've read this law pretty pretty carefully multiple times rules out solar on high value farm ground at any size and that is the closet says except for electrical cable collection systems connecting the photovoltaic solar generation facility to a transmission line the project is not located on high value farm grounds on farmland soils and i'll just add that of the three counties in oregon that we've talked to about this two of them agree with my reading of it and one of them seems to be allowing solar on high value farm ground thanks dan i think you've read it i i would i think you've read it correctly i would offer um hopefully a little little context and an explanation um which kind of traces it back to the definition of high value farmland which you know land and attract contiguous land and track that is predominantly comprised of high-value farmland soils and high-value farmland soils are also uh and so what we have there and this is this is a product of our 2008 lcdc 2018 uh which says basically on the best of those high value farmland soils uh solar is not allowed except for the except for the gentile line i guess there's a cable connection um on on that particular subset of high-value soils now if they're not the only soils are high-value farmland soils but they are they are the best they are the best so i got it so so turn the corner on that a little bit you know there could be instances where um based on the actual types of soils on a track they're just it is unavailable for uh utility skills photo will take solar through the conditional use process another one maybe the one next door with different different types of soils you know could still be available could still remain a candidate for that type of a 12 acre conditional use process arrangement all righty maybe we go to mike you're on mute mike john can you elaborate a little bit on having to do with uh class high values farmland that uh it's any land that has water rights right correct i'm not quite not quite um many of especially as you get on the east side you know you have we have a lot of soils over here that are say let's say they're class six if they're dry which is basically a rangeland or dry land wheat uh which you're probably a lot more familiar with right um but if it's irrigated it might be bumped up uh to a class three um which may make it uh or class two um so um but not always you know there are some some some fair lands you know kind of i'm thinking of northern lake county which if irrigated go from a class six as dry land to class which is important but still not it's still not productive enough mostly through climates and other things uh to be considered high value uh in the in the in the wild valley uh it's less contingent on the presence of irrigation many of those soils are are high value regardless i guess the the the final point there is that irrigation is often a very important contributory factor for whether soil is considered high value or not but it's not always going to it's not always going to elevate that soil to make you know making the cut so to speak so irrigated land often is high value but not always all righty thanks john and representative owens thanks robin just to expand what john said that's my understanding too of high value farm ground class one and two has a lot to do with topsoil death and other things most of each in oregon southeast oregon does not have class one or two but when you look at it through a community lens or county lens with the added sighting authority that counties they're going to get a lot of pushback if they put them on irrigated ground it's happened in lake county it'll continue to happen because the communities will consider that high value farm ground even if the lcd on their classification of soils do not so i would highly recommend that we look at that from the county or community's perspective anytime anything's irrigated unless there's an absolute need to reduce water in that area then i think we can make a case for it thank you sir okay well that was a nice round up we're down to three minutes and i'm glad we were able to take some time to discuss that and um thanks john for taking the hot seat a little bit and thanks angela and representative owens and mike for for jumping in with some of those and and dan um that was that was useful to get a closer reading of that particular law and um you know like we say this is really what this work group is all about and ultimately for um boiling down these discussions into some thoughtful recommendations for the legislature so i hope everybody keeps that in mind as we wrap this meeting up and start our work for the next meeting on june 28th i think that with that i just want to thank everybody for attending and giving us your attention firsty i don't know if there's any other final final comments thank you all and we will see you on the 28th thanks everybody thank you thanks everyone i'll stick around when people fade out in case anybody has any questions concerns or anything uh yeah i just wanted to remember whether the chat is saved as part of the uh re you know as something we can access later yes all right thanks all just good to see you good job rob i'm gonna take you up thanks so thanks christy for helping to rock the whip that's always a hard part of these meetings so yeah you did a great job um i'll send you guys the chat right now um you'll get the uh recording probably or wait monday you'll get it it takes me it takes 20 minutes okay it takes 24 hours for it to download so nice job rob",

        "text": " objectives for zones throughout the park it also presents an overarching vision for those two properties From staff's perspective this project aligns with the overarching vision as expressed in that document and and as expressed by the CM community and again that vision is a place of active play family gatherings prote protection and enhancement of Oaks wild flowers and Pringle Creek Natural exploration a sense of history and areas of reflection the proposed baseball field Improv are located within designated uh Management areas that Focus specifically on Oak and CIS conservation importantly for this the city staff has determined that the project presents no harm to these elements I also want to highlight a little bit more about Community benefits the project prioritizes public use and enjoyment of the recreational facilities uh that that are compatible with this with the use going back to that it is an urban park the use Ed used being the baseball field has been there for a long time there's a focus on serving Salem's Ed in this project I just want to highlight that I first sat down with Luca Manuel over two years ago I looked through my emails this morning from that first day it's been been clear to me that his organization's one of their primary motivations is largely focus on serving the Salem's Youth and I believe this proposal is slated to do that and so with those kind of opening remarks I want to invite Rob passage from wam University to just provide an update about the the current and I believe uh final status of The Proposal that they're preparing to take forward very distracted so um thanks Rob I appreciate it um and this will pretty pretty short I know for most of the members we we had a conversation a couple months ago hope you had a chance to to go back and read through uh uh the the answers some questions that we provided to all of you um we' had a lot of good conversations with with folks of the city about this revised uh Amendment we' continue to have conversations with folks uh about walkthroughs of the space and so I just wanted to give you know just there's just a few slides we do now have some renderings um that I wanted to show folks in terms of what you know kind of what we hope this will will look like um and you read the Sal reporter uh in the last 24 hours you saw one of those one of those photos and there's a few more and so next slide uh again is just what uh this was from the last uh uh time we we chatted um you know the project we're trying to install syn Synthetic Turf Sports lighting uh is some protective netting at our baseball and softball field so I know for this group that we really only care about the baseball field and put be within B Park but it does also include our softball field next slide please so this is what I think was already Rob already repaired was already in there uh again just kind of showing that pink part is what we're asking for the uh the additional easement uh in this in this renegotiated or restated agreement uh with the city and then the next slide now this is the space that we're that we're talking about um this is the South edge of the stadium and again our hope uh is right now this is the storage space there there's no access um our hope is to connect basically the left field with the right field part of the stands and open up some new spaces for folks to view uh to view our games next slide and then this is a this is a a r a new rendering and so this shows um uh you know again kind of what we're hoping to do I will say one thing the netting will not be that dark I think they made it that dark so just you could you could see the outline of it um but basically um as we're as we're working through this this would be the path right up next to the the building that we're trying to bring around with the fencing uh to connect what would be right now this is currently fouled territory uh and some storage and we just want to create some again more spaces on both sides of the field and also some space out in left field uh where folks can uh can stand and watch the game if they don't want to sit in the stands they have an opportunity we all know how well kids like to just sit in the stands for for a baseball game and so it's really around for that a lot around families and have an ability people to go different places so that's an overhead view um uh if you can go to the next slide this is kind of um you know kind of ground level uh that we'd be looking at again that that area along the the back side of the stadium we'd be creating a new side uh new sidewalk inside adding this fence um for folks that have been there much nicer looking fence than what currently exists um and then rebuilding uh a path the current existing path right outside um of of that fence and the next slide this is a this is another look uh at the field from what will be uh grass berm uh in left field again some additional uh space that doesn't exist now for folks to watch not only baseball but but also track meets our track and football stadium are here um but that shows the lights uh the turf The netting um and uh and that's Rob just for clearity these spaces from this angle are all already L University property correct yes yep yeah if you get with with what Rob shared before is just that pink space What would be on the other side of be back so so that that is I just want to make sure I shared that with with the group um I know there will be you know U time for potentially time for questions and and you all need to have um your conversation again we're very excited about this project very excited about the impact some of the things that Rob shared about the opportunity for not only the baseball and the softball project and the impact you can have on the community uh as folks who have been not only those spaces but also making them available to the community and other organizations I feel like we've been good Shepherds of that space and worked very well with the city uh to make sure when we do have events that we're following uh the uh you know proper procedures I don't want put Becky on the spot but she's been been great she Melinda been great to work with um and I hope she would say the same about the same about me and other staff at w it uh for the events that we have that we have held so thank you for uh me this time to speak great thanks and I just have a little bit more before I hand it over uh back to you uh first I an item that's in the agreement that is not highlighted in the sap report um is is wind screens for the tennis courts at Bush's pasture Park uh L University is generously uh proposing to take over the maintenance and replacement of those windscreens as part of this agreement you know this is this is a small but meaningful thing from my perspective it's one less thing the city staff will have to maintain out there and again these are the wind screens that surround the tennis court I also want to talk about what's where we are in the process so this this is this is the beginning of what I see as a city review and approval process um if the board uh was in a position to advance this item uh to city council today it would then go to city council uh on June 25th uh that's at least what it's scheduled to do um at that point the city would then that that's for the agreement that's what we're talking about today is this this revised agreement uh following that the next day uh we would ask the city manager to co-sign their land use applications just like any other developer just like a park development they have to go through the city's land use development process there are two land use processes that will be uh submitted concurrently one is a site plan review with adjustments and so that is that is a a process that will go through the city's Lan use process also they'll have to do historic design L review that is a type three L use procedure which that means it is a big deal it will have a public hearing that public hearing will be at the uh historic landmarks commission and those two approvals will be then required for them to proceed uh with the project so so this agreement is one Element then there's these land use processes and I just want to highlight that and with that I uh chair Norris I'd be happy to to answer any questions excellent thank you rob um in terms of kind of our process here for considering uh our board's perspectives on the agenda what we'll do now is have some questions from the board to Rob any clarifying questions on this particular presentation then we'll have public comment we've got just three public comments signed up uh I believe um and so we'll have public comment period um and then we'll be able to uh discuss as a board kind of our approach uh moving forward with this uh with this decision item so with that does that process make sense everybody okay with that any clarifying questions ra I've got two first that I don't know that Rob can answer that are 90 foot high lights needed that's like 20t higher than the existing lights I believe so so currently what we have what our lighting company has expect out is 80 80 foot lights MH so um and and to avoid um so there's a couple different technologies that light and so there's a company called musco where they actually up light so baseballs fly high in the air um you want to be able to see The Baseballs at night and so lights typically are a little higher than they would be for the tennis courts or even the football even the football stadium or soccer field there are some companies that again like musco don't use up lighting um to be able to shine lights on the ball but the other thing that that does is it shines Lights of the year uh the company that we're going with uh and in some instances they'll use 74 points in some spots but then they upad the company that we're going with is using 80 foot poles so they can make sure that they get the coverage of the ball within the field itself but they're not providing any any light above the fixtures so that's that's why that's why the height and remember I'm just jump in there the height of the",

        "text": " as a medium one of those on the medium timeline so three to five years it was initially thought we would start looking at this we've learned recently that Eugene has moved forward just passed a ban in its natural gas starting this year on residential and that was low rise residential so nothing about three stories is my understanding and that was only new construction so not existing um so they are moving forward Milwaukee passed two resolutions earlier last year asking staff to come back with code um for uh to prohibit gas infrastructure again in residential and that's beginning in they also the second resolution was for City Gas systems that are failing to be replaced kind of electric and I think in some instances starting right away on that so A couple cities are looking at um I've not seen a whole lot at the state level here yet I know buildings and Energy Efficiency itself has been a big conversation topic there's a resilient buildings task force that's had a number of conversations the Oregon global warming commissions had a number of con conversations on building efficiency there's a few bills kind of on the table a couple that would prohibit local entities from from doing these kinds of prohibitions there's one in the other direction that would allow so not seeing a lot of movement on either of those yet but there's a number of conversations in looking I did see that Washington State just recently their State Building Code now requires in July of this year heat pumps for new residential and Commercial so there are some changes some people looking at this it's not one we've looked at yet and I Know It causes a number of concerns as as most of these in the high list probably will so it's kind of where we're at right now okay any questions or comments okay thank you all right uh next one mw23 enhanced the capture of Wastewater emissions um that was on our long-term list so greater than five years out this is one that I need to actually do a bit more research on you know as we just completed our admissions inventory we realized we're not releasing methane to the atmosphere from that process likely I think we thought previously and our missions are actually pretty darn low you know 5 000 compared to 1.2 million excuse my ignorance on this but isn't this what our Cogen facility does well and that was my initial thought as well I guess okay yeah yes it does and I think the reason this is high as Heather said is that when this list is first made out we had a very high Wastewater division rate based on the loan assumption that we missed okay someone thought we had living yeah I do have space for a second coach in it and so I'm not sure what our efficiency is on how much we're capturing now if there's more to be captured if we put a second coach now and my understanding is that the Cogen facility has challenges currently just because we're kind of yeah the new one that we put in is new generation and we've had a lot of ongoing mechanical issues with it so when it's up and running it's extremely efficient but we also have quite a few so it's a few years old now so maybe the technology was catching up and better but we did build a building margin to house a certain fund and I'm not sure like I said I'm not sure what our capture rate is are we all of it or I don't know the number and it might be a bit flawed because of the on-again off again of the actual running event right it would be I would like to know more about that on again off again business and take a look at that I would just like to know more about this whole thing yeah right like did this come from the assumption that we had lagoons if so do we need to reword this to be more specific about adding the same one or right like I this seems very yeah yeah so maybe mw23 is when we can take a deeper dive into to see like yeah counselor was saying is it is it relevant is there does it need to be reworked is it you know was it based on uh faulty information let's take a look let's take a deeper dive on that one okay just have to be careful when you're taking a deeper drive into Wastewater emissions so thank you for that cautionary note uh Mr city manager I appreciate that okay so we're halfway through this list um promote Energy Trust Oregon um programs for industrial and large commercial buildings um this one was um expected to start three to three to five years out so it's a medium one it seems very similar to the first one that we spoke of to me where we're just promoting their programs in general although I do think if we're if we're targeting Industrial and Commercial businesses it our Outreach probably needs to be a bit more targeted as well and that's something that like you said Lisa might have Lisa and other staff at the city might have more and maybe a conversation with said core too to get them engaged and to make sure that yeah so it to me it seems like we had a um 32 and 35 together and not yeah there's some seems like there's some opportunities there on both of those so that makes sense so that one we could potentially move move forward sooner great okay Ian 30 and en9 these are the two that although they're worded slightly differently and they um they actually had different timelines to start um I did confirm they're the same task um so work with PGE to design and adopt a community-wide clean energy program or a green power rate as cn30 says so PGE actually came and I think it was the same meeting that Energy Trust joined and they gave a very high level overview of what is a new um potential umbrella green tariff program that's actually been kind of baked into house bill 2021 and that's the the bill that set pretty stringent clean energy targets for Pacific Power in PGE so this community supported Renewables tariff program is in that film language as well as an option for the utility stick to come up with and what that would be for communities is it is a higher rate if a community is interested and we sign we go through and sign a participant participation agreement with PGE that's pretty detailed then we would potentially have a higher rate across the city that would be an opt out for folks so it would require again a lot of communication a lot of discussion up front and then there were you know folks of low income would not be they would be automatically enrolled without the extra fee it's my understanding but there's a lot of details that PG is still working to work through so we met with PGE recently a few of us and they confirmed that the program is still under development they're still working through the bones of what this tariff might look like the next step as I understand PGE submits to the Oregon Public Utilities Commission their clean energy plan which outlines their plan forward to meet The Targets in House Bill 2021 and I think it is supposed to include kind of the basic framework for this Doterra program as well so once that plan is submitted and they'd mentioned March so I need to keep my eyes open see if that gets submitted I think it's going to be several months is what they're expecting before the puc would approve that plan in a program and then they would start having conversations with communities individual communities um in PGE and Pacific Power service territory to see if to gauge interest in this tariff program for their community so it would need to be approved by a city council before it would even need to go okay so we'll stay tuned to see what that work looks like at the at the puc level yeah I'm going to start watching and see when that gets submitted and and checking in with kind of other folks other cities are watching us as well what would the money go brain energy efforts yeah there's there would be still being fleshed out but basically to some to support local renewable energy projects and I think that could be like hyper local potentially like in Salem um some small scale projects maybe like with battery I think we could you know depending on the agreement we could potentially work with PG and kind of focus areas of where they might go if we so choose otherwise money can just go to you know kind of more Regional projects it's really I think right now sounds pretty darn flexible yeah something we'd want to work through um in pretty good detail so interesting thank you all right so en14 third from the top a weatherization prioritizing low income and that was low-income renters homeowners and businesses for the full language um this one was on our early implementation list I didn't pull it over to our work plan primarily because this because the city is not really the lead in this one at this point so development of a new weatherization program kind of at least the way the strategy was written really hinges on healthy homes program funding which the Oregon Health Authority will be administering that program they're still finalizing the program details it looks like they anticipate having grant funding available later this year for local agencies that are interested in administering local programs but it's not yet available when I spoke to Mid Willamette Valley Community Action Agency last year they were interested in applying I haven't touched base with them for several months but this information was also forwarded to the Housing Authority as well as Marion County and they've kind of expressed interest I don't know if they have capacity as well for this kind of program but it's not presently something that at least right now that the city is planning to kind of administer on our own so it's hopefully moving forward soon and we'll keep checking in with our partners in the community but it's not something that we're taking the lead on right now no um this one here I know the CD is not taking the lead and Community Action has for years had this program but I think it'd be nice to sort of um eventually start Gathering all the players together to know what's happening I mean just this morning there was a report I'm not sure which European country I forgot the low income a lot of people's um ability heating bills have doubled and they've had to create warm zones for people so 300 sites around the country that's for people to be warm during the day after their kids get out of school and before they go to bed and because they just can't afford to heat their house and a lot of it was if you just hear them it was weatherization related one lady was saying how a draft comes through her house",

        "text": " chapter that's similar to that that outline Washington's this is just using the State of Washington's example which is also based on standard 100 had a similar framework where their sections of administrative rule are each based on the chapters and the sections of ashery standard 100 so our plan is to do similar and you know what's what's in the standard itself the language of the standard after we met at standard 100 after we modify it for Oregon will essentially become the uh the Oregon so our plan is for the rules to follow that same general structure as ashray standard 100 2024 version similar to Washington States if here's a link to Washington's if you want to just to to look it over to get a preview of what organs might look like uh we do recognize as we go through that some chapters are going to be straightforward and non-controversial While others will be more involved and require more discussion so well as we go through it we'll try to identify those areas and plan more time and more input opportunities um and with that that is that concludes uh my section and Wendy's section of the presentation U before I hand it over to to Sean Denniston with the new buildings Institute to kind of walk through ashray standard 100 um I'll just mention again that we we've got the comment portal open um and these are the questions that we've asked with this first round just to kind of give you a preview so you know one we've kind of shaped the questions um to kind of mirror the agenda today but you know do you have any general comments on on building performance standards and their planned application in Oregon do you have any comments on oo's planned process for stakeholder engagement for ruem um through the ru making advisory committee and general public stakeholder meetings oh I didn't mention it before but um the ru making advisory committee is made up of certain um sector you know certain representations certain perspectives um as defined in the bill there were six different um six different categories that that needed to be included in the rack but we've got a broader rack than that I think we have about 14 or 15 members on it and kind of expanded it a little bit um to include a number of different perspectives too um those rule making advisor committee meetings will be open to the public to to call in and view um if you'd like but then uh Wendy mentioned it before we will be kind of taking the output of those rack meetings um you know one rack meeting or two rack meetings and consolidating it and then bringing that output and kind of what came out of the the the focused rack meetings to the general public in a future broader public stakeholder meetings so certainly welcome to attend the rack meetings and listen in but you'll know that there'll be another opportunity after that for more input through the general public meetings but um do you have any comments on our our planned process for stakeholder engagement um do you have any comments on ashray standard 100 2024 at this point and its application for Oregon um and then the last question is are you interested in being involved on an advisory committee for tier 2 building so those were the multif family uh schools hospitals dorms and universities and if so uh please provide like which sector and organization you represent and we'll be taking those those comments um as we form that tier two R making advisory committee and here's another link to the comment portal too which is also up on our website and with that um that concludes my section of the presentation so I'll stop sharing my screen and see if Sean if you're able to uh to take over sharing at this point Thank You Blake yep we will do the standard Shuffle yeah make sure that you can hear see and the right thing we can hear you yeah just fine so that's a right so are we seeing the right thing I think so yep I see your title slide great well thank you everyone so my name is Sean Dennison I'm an associate director for codes and policy with new buildings Institute and we are helping out with this process of adopting this of turning this BPS legislation into actual policy that is enacted in the state of Oregon and my role here today is to give an introduction to standard 100 since it plays such a big part of this policy and it is mentioned specifically in the legislation for adoption and so we want to get introduced this group to the standard what's in it and what it entails to adapt this for Oregon's use and Oregon's building performance standard so we'll start with an an overview of ashray standard 100 uh we'll talk about some lessons learned from Washington's adaptation of standard 100 for their Statewide BPS and then we'll talk a little bit about the specifics and what this means for Oregon and Oregon's use of standard 100 and I think one of the things that we want to start with is that many of you are probably familiar with standard 100 or you might not be but up until up through the 2018 version of standard 100 it was really focused on providing a tool directly to building owners for how they can manage and maintain their buildings to achieve certain energy Target certain levels of efficiency in their buildings however it became quickly evident that a lot of what was in standard 100 was very useful for jurisdictions that are looking to adopt a building performance standard so in 20124 we see a shift a lot of modifications were made to Ash ashray standard 100 to make it serve that purpose better but as we're going through this and looking at how we can use standard 100 in Oregon you can see that there are still a little bit of this dual identity in the 2024 version so that even though now you know this stated purpose of standard 100 is to provide a code ready building performance standard it still has a lot of these elements from that older Life as a way to really provide for the maintenance and operations of existing buildings and that old Target of building owners so as we look at the transition to 2024 we can see that there are a bunch of modifications including a revised scope that includes BPS elements uh we see the addition of greenhouse gas metrics and targets since so many jurisdictions are looking uh to go that Direction with their bps's an appendix that's added a added to guide custom Target development which will be very relevant in Oregon and US Regional energy conversion factor so you know some more technical content a prescriptive path for buildings that don't have eui targets which is something that can be very important for BPS and then of course updating all of the eui targets uh based on new data from the commercial building energy consumption survey that's what CeX means and the residential energy um consumption survey uh so that's residential building so updated targets since the Targets in the older editions were based on some older data and then some additional building types and climate zones so we see these kind of General advancements in the standard but then these expansions that really make it work better for a BPS and so we're going to go through and really see what is in there what's the meat of the standard you can see here this is pulled straight from the title The the table of contents these are the main sections that are in the standard and then there's a whole bunch of appendices some of them are normative you'll see that on the first three and some of them are informative normative appendices are appendices that are considered part of the standard so when you adopt the standard or when you use the standard these are really considered integral parts of the standard and then the informative ones are providing additional information to anyone who's using the standard however since Oregon is adopting this Oregon has the flexibility to choose which of these appendices get adopted and how they get adopted now going back to the main body you'll see that some of these sections are really core to the nature of a BPS like we were talking about before and so we've highlighted them here the purpose the scope the definitions the compliance requirements energy use Target requirements implementation and verification requirements well some of the other sections while are very useful to existing buildings and could be a good part of a really robust BPS implementation or maybe a little bit less poor to using ashray as a as a building performance standard and we see the same thing in the appendices some of them are really core to using the standard as a BPS and some of them are useful to using the standard as a BPS and so we're going to talk a little bit about the ramifications of that as we go through so I want to just Note One Thing early on which is definitions know standard 100 has definitions and some of these definitions are really important and need to be reconciled with the Oregon's legislation to make sure that the terms are defined the same way uh but you know we have some of the ones that a lot of people are probably used to have seen before energy use intensity eui or eui Target however it has other terms that are really about how a BPS operates like a qualified person this often becomes a really critical piece in how you implement a BPS who is qualified to do certain tasks and so we also have definitions like these and might have to modify or even add additional definitions to be critical to they play a critical role in making sure that the BPS operates smoothly uh and we'll just kind of keep going through Section by section so that you can see what's in there we will not be reading text but I want you to see what the text looks like so as we get into section four it's compliance requirements so what's in this section it's really wayfinding it tells you which buildings comply with which requirements Now Blake gave you a really good breakdown of tier one and tier two and the timelines that's the sort of information that would generally be found here in this fourth section it tells the buildings it'll lay out you know what is the building threshold for size what are the building types and which one which of the requirements throughout the rest of the standard will actually have to be uh those buildings will need to comply with so it's it's you can almost see it as the way finding the the traffic cop that sends you through the various sections section five is an emissions and energy management plan again you can see you know nice dense text that",

        "text": " in Mississippi for example yeah so 652 500 yeah so just interested on you know what kind of cuts well then if that seven percent is like you're saying is for existing phases and then what we're gonna have to do to re-group on the set of projects for the new fate we're noting the question okay thank you thank you for asking are there any other questions out there in Zoom land not at this time Joe Harrington thank you Brenda so I'm just gonna Echo what Frank said and again it's the current misstep projects what kind of impact is is are there going to be and if there is and we need to get word as fast as possible well luckily it's not as bad as a still I've been sitting on eggshells since the last week of September knowing that with the severity of the jail HVAC system we might have to close the jail down with like 24-hour notice where in the world are we going to find a place to put 700 adults in custody it's not like we can just turn around and put them in hotels we learned as a state what happens when during Wildfire smoke prisoners right from the prisons even higher Security even more restrictive conditions have to be moved around it's not pretty so that's why I feel very I wouldn't say comfortable about contemplating this stuff but I feel that it is my responsibility to go through these thought exercises because there's a reason why the Erp hasn't been even thought about and I think that all of us as elected officials we know we know we have our term we know and what what we all want to do is leave whatever responsibility we have in better shape than than it came to us and to address the problems and that's that's really what this budget is about it's like it's it's turning it's trying to turn the ship around a bit on some pretty significant philosophies around being a low-cost County versus making sure that we are a county that addresses what our issues are so commissioner Rogers go right ahead thank you and thank you to ask questions though you only get to contribute to the oh I only have I can't contribute to the conversation no that's what we definitely want you to do oh okay all right uh first of all uh thank you for attending everyone I apologize I can't be there in person tonight my wife is having a little about with kidney stones and I feel I need to be a little close to home some of the things that we're discussing tonight have not been discussed at any budget level at the county as you heard previously and there are some major issues that I don't know they're going to come up tonight but I think if I were in a city again and I started my career I'd be curious about one of them has been brought up as a misstep um the reason the only reason misstip is a part of the general fund is I I many years ago I got a call from Tom Bryan who then subsequently became our chair but is the state legislature and he called and said Roy um would you like misstep not to have to be voted on every three to five years would you like it to to come through measure 50 because he was the head of Revenue and would that be a good alternative and I said yes were you tired of going back and spending the money at The Ballot Box so that's how I missed it became a part of permanent Levy it was never envisioned that it would ever not be used for roads in totality by any board that I've served on so I we all can have respectful disagreements but uh I too am very concerned anything would be changed in our commitment to our partners because that was the only way that Mischief got got approved was through a definite partnership with the city so that's a misstep issue one of the things that Catherine and I have been in total agreement on and working I think with the rest of the board and I think they're there too is that we really have always said the cities are the best servicer of of many of the things they're provided to our citizens I'm I'm excluding Parks I'm not going there I'm just saying the things that uh you know we think of a common city services uh we're not for pardon me for forced annexation but one of the interests you might have and for the future is that we've never really costed our services out to those unincorporated areas and that's an interesting study that we're going to Embark upon and it needs to be done because frankly cities shouldn't be subsidizing unincorporated areas nor unincorporated areas subsidizing cities so we need to know that answer we've always just said should we go through an annexation effort and that's not been really what anybody want to do we wanted to have a position of taking and looking at what are those costs so the chair and I have been advocates for that and I think that's something the city shouldn't be very interested in another one that I'm interested in and nobody's brought up is we tried it before and I know we've had major comments about it I happen to live where I'm talking to you from right now at Bull Mountain which is in Tigard we have areas outside of Tualatin which Frank can attest to when I was mayor down there that we're running cars from Hillsborough to to uh to the southern part of our County and is there some amount of of uh I guess franchising if you want to call it that as poor term for it but we could at least talk with our city Partners about services that we may purchase uh from you uh and that dialogue needs to happen because there's there's a lot of things that are pretty silly that we're replicating and I I found that to be a problematic and I don't think our board is too concerned about that as well so I would encourage our city partners and our special service districts there's a place for everybody but I think we need to have a dialogue about what the county does because we're in a very big part of what you do but frankly we're a competitor in certain areas and we don't need to be and and we can talk about how we're maybe shouldn't be and I think that's the dialogue that needs to start happening so I'll stop with that but I want to get those comments in anybody else have one another question don't want to belabor the point that's for sure I really appreciate those of you who have mentioned that this was useful uh thank you very much we took a risk didn't want to bore you to death but we also wanted to give you a flavor for what were the situation we're finding ourselves in the great work that staff has put in to give us a proposed budget and how we're trying to follow through and act on adopting a budget for this fiscal year and on into the future so I know our our conversation and serving our communities will continue please know that you can share more questions with us the slides had that email address that I'm not going to remember right Finance underscore budget at washingtoncountyor.gov that's Finance underscore budget um so and of course uh if you have any feedback about what could have made tonight better like I really wish the timing wasn't so constrained with your budget work as well because my preference would have been for us to go through those Department budgets this next week and then convened together so you have the situation but we would also we at least the Commissioners we haven't even had two weeks with the budget right it's six days old yay the six day old baby yeah yes yes yeah you know in the future I I'd also like to see this interchange be what are your constraints what are you what are you facing where are your pains so that so that we're learning as well so maybe that's something that we can we can work on in the future so as you're going through your budget process this year maybe write a note to you know so next year when we start talking with the board about the county budget you'll have your list already already made you know you can theorize ahead of time if you continue to have similar sorts of things or if it's going to be a variation on a theme but yeah it would be really useful to know so thank you commissioner Rogers for uh commenting earlier and uh sharing your thoughts with the whole group thank you for those of you who are on zoom and I really want to once again would you like to say anything commissioner Willie thank thanking them or anything for coming yeah it's been an hour and 46 minutes I haven't said a word so you know I think that could be a new record um now as I was listening to your um chair this has been really good but I think the the ending message is that this is not over June 30th when we adopt this budget we go into another siege meaning your your date of July 1. um we're going to need to have continue to have these conversations with all of our municipalities and partners in Washington County into next year because um we'd love to say this is this is all there is we've accomplished the task we're done we that everything looks good it does not and we know that and so the demand for these Services is continuing and the funds are continuing to lag behind and so we're going to need to have this conversation going into the fall and certainly next winter on how best we do this so thank you for being here and I feel really blessed to have the colleagues that I do to do that problem solving and to have these conversations with so I think that that says something that we're all very comfortable working with one another and really want to make sure that we you know make the most of the years ahead of us so thank you again drive safely home I hope your budget Seasons go smoothly as well it's really tremendous work that you do in service to our communities thank you again for coming tonight",

that are already benefit there they'll find the benefits to to move forward in the decision making so that's really what my comment was going to be and thank you thank you and appreciate everyone being patient with some of my comments i appreciate the the dialogue on this on this topic so what i'm hearing is that you know there are certainly an rto would take offshore wind as the example there are new opportunities as nicole mentioned sort of with a regional uh demand and potential new investment but some of the challenges still remain in terms of need to reinforce and upgrade transmission and their sighting and permitting challenges and uh those challenges don't go away um even though there's this new opportunity and potential new investment not that they can't be overcome but they're still real i'll leave a moment here if there are any other questions or feedback on this general topic otherwise i will suggest we take our 10 minute break now and then come back i will see everyone in 10 minutes i will put up a break screen with a start time it's just shy of 10 20. if you could turn on your camera just to let me know that you're i know a lot of folks have issues there once i see a few faces i'll assume we're all mostly back all right thank you ravi all right well thank you everyone let's uh move on with the agenda and uh just a reminder um as we as we go uh if you can use the hand raised function uh it was a good suggestion we should have been using it from the beginning but we will continue to try and lean on that for the remainder of the meeting and with that we'll jump into the uh next question uh so question number eight was around environmental impacts so question 8 was um my screen's cluttered here let me get to slide uh aggressive carbon policies are already in place across the west of course including oregon particularly with hp 2021. um so some of the literature uh found that it was unlikely that rto formation would significantly accelerate the reduction in carbon emissions and that there are other potential environmental considerations resulting from rto formation uh so again a similar kind of prompt question we had for the previous topics around looking for feedback on how the environmental impacts resulting from rto formation water would not be preferable to the status quo a few subtopics around thermal dispatch the geographic footprint of renewables development environmental justice and greenhouse gas accounting so again feel free um as i go through the individual slides if you have a particular comment or issue you'd like to raise feel free to raise your hand uh otherwise i'll try to get through the topic and then we'll have the discussion slide at the end like i've been doing um so general feedback uh overall multiple commenters disagreed uh with the statement uh derived from the literature that it is unlikely that rto formation would significantly accelerate reduction in carbon emissions compared to the status quo uh multiple commenters cited reduced curtailment of renewables more efficient dispatch of thermal and the ability to better share resources across the wide one commenter noted that states generally have not identified how state clean energy policies would actually interact or be implemented within rto and multiple recent studies have identified that achieving state clean energy targets is quote predicated upon the existence of a fully integrated regional grid so several of those recent studies have a used assumption of a fully integrated regional greatest baseline for their no impact one commenter offered that it is probably unlikely that an rto formation would have much influence on environmental aspects in the electric sector and cost optimization one commenter emphasized that rto markets are focused on finding the most economic and reliable solution to serve load and are not the best vehicle for pony one particular state's policies over another thermal dispatch state mandates rto formation would not preempt or otherwise undermine existing state laws such as the coal phase out adopted by oregon's sp 1547 for example inefficient thermal operation of an rto would reduce the dispatch of the most inefficient costly and ghg-emitting thermal units one commenter noted that a recent technical study identifies a continued need for gas as a capacity resource through 2045 but then having an rto will ultimately help to facilitate the replacement of that capacity at least and sound rto design can minimize the dispatch of thermal units and ensure that rto markets avoid an outcome of diminishing diminishing the target environmental outcomes of existing and any short-term increase dispatch of thermal units should be evaluated against the long-term benefits of rto next land use impacts of renewables overall multiple technical studies have identified that rto formation would allow for a smaller land use footprint for renewables development to meet state clean energy targets but it's complicated uh while an rto might result in less land use impact overall across the region it could shift the locations of land use development for renewables so perhaps more appropriate to consider this through state and local land use planning instead of rto design existing processes rto formation would not eliminate or otherwise impact existing federal and state siting and permitting requirements for generation and transmission and then environmental justice one commenter suggested that it would not be possible to evaluate this issue absent in rto market design while others an rto could more effectively facilitate der deployments which states could leverage to support projects in environmental justice communities optimizing the efficient use of generation transmission would lower cost for all which would have a disproportionate positive impact in communities with higher energy burdens rto developments one commenter contends that environmental justice and equity considerations quote should absolutely be considered in the planning for an rto and that states should assert their authority over companies with a financial interest in rto formation to ensure that these considerations are appropriately addressed in rto design an alternate view a multi-state rto cannot drive a single state's policies particularly with regard to environmental justice and these issues may be best addressed by pucs and this is i think the last sub-topic here before the discussion slide ghg uh lack of consistency most commenters are in agreement that states with ghg policies have inconsistent ways of tracking emissions and attributing emissions to sources one view is that this lack of consistency should be addressed in rto2 designed to develop a consistent regional mechanism in parallel with market design and they would developing such a mechanism as one of the central promises of a new western rto another view uh one commenter argued rto formation in the northwest would not be to quote create a new policy construct to accommodate state ghg objectives and the the kaiso and the new england iso have established robust solutions that accommodate disparate state ghg policies a third view while improved regional ghg accounting could be a beneficial outcome of an rto design it is quote not a fundamental cost of compliance the cost of compliance with a particular state's ghg policy should be allocated to the customers of that state and not passed on to members in other states and then here are um a few uh principles for gsg accounting than one commenter suggested that should be included in rto design record retention retention policies for documents relating to accounting and verifying ghgs uh transparency and accounting including reporting data and sharing uh scheduling allowing scheduling coordinators to incorporate ghgs and energy sourcing and dispatch for all power transactions including the source of power bought and sold uh clear guidelines for how to treat ghg tracking from unspecified power and development of gsg tracking report that includes accounting for state here we are on the discussion slide go ahead and find the hand raised function if you'd like to weigh in while i kind of prompt these questions here again the first one saying we've had do you support or oppose a particular perspective represented would you emphasize something differently is there something missing and then a particular question on gsg impacts um i know this was multiple commenters um took issue with uh one of the findings from a literature review um so the question i had is would rto formation actually accelerate ghg reductions or is the perspective that it would help states like oregon meet its existing ghg reduction policies more cost effectively so perhaps the argument is that states couldn't actually meet their ghg policies absent in rto i'm just trying to get some clarification there on sort of the perspective equity and environmental justice while rto shouldn't be evaluated as a tool to solve all the industry's as we've discussed many times already to what extent should equity environmental justice concerns be fundamental considerations when evaluating potential rto formation for example ensuring that historic injustices aren't exacerbated by rto and i will open it up for discussion and please use the hand raise function on the to get us started thanks adam so um i wanted to point out that the question on i think the very first slide that says that you know several states have aggressive clean energy standards so how would this how would having an rto result in anything better or uh i don't remember the exact question but i just want to point out that having a clean energy standard is not the same as meeting the clean energy standard and that uh there have been several deep decarbonization studies done in the region there was a regional one done a few years back washington did one um just last year when they updated their state energy strategy and there was one done in oregon just recently and all those studies modeled the ways that the states could meet their clean energy standards but they were all of the the sort of options were predicated on the on the existence of a regional market so we don't have um an analysis right now other than the state-led study which is not on a really a a very fine-tuned state by state basis that shows us uh you know how or what the challenges to meeting those clean energy standards without a regional market would be um because all the assumptions have been that there would be one in place so just to point that out thank you nicole looking for other hands raised here everyone's gotten shy after our 10-minute break uh there we go uh ben and then mary so i just want to kind of point out in our draft power plan we do definitely item calling for more research on siding i think one of the things most people don't realize about the northwest power act is it set up a system where it comes to hydro or we have kind of protected waterways",

        "text": " to highlight good practices practices and also Well I want to talk of some works that are under the dickens supervision hire illicit contractors CD Colombia TR systems Let me share with you a work incident that happened in a main area of \u200b\u200bthe center there was a worker who called me in the middle of the Christmas had been without pay for six weeks what a way to spend the holidays nothing plus that without another worker your direct his wife was in the hospital and he was still trying to recover from the lost wages these people work 10 to 12 hours a day with 120 per in cash per day if they divide it like 11 per hour think about that economy inflation what it did to you what it does to you to a single family provider and that still breaks me more The heart is Those workers have to talk Because of their status they feel trapped used and treated as a product Just to get the job done It sounds like exploitation of workers I even felt worse when worker told me it was the first time when I spoke with the supervisor of dickens they washed their hands of me They said it wasn't their problem and that it wasn't It was within his reach and no one I was paying for that, if not whose problem en I hope that when I'm standing here it is night that now that I am here in this room with local leaders that when the workers are paid in cash and below the mass let's call what it is they are treated as if not I hope they exist as I stand here in this room among you that we can develop a plan truly do questions about dien And if this only benefits them and what contributes to Salem and does not ally with the Salem values \u200b\u200bthis question for for the advice is not this that it is not your problem So whose is it we want that when our community was built workers like me are protected Thank you for the next testimony Trump thank you Council District 6 is here to put me 3.3a \u200b\u200bI am here to talk about myself to the 10-year tax credit because this project requires hand standards work the values \u200b\u200bjustice in equality and respect for all workers and provide this tax credit to projects without labor standards We are essentially endorsing a system that exploits workers with unfair salaries or even not is taking into account the security considerations let's think about the economic implications of everything This is if a tax credit can stimulate investment and potentially create jobs in the short term term But at what cost without standards of work becomes scenes of crime payment in cash to That's a problem with which community will deal with in the following years This is going to damage the local economy and this proposal can establish a dangerous president if we are missing Prosecutors, we lack prosecutors with projects with better standards and if this is gives these companies what they are going to have the other companies not to do this in the future this takes us us drag down where business companies compete not how have your quality your product service but they compete on how much they can squeeze and remove the worker and a Although the tax credit can be a powerful tool to stimulate economic growth must use responsibly No we should sacrifice standards of mana to open for it is short term and let's use tax credits better to maintain the standards of the work to create a situation of Victory for the workers for the companies in our economy and if anyone including the mayor or the citizen council wants to see the proof what I'm talking about I'm talking I have the videos thanks available for your testimony Steve Dion go ahead Okay please press the green button before starting I am I am I would be happy to talk to you after the meeting about what was discussed here That's really what I came to talk about. a topic we can't talk about in in this Ah we are developers department that is next to the Old nordstrom building and want say that the relationship we had with the city During this project it was Wonderful in terms to teamwork and getting things done together you will be proud of how you did it they do and in today's market it is extremely important to have these types of focus associations partner we are here to talk about the extension of taxes we are proposing of 105 million and I can tell you that for my experience in riverwood which is norstrom side without the tax incentive or tax extension we would not have built the project and now since we started the project 2 ago years Financing costs they have risen to double what they were when we start on project on site nordstrom So having some kind of association or Alliance is very important for us and for the projects functions aller We had a meeting at night and each developer has has different projects So I think your approach is good and without him The comment was, well, what does the city \u200b\u200breceives 16 units multifamily or affordable housing that otherwise I wouldn't do what I would makes our project is that it decreases the true value for 1.5 million dollars and also compensated by the 10 year tax extension then yes allows us to see the project from the perspective of moving forward so I'm here to answer I don't know If you can ask questions here or respond but we hey we signed up to testify here Yes they can ask you questions but I would like to ask or I mean we are not going to ask very long questions but yes We have questions about the testimony we can do but I would like to ask about the comments before you If you can address them, maybe not here. But allegations were made. serious then help me understand What point are and how we see them resolved problems the prevailing wage is that of union we hire a construction company that has been in business since 1914 are not one contractor per union So no the union salary sometimes more than times less I don't think that relating the tax selection with salaries have something to see I think would relate to the home that is what the statute is about then eh yes They want to relate it to salaries of the union is the same as salary of the union is the prevailing wage which is another different layer and is part of the reasons why it is done when they do these housing projects affordable cost 1.5 times so much the same than anyone living in the market but also because we use the figure of the prevailing salary but if it is necessary compare apples to apples the shape in how you approach the project because yes there would not be different recos without make sure there is a contract balance When we have the industry affordable unit we have a program financing of the tax increase that not available in all projects I don't know if I help them explain it But well I understand what says there was a suggestion that not They have labor standards and They were employing subcontractors They were obviously paying cash. which leads to problematic behavior any answer if we knew it is yes We would know that was happening No. would allow subcontractors would carry out that type of practices then What are the labor standards that you follow or if we want to understand what are the labor standards is State use another code that governs it It is definitely State law and Compared to the union that has its own defined standards each of companies and a large part of subcontractors are unionized It doesn't matter if they are a union eh worries that people do a good job work with a good reputation at a fair price is our standards are dictated by competition in and what it takes eh good to find the people these days are workers then everyone I can tell you Our Company I am in the health program and sure just like the carpenters workers is an excellent program and maybe we don't have a written manual let me tell you this is what you have to do because we allow each company Determine what is best for them to hire people competitive So I can tell you what What Our Company Does but we do not dictate to other companies what What do they have to do? I think it's worth it. It is also worth mentioning that in the sand of construction in the United States approximately 90 percent of the workers or work do it way we describe it 10% is the It seems like the prevailing salary to me. So yes it can be a little distorted if people present it Like, this is the standard, well, it's not. What is the standard is called the standard but it is not because the other 90 Yes It also counts and 0% of the work not under standard deo cre requirements have a couple of questions more Yes, thank you very much Mr. Mayor Jos\u00e9 gonz I'm in district 5 I'm construction industry advisor On the one hand it is financially difficult and On the other hand physically it is difficult and It is true that many people in the Latinos are promised cash and left hanging there happens more than the people might think assuming that we have here a process like a question let's say that one of the subsidiaries are not paying someone for the work done So what how in them to have the following process or for example stays with that subcontractor or leadership what can we do In that situation what can we do because these projects that happen in the center and are very important can be see spotted can see and can hurt people in the community well first of all I want to tell you that in the project we did for I haven't heard anything from you in Salem. about it and bringing a project and me I'd love to talk about it but can be suspended project or put a lien on the project for non-payment and I I'm also wondering if I could I don't know if I would have misunderstood because our How many of the workers in These projects are used and how many of them are employees of a subcontractor then really huh Would you like to see the video of which this gentleman spoke at least find out if this is an employee of a subcontractor or dicken None of the employees on the project they are from dicken we hire dolky construction they are the contractor and they hire the subcontractors and we are the project developer we do not we have employees construction because uh I you mentioned my carpenters my yes we were talking about a project in Portland and not I know what project it is eh And it is a",

        "text": " individual positions at the moment. Right. And included in that agenda item that we will bring to you will be the actual creation of the positions. Okay. That are not reflected here. And 170,000 is about three months of the salary. Where do you have that accounted for? Nowhere. It's spread out amongst all of the positions in the. I believe it's a position 40,000, you said, in salaries and then the requisite benefits and benefits, yeah. $170 amount for three months worth of staffing? Yes. Okay. Anything else? Well, I was just going to speak to a comment about work orders at the library. We funnel our work orders through one or two people so that we don't have duplicate work orders. And we also meet with it once every two weeks. To go over work orders and status. And try to stay on track. So that's just an update. Is that working well for you? Yes. Okay. Yes. That process, are you having to tweak things as far as work orders, did they go through your whole system with the right checks and balances? Do you feel. Or do they get stopped at the wrong point? Or how's that working for you? I don't have an opinion on that. You don't have an opinion. How far the operations guy. Oh, it has been working really, really good. We have good checks and balances. All right. Is that a good nod? A good nod. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Any other questions? Where's Jenny? But she did. She did get promoted. I saw that. Give her my best, please. Very good. Thank you all very much. Thank you. The last person. Save the best for last, as always. Right. Last person on our agenda today. Jared Goodspeed, facilities director. Here's my red pen. I've been looking forward to this all day. All right. Jared Goodspeed, facilities director. Who wrote this for you? To my right, I brought Samantha Richard, the brains of our operation. I was told I had to say that today, so I did. What's that? No, it's real facilities. I want to start off first by thanking the board. We've come to you multiple times. I've been here for six years of mid year adjustments. And always reflecting on some of the changes we have. Whether it's a push for capital improvement or sales tax passing. So first, want to say thank you for understanding the complexity of what we do. And the forward thinking needed to get the job done on time. So our department manages over 370 county owned buildings. 3.4 million occupied space. And we do everything from the day to day maintenance and the upkeep on those assets. To in house remodeling. And managing all the capital improvement for Marion county. Over the past year, our department has seen an increase for in house construction, remodeling. As that relates to capacity changes. These are large entities that really affect the critical nature of our services. From law library to it. Many elected officials, fire department. We've handled a lot of that. With the small projects team. That we've built over the last year and a half. So thank you for that. We continue to work on those. We've prioritized our project management team recently. With the addition of an assistant director to focus on those projects. So again, thank you. I think we're poised in a really good position moving forward. No matter what challenges we see or just continue to strengthen our, our goals, which are retention, focus, capacity, and then our technician efficiency on our work orders. So our budget begins on page 70, and we will go over some of the major changes. For fiscal year 25, the facilities management budget is increased at 2.03% over the past year. And again, that is. What was that again, 2.03%, which again, is not a large increase. We are making adjustments every year to where we're spending. You're going to start seeing a lot more. 95, 96, 90% expended. Not 80 or 70. And if we do, we make the adjustments accordingly. So the majority of those changes were for three additional ftes. It's two technician positions. One is a plumber and one is an additional support system at the courthouse. And there's also an addition of an additional supervisor for the operations. A few funds that are affected by communication and just changing out some of our equipment are communication services, 541101 and 552116. Those are. We're changing out basically all of our staff cell phones. And that's the big effect on community, on communication services, I'm sorry, price community services and then on operating supplies. We have seven replacement laptops and one desktop replacement. Moving on to item 564101, machinery and equipment. There's two additional cargo vans that's associated with the two new positions. And an addition of an 18 foot U dump trailer that is adding to the fleet of some of the equipment we need for doing these remodel projects that we have. So that's the completion of the facilities management. If you have questions, I can answer. If not, I'll move on to the health department. I think we're good. One quick question. Yep, sure. So the U dump trailers, it'll be more cost effective for us to buy one rather than lease them. So that's probably a great question for. I would say that we have. We use the trailer we have currently all the time, and it's just not large enough for what we do. And for the cost of $18,000 for how much we utilize it. I couldn't see renting something and waiting for a schedule, if that makes sense. And you beat the hell out of them, too, so you don't want a lease thing that they're going to charge you back on. So. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. So our next cost center is 181, facilities management health department on page 75. And there's no changes to the revenue increase for this budget this year. Moving on to cost center 182, courthouse security. On page 76. There's no planned increases for this service as well. Remind me, do we still have the same provider providing that service? Giddens Security corporation. Yes. Okay. They're doing a good job. They are, yeah. Okay. We go through our challenges, but they're a good team member to work with. Yeah. That completes all of my department budgets. Any questions? So will we be in the animal services facility by the end of December? Well, no, I'm gonna say by the end of November, because I want to be in there in December. So we are currently on track to have early breaking the ground early in October. And if we can make all these milestones, we have our timeline set up. We're sticking to the timeline. We've worked backwards from December 2025, and a lot of that stuff's coming clear now. We just finished schematic design moving forward to 30% construction drawings. All that has to line up. As long as we don't have long lead tight items, as long as we have things we can replace it with for equal, equal specifications, work going to be fine. And so we don't have any huge obstacles. I will tell you that the way we're going to bid this job is going to be a little more unique than what we're used to. We're having a lot of ad alternates as it relates to maybe different types of mechanical systems, the kennels in specific. So if we just design to one, one design criteria, and you bid it and it comes back too high, you don't just remove it. So we've asked to have a couple different options put in, especially on the kennels, where it would be an ad alternate, where you'd add a level of quality. And we have to decide, of the four kinnas what we're building. Can we put all that in all of them? Are we gonna have to take some away? But regardless, the envelope of that building will be designed for whatever's necessary, long term. So I think that's gonna give us the option. Once it's bid, there's no option to go back to bid or to reject the bids to get done in time. So that's how we're gonna do it. How about freedom library? Yes. So, freedom library, the information I had, which was we should be October to November breaking ground. And if you don't break ground by November, you're not going to break ground. December usually, because that's. That's a slow time for construction. So our goal, we're waiting for the invitation to bid for CPPI to go out. It's going to be 30 days. We're going to level the bids. We're going to come back to you guys for approval, and we want it. We want to do a groundbreaking immediately. And so I think there's. We can make up some ground on some of that movement and getting people in. I had. November 25 was my goal. Okay. Thank you, Jared. Yeah. Any other projects? Yeah, I was gonna say any other projects. Any other projects that are of significance? Significance. This coming year? For this coming year? Yeah, it's the large projects that we have moving on. Some of the stuff that we've presented are like a roof replacement for some of the aging infrastructure. But all the jail plumbing done? The jail plumbing is done? Yeah, all done. How are those sleeves working? So a lot of the sleeves, depending on the location, a lot of them worked out well. Some we had to go through over with epoxy. We had some challenges with it, but overall, no success. Yeah. Mister clerk, do you have anything for our facilities",

You looking at these parcels here or down here? No, up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Yeah. The subdivision to the north of it. Oh, up here? Yeah. When was, when was Oakhurst platted? 1925. Five. Oh, okay. And the roads were done when, again? Don't know the answer to that one. Okay. I was just before the eighties. You were right. Yeah. And that one up there, I think, is much older. Evergreen, I think it is, or much newer. So the roads probably aren't in as nearly as bad a shape. Okay. I was just seeing if we had any opportunities. Look at. I know there's additional mobileization cost, so that is different. But when we put these packages together, it does allow us to get some economies of scale right when we bid them out. Yes, sir. Right. Okay. Any other questions of staff right now? Okay, this is regarding Oakhurst. Is there anyone in the audience that wants to speak regarding Oakhurst? Okay, let's move it forward. Y. So, Commissioner Bryan, forward. I am o. That is not a yes on the actual project. Understood. Because of the cost. Move it forward. It is for me. See what happens. So our final proposed project. Vot. No. Then again, the cost to go. People think I want to go through engineering if you're not going to votot for it. That's what I'm saying is point. Make sure it's discussed here that when we go to engineering and design, we're looking at about $30 to $40,000. Our estimate to do that now, we estimated at 10% of the construction costs. So our estimated design cost is $50,870. Well, but we did Cedar Hills last year and we had it done. And even though we didn't, we didn't move forward with it. We can bring it back. I mean, if you guys want me to say no, I'll say no. Want to say no? This is a PCI project that the county'bringing forward? Yes, ma'am. Yeah. And nobody showed up. What's the amount of homestead? What's the. This was home 70%. We have any other pictures of the roads? They're bad. I know. I want to see them. Promise you I'm good. Moving it forward. Okay, well, now you'all. Right. So there we go. Thank you, Michelle. What she saw, she's good. Moving it forward so you don't have to worry aboutian your good question mark? Yeah. Commissionind question mark. All right. Understood. All right. Good day. I like Quee gardens. Right. So our final proposed project is Lake Wir Gardens, lake regarden replat, Bellevue os Estates, and Pinewood Estates. This community has an overall pavement condition index score of 40.035 year. Maintenance cost in this community is $70,804. It's 6.11 miles of county maintain paved roads, and within this area, there's 4487 parcels. Total estimated cost for this potential project is $3,059,591.41. With an estimated per parcel cost of $6,282.53. The proposed project area spans several platted areas. These locations are Lakeiroodd Gardens recorded in Platbook H, page 68, Lakewr Gardens Rel Platbook Z, page 76 Bellevue Oaks Estates, Platbook V, page 88 portions of Pinew Wood estates, platbook T, page four, and certain benefiting out parcels recorded in platbook unrecorded 85. This area is located in Commissioner District three. These parcels that would be affected by the proposed project in this area are highlighted in green on the map. Lakewood Gardens was originally planted in 1967, Lake R Garden replat in 1988, Bellevue Oaks Estates in 1983, and Pinewood Estates in 1989. So approximately 60% of these properties are homesteaded, with the average property value standing at $114,200. So this breakdown is an estimated cost for a ten year assessment for this project. The construction costs our $2,208,114.56. Does bring our loaded cost to $3,000,059 591, $0.41. Our estimated per parcel assessment cost is $6,282.53. And that brings us to an estimated annual assessment of $814.41. Again, this is estimated at a 5% interest rate and the costs are broken down at the bottom of this slide. And this breakdown illustrates the estimated cost for a 15 year assessment. So, as you can see, the only number that changed is the estimated annual assessment, which adjusts from the $814.41 to the $605.97, again estimated at 5% interest rate. We did hold a community meeting on Wednesday, May 17, 2023, and the number in attendance was nine. We did receive three pieces of written communication, and those are the pieces of communication the board does have in front of them. Matt. Commissioner Bryant, you may be able to answer this, but with roses in such bad condition, once they're assuming they're repaired, can you estimate what the value that is to a resale of a home? It's. Is there a percentage that I couldn't. That would be tricky for me to be able to do that. I couldn't answer that question, sir. You ever dealt with that? I don't have a percentage, but I mean, it definitely is a plus. You know, when you have new roads. ##ay I don't know if it changes the value as much as it changes, like, people even willing to buy it at all. Right. I. That's what happens most of the time, right? You drive on the road and you go to the back where the house is for sale, and you get on that road, it looks like. I mean, these roads are really bad. I mean, there's a twelve in here, so you might as well call it a dirt road. A dirt. There's no pavement leftir, so. Okay, anyone in the audience that wants to speak to the lake, we gardens this project. Lake where? Gardens we bellevue Oaks, pinew wood. Bunch of people here. Nobody wants to talk node. Okay. We don't know what you're thinking if you don't come up and tell us. There we go. Oh, you gotta take her. All right. Thanks for coming in. You're welcome. My name is Joy Forbes. I'm actually here for a friend of mine. I don't live in lakeware Gardens, but he just bought a house over there, so you have to give your address for the record. My address where I live. Okay. That's what I was going to ask. My address is 4385 southeast 61st street in Ocala. 34480. And I would just say that I would be for it. My niece has lived over there for a lot of years and I know the roads are terrible. I'm also a realtor. And though, while you can't give a value, it does what Carl was saying add to desirability, which adds to value. So that's it for me. Yeahkay. Thank you. Certainly. When you look at the pictures that Matt's given us, plus the ones we've gotten in our package here. I mean, and the constitue. I don't get any tuckers. So you want to try again? Anybody else live in lake be gardens and want to come and tell us your thoughts? All right, don't worry about it. I'll move it forward. We don't move it forward. Yeah, whatever. I'm moving itus, you know what I mean? Look at you making a mistake. Yeah, look at that. I make plenty of mistakes. Just ask my wife, Michelle. Consensus. She's good if she doesn't say anything, remember? Well, you did last. I am. The only thing I would ask, mister chair, is if Matt Mike could address it. Seems like one of the concerns was speeding on some of the roadways. And I know it's probably maybe a 25 miles an hour subdision. Hope not. I don't know. Should be at least 30, 30, not 35. Yes, Commissioner Stone, I can reach out to the sheriff's office to try to help address the speeding, and I can work with the office of the county engineer just to confirm those speed limit signs as well. And I appreciate the sentiments of the lady that give those. But that's basically, you know, putting a speed table in there, like through the whole thing if we don't repair them. So I just would like to. If we could help address that issue on behalf of safety over there, I just would appreciate it. So thanks, Matt. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All right, so the consensus is to take it to the next level. When will we expect these projects back, Matt? These? I can give you a timeline. I don't have that answer now just based on the workload of the engineers, but I can give you the board, a timeline, a rough estimate of that. I don't have that now, though, so I apologize. Update us at our next board meeting. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Absolutely. We'll get a timeline on that. All rightse that's it. I rest. Thank you, sir. Okay. All",

        "text": " the great state of Alabama. I am highly in favor of the Alabama. Well, your real accent really comes out when you say Alabama. Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute. So having welcome and let me introduce you to commissioners O'Brien. Good morning. So also having lineage that comes from the great state of Alabama. There we go. And we were having a discussion yesterday. Do you eat cream of wheat? No, ma'am. Absolutely not. I eat cream of wheat and I don't understand where that. I love grits, too. So anyway, welcome to the team. Thank you. You didn't ask him about grits. Oh, he. I'm sure he eats grits. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Not instant. Not instant grants. No, no, no, no. We welcome you. And would you like to address the board for a few moments? Absolutely. Honorable commissioners, county administrator. Assistant county administrator. First, I'd like to thank you for considering my application. This has been a goal of mine for some time. And just give you a brief background about myself. So you probably cannot tell from the accent, but I am actually german, so I come from a military background, family wise. My dad was in the army, mother from Germany. That was my first language. We moved back stateside. Was raised in Alabama. So after my father retired, I did have the opportunity to work with him. He owned his own construction business. So I had quite a bit of experience around heavy equipment growing up. As I moved off to college, I did go to Auburn University, graduated from Auburn University with a bachelor's in civil engineering. And that is where I met my wife, Bridget. She's here with me today to support me as well. And shortly after graduating, I started my civil engineering career with Volkert, and I did quite a bit of construction engineering and inspection for five and a half years. I had the opportunity to be a part of some very large road and bridge projects, one of which was a complete reconstruction of bridges in downtown Birmingham. So through those experiences, I've gained a lot of construction related experience. I've got a lot of familiarity with what needs to occur in the field to have a successful project. My wife and I decided before we had kids, we wanted to get a little bit closer to the beach, and we moved to the farthest location in Florida that you can get to the beach, Marion county. So after making that move, I've been with Sumter county for a little over five years, and it's been an absolute honor working under our public works director, Deborah Snyder. During my time there, she's a professional traffic operations engineer. Took me under her wing. She's taught me a significant amount about traffic engineering and overall road projects. I'm very familiar with federal grants, state grants, so I hope to bring all of those experiences to Marion county and really look forward to serving the community and the board as a whole. Thank you Mister Cohen. Any additional comments, questions? Welcome to the team. Yeah, welcome to the best job you'll ever have. Thank you so much. Welcome. And Bridget, thank you for being with us today as well. We will treat him well. Thank you. I thought your last supervisor was good. Wait till you meet Tracy Straub. For real? Yes, sir. I've heard great things. I've heard great things about the entire team. So thank you. Thank you, Stephen. Thank you. One more thing that is not an agenda I would like to discuss with the board. If you recall, few meetings ago, we discussed the Ag lot split and we had an issue for a waiver that the applicant was asking for more than ten lots. And the board at that time, I think, directed us to accept, to process all the applications we have in the queue and don't accept any more applications until the LDC language has been revised and clarified. We still have applicants coming in, they want to submit and they want to use this process. And they are meeting all the LDC requirements. And staff understand this is the guideline that we follow and we cannot deviate from the existing LDC guidelines and those people qualify to apply and to use that process. And as long as they meet those requirements and we don't grant any additional waivers, the only waiver they may be asking for, which has to be granted by the board, is if they do not want to do an MSPU. Can I have some concurrence from you to be able to accept those type of applications who do meet the requirements of the LDC without any waivers? So we don't delay any of those applicants and any of those property owners. Mister Minter is still working and looking at that, with staff looking at the LDC language to clarify it and modify it, but I don't know how long it's going to take. Mister Minter, do you have anything to add to that? Yeah. So one of the main concerns I had with that whole process was the state plating statute and the state chapter 177. The state plating statute says it provides the minimum requirements for the creation of maps that people are going to use to sell property in relation to a lot number within that plat. And so it concerned me that our ag lot split section in our code really was a deviation from the minimum requirements in the Platt statute. However, we don't have any regulation in Marion county that would deny someone the ability to obtain a building permit unless they subdivide land according to the statute. So to boil that down, my opinion is that we can still legally do these aglat splits under our code in Marion county since we don't have that requirement. Some local governments have that requirement that you have to, if you want to sell property or build property, you have to plat according to the platform statute. In the state of Florida, anybody who wants to sell property can sell property by meets and boughs description. I think we talked about this before. If you wanted to sell a 1 sqft piece of your property, you can legally do that by a meats and bows description. You may not be able to comply with the zoning regulations and everything else, but. So, given some of the people that have come in, we had one individual came in that said that it was represented by staff before they bought the property, that they were going to be able to get an Agla split. So I met with their attorney and them, and they were just doing the more basic Agla split, and I felt like that was appropriate for that to move forward. So I concur with what Mister Vienna says. I think there's a, some refinements we need to make to the code that we have right now. But as long as nobody is asking for additional waivers from the LDC except for the MSBU, I'm comfortable with people being able to continue on with Aglat splits for the time being. Okay, I'll bring it to the board for conversation. Yes, sir, I'm okay with that. But how long just to get the big stuff that we talked about? That was the issue, at least getting those things fixed, I'd say they were going to be. Well, I thought so too. And then we got a lot of stuff on your plate, so. Yeah, right. So having at least I satisfied myself regarding that Platt statute issue, I think as far as the specific amendments, we can bring those back to you by the beginning of February, probably. And I would say one of the issues that's going to be a policy issue for you is right now in the code on Eglot splits, there's no maximum number. I think when the board created that regulation way back when, there was some expectation that somebody might come in for one time for an AGla split of, but not that you could get an eglide split from this parcel, and then from that one you get another one, and from that one you get another one. So that will be part of the discussion, policy discussion to bring back to you. So does that matter to. I know one of the questions that I got posed was, I think the one you're talking about is a parent track. Right. And then subsequent tracks. But also I think there may need to be a policy about adjacent tracks, even because you have people that buy it and then put it in different llcs to get significant more density right next to each other, it has to be minimum ten acre lots. You know what you end up with. But still, how many of those do you want? Good question. So today, do we want to go back to allowing ag lots splits as long as they meet the requirements in the LD? See, with the exception of if they want a variance, a waiver for the MSBU that will have to come back before the board. That's correct. And I would like to provide clear direction. We have to do that. I mean, if it follows our code and it's there, I don't. I think we're obliged to have to take that. But I do want to see the code changed as we all talked about where we got into this with that one case originally was the DRC was granting waivers beyond the MSVU waiver. That's correct. And so I'm not recommending that DRC be able to do that. Correct. They now understand and they won't. Thank you. That's all what I have. Okay, thank you. It also looks like we have a walk on item that's coming up at the next under notation for action, we will bring that item. Okay, very good. I'm just looking committee items that's going to take us back to our clerk. Mister Clerk, hopefully you've had a chance to look at all those votes. Thank you, madam chair",

17th 2023 meeting minutes Madam chair yes if I may so the two options for the motion are as presented and recommended by staff and the second would be with changes um so we didn't realize it until just recently that the meeting minutes do not accurately reflect the October vote um in that vote council member Condon abstained from voting on the October meeting minutes and so the November meeting minutes didn't accurately reflect that so that would be uh my recommendation in terms of the motion is as presented and recommended U by staff with the change to reflect that council member Condon did not vote on the October minutes okay Madam chair yes hi I move that the council approve the minutes of the November 17th 2023 meeting um as presented and recommended by staff with the one change that uh councelor Condon uh abstained from the vote on the October October uh meeting minutes approval thank you Vice chair how has made a motion Cindy Conan for the records I second that motion thank you council member Condon any other comments hearing none Mr secretary please call the role Kent how yes and byon I'll abstain because I was not at the November meeting thank you and we'll make sure to reflect that in these minutes thank you Jordan trit yes per chak to yes yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary our next item is the Council secretary report thank you madam chair um so Staffing and Council updates I'll start with um so Governor kotek has appointed Katie Imes of Lexington to replace council member Truitt so for those of you who are not familiar with Lexington it is approximately 37 miles directly south of bardman so miss IMS would give us uh I think very important geographic representation um we historically uh or at least for quite some time had representation in that area in that sort of uh Columbia Plateau area um the majority of our facilities have been there uh for quite some time so having Miss Imes should she get through the Senate rules committee and the full Senate vote would be an important geographic representation um that we haven't had for for some period of time um Miss Imes currently serves as a council member on the for the town of Lexington so she's a city council member and previously she was the moral County Transit manager so she lives in a good area and she um has a lot of interest in terms of these facilities the Senate rules committee will meet early February to review and recommend appointees and the full Senate should vote shortly after that um do not have the exact dates yet if Miss Imes is confirmed she would participate in the February council meeting and therefore this could be Council member TR its's final meeting to to be determined um but it could be so if that is the case I just want to take the opportunity to say that it's been a pleasure to work with you and to provide whatever assistance we we can to you in your um hard work and efforts and my sincerest gratitude on all of your hard work and and thoughtful deliberations on you know what are some very complicated projects well thank you Todd and for the record this is uh Jordan TR I I spent a wild four years uh it's been a very interesting time I don't know that I was aware this might potentially be my last meeting but um in the event that it is thank you to everyone for staff um and the support of fellow council members and the public um it's been very informative and educational and I will definitely keep close tabs on what's going on so thank you Todd so it's always a little awkward because the timing of the U replace ments so if it is we will invite you back and have a proper thank you at a future time and if if it if this is not my last meeting then I'll do this again I just this is coun or chair girl I just want to say that one thank you for sticking around when you didn't have to to make sure that we could continue conducting uh business and I definitely will uh take you up on that followup because you know we still haven't played golf yet so let's go uh next I would like to introduce uh om Carr um she is our new operations and policy analyst and replaces Wally Adams omit started on December 4th she comes to us from the private sector and most recently was an operations project manager for remotely video where she did extensive um project management and business process Improvement um so she's got a lot of experience in there which is primarily what the position is designed for so she is still very much coming up to speed on working for the state of Oregon as well as working in sort of the Nuance of of what we do um but she's making very significant progress and um will likely be on the agenda for next month to have her um her annual work uh program uh reviewed and approved by the council in terms of what the process of improvement projects um she'll be working on in the near term so um so we have an interesting Tradition at the sighting division I'm not sure we've ever told you about this but when um it's somebody's birthday during our staff meetings we kazoo them happy birthday um and that's usually really poorly done but um but it's fun nonetheless so um on Tuesday uh Dwayne was not at our um staff meeting because he normally doesn't work on Friday so he switched his days to be able to be here today for the agenda item so we did not kazoo happy birthday to Dwayne tomorrow is his birthday uh I'm not going to do it today but I just want to express since we missed it happy birthday happy birthday uh next are project updates um so the first is on the Muddy Creek energy Park um as a reminder of the project is currently proposed as a 199 megawatt solar PV and battery storage facility located immediately east of Interstate 5 and approximately 8 miles south of the city of Brownsville the project would occupy 1,588 Acres or 2.5 square miles the project is currently in the notice of intent phase uh and the applicant has not yet submitted their application to us although we do believe that will will be coming very shortly um so more importantly for the purpose of this update is there is no current open public comment period so last week um both council members Truitt and council member uh Condon received emails from members of the public and people just sort of searched you all out um and tried to find your emails um and you both received emails expressing opposition to the project um council member it and council member Conan promptly sent those emails to me um asking what you should do with them um and so essentially where we're at now because it's no there's no open public comment time frame um this creates a potential issue with the record council members are obligated to only rely upon information in the record with which to evaluate and issue a decision so information that you receive outside of those time frames um must be disclosed on the record so that's what we're doing today um you Nancy printed the two emails um that the two council members received you all have those um Chase mcfay Walker who's the Project Lead has provided those to the applicant and we put them in the record of the project um so this is one thing that's important to make sure that it's all disclosed so that any final decision by the council um is an appropriate decision and it's based only on information on the record so now this information is on the record um so my recommendation to you should you receive emails in the future is to do exactly that do not respond um you know forward them to us if somebody engages you in a you know verbal conversation or calls you on the phone um my recommendation is to politely cut that off um and you know should you receive re any kind of substantive information from them it would need to be disclosed on the record um such as we're doing today um and forwarded to the applicant to make sure that they have an opportunity to respond to any information um as well um what we've done with the two emails that we received or",

overall package that has been presented by a congress two different packages actually the infrastructure investment and jobs Act of 2021 and the inflation reduction Act of 2022. together these represent many many different Federal programs that impact energy climate and other areas of infrastructure and health care um under this it provides an opportunity known as the greenhouse gas reduction fund under the inflation reduction act next slide please so um and in that solar for all is one of the parts of the greenhouse gas reduction fund which brings us here so it's one of three competitions under the greenhouse gas reduction fund and I will note that out of those three competitions it's also the only one that states are eligible to apply for directly under solar for all the U.S EPA anticipates providing 7 billion in funding Across the Nation the grant funds are to be used to transform the solar Market by enabling access for low-income households and residents of disadvantaged communities exclusively and that's a key element that we'll be thinking about as we are preparing our application and a an aspect we'd love to hear more from all of you about what we can think about in order to be successful as we go about trying to achieve that that mission next slide please as part of these recent Federal Investments the solar for all competition is a covered program under the Biden Harris administration's justice 40 initiative the justice 40 initiative is seeking to invest federal funds so that 40 of the benefits of these funds serve disadvantaged communities this complements the administration's comprehensive approach to to advance equity in line with executive order 13 985. there's also broader considerations for Community benefits specifically seeking to integrate benefits for labor and Workforce at a community level as part of a community benefits plan in in this application process next slide please so you might be wondering um what exactly is a disadvantaged community and under this competition the primary tool um is this climate and economic Justice screening tool that has been provided by the White House the areas shaded in Gray on the map are the census tracts identified as disadvantaged communities by this tool some of the darker gray areas indicate where tribal lands are located as well while in this tool it provides census tract information and classification as to whether or not a community meets the need the definition of disadvantage you can see in the box that the level of detail you can observe from the tool varies quite a bit if you zoom in and we have a sample where you can see the details of Medford Oregon in this particular example to see it really can get down to a neighborhood level next slide please the U.S EPA is issuing three types of applications Options under the solar for all competition and it's primarily based on Geographic coverage one option is based on a specific state or territory another option is based on tribal governments and communities and the third option is based on a regional approach next slide please and so the option that we are here today about is actually option number one um we are specifically working on an application for the geographic coverage within the state of Oregon next slide please so let's cover some of the key deadlines just to get started as a precursor to an application a notice of intent was required and Oregon did submit our notice of intent on July 28 2023 and we are tentatively estimating a hundred million dollar application which small falls into the small award category however as we continue to refine our application and our plans and further project the number of households will be able to collectively serve we may revisit that amount if we believe we have strategies that can benefit more than ten thousand households which is the recommended guidelines from the EPA for exceeding The Small Small Program award category and the next key deadline is that the application is due to the U.S EPA on September 26th and following that we will need to wait to see if we are selected for an award this is a competitive Grant application and so that will take some time for EPA to run that process but the U.S EPA does anticipate that grantees will be selected approximately in July of 2024 and then if we are fortunate to be selected then there would be a five-year period of performance and we would have an option um use the first year for for planning purposes out of those five years next slide please so you may be wondering what some of the outcomes of this award might be what what might the impact of this look like well the U.S EPA has directed us to provide information on the outcomes and benefits we anticipate our proposal could accomplish if awarded these include impacts such as the number of total households projected to benefit from the program um the amount of funding per household the megawatts of solar capacity deployed the tons of CO2 avoided and household savings as well as average funding per household savings um in addition to that there are requests for Meaningful benefit plans so one of those examples is that setting a minimum that 20 a household Energy savings is of the average household utility bill in the utilitar utility uh territory is achieved through deployment of these funds so basically we're looking to help save energy through Solar Technologies particularly with low-income households and disadvantaged we're also looking to increase low income and disadvantaged households access to solar deployment options deliver on energy resilience and grid benefits by creating capacity that can deliver electricity to low-income and disadvantaged communities in the event of a grid outage and maximizing household and Community ownership models in Solar Technologies next slide please so in order to achieve those impacts and outcomes we'll have to take on certain the application from the US EPA breaks those down into a distributed solar Market strategy a financial assistance strategy which they would like to see 75 percent of the funds to be used for financial assistance for these projects and then a project deployment technical assistance strategy and an equitable access and meaningful involvement plan all of these applications right now are early stage Concepts which we'd love to discuss with you all today and with that I'll hand this over to Rob Del Mar to start to introduce our early stage thank you Jen and just an audio check is it coming through okay there we go okay so for Oregon's concept to spend these funds we've got some um some broad goals that I'll describe momentarily and then we also have some more programs specific ideas um that I'll cover in future slides so from the big picture we really want to utilize these federal",

        "text": " we don't have an application right now the way that i'm handling it just in terms of a public servant's role of answering questions providing process when we receive a request to pass along comments to the council i will send that to secretary cornett and he'll make sure that we're able to package it so that we're not overwhelming counsel with but at this time in terms of any issues raised by the public because we don't have a application to review yet it's more informative for us and then an opportunity for us to share information about process and then that differs from nolan hills where there have been a few comments that have come in um so i'll move back to that one and um you know i i would have to say in contrast we haven't received as many comments now that doesn't minimize the impact of the comments on nolan hills but i would say comments have been most interested or most concerned about the transmission line routes and so as we were going through reviewing the application and developing a request for additional information the applicant elected to add an additional sub route to the bp stanfield route based on some of those comments coming into us and that was based on some concerns about the initial route they had selected and so they have one that is very close but you know just on the other side of an important boundary line okay thank you and sorry i had uh bonanza at the top of my mind it was um that i was thinking of but both of them i appreciate the comments about both of that's a great question and um and you know we've also been getting comments on eugene medford as which is the next one i'll talk about and so as part of that um you know i i tend to still be in the role of answering questions a lot of what i emphasize to folks is that if we're not in an active public comment all those comments are considered i certainly save them but if people are really interested in participating you know in the later stages of the something really important to emphasize is that they need to participate at the draft proposed order stage and so any comments i get i try and let people know that they'll want to continue to participate if they're concerned about the project great thank you so madam chair this is hanley hey hanley katie you do have a preliminary application for nolan hills correct that's correct councilman jenkins but you just haven't determined that it's complete yet according to the slide here that's correct yes and so in our process as you know we don't um have an obligation to begin drafting the draft proposed order until an application is found complete but where we have any capacity we certainly try to for those particular exhibits where we do have sufficient yeah so there there is some information available for the public um in the preliminary application um on this on nolan hills that's correct and that's posted on the okay thank you right and um to be clear there for nolan hills for bonanza for any project that's going through the standard review process for a new there will be a meeting or you know it's at the department's discretion but there can be a meeting at the completeness determination phase where the department finds an application for site certificate then the public's made aware of that and then that occurs before we release the draft proposed order so that's an opportunity to talk with folks about next steps in the process what's in the application and how they can participate once the draft proposed order is okay well i will move on to the next project update and feel free to let me know if you have additional questions the next update is request for amendment 4 to the eugene to medford transmission line site certificate pacificor's eugene medford transmission line is an operating 500 kilovolt transmission line that runs 146 miles from pacificor's spencer switching station which is south of eugene to pacific core's meridian substation near medford the council first issued a site certificate for the facility in 1982 so this is one of your older facilities pacificorp seeks approval to expand the site boundary and develop additional transmission infrastructure in josephine and jackson counties including through a small segment of the city of rogue river so i have two figures to show next to help give a sense of where all these features would the overview figure here shows a portion of the existing eugene and medford transmission line in blue and then the requests for amendment four components are shown in red here there's a yellow triangle at the intersection of these two features the blue line and the red line so the existing transmission infrastructure and the proposed new transmission infrastructure and that yellow triangle near sam's valley is known as the proposed sams valley substation which would connect the new and existing infrastructure this slide shows only the request for amendment 4 component so zoomed in a bit as part of request for amendment 4 pacific corps would replace 17.6 miles of existing 115 kv transmission line between grants pass and josephine county and sam's valley in jackson county and they would replace that with a new double circuit line which would have 230 kilovolts on one side and 115 kilovolts on the other in addition they would reconductor 4.9 miles of an existing 230 kv transmission line between sam's valley and the proposed new sams valley substation and the whetstone substation which already exists and that's near white a new 500 and 230 kilovolt substation the one i referred to before sam's valley substation would be developed on approximately 17 acres just south of highway 234 and just north of lower table rock existing access roads would be temporarily improved to construct these proposed new facilities collectively these components are known as the sams valley reinforcement project so you'll hear us refer to emt amd4 you know as our shorthand or to sams valley the sams valley reinforcement project is intended to address deficiencies in the regional transmission system to reduce the risk of power outages in jackson and josephine counties at this time we're awaiting additional about mitigation for impacts to cultural resources before we find the request for amendment complete and release the draft proposed order now for this one because we have the information we need but for you know one standard i'll be a really important we've been able to draft a lot of parts of the draft proposed order but you know we still need that additional information before we can move forward with finding a request complete at this point i'd be happy to answer any questions you may have yeah madam chair this is hanley are they um are they expanding the right-of-way for this replacement between grants pass and sam's valley that's correct yes um thank you for that and and so councilmember jenkins and so they would need to expand the right-of-way because the 115 kilovolt transmission line has required clearances but then if you move up in voltage by adding the 230 kv circuit they need to expand out and so the total right-of-way would end up being about feet and for most of the line that would moving out an additional 35 feet it really depends on the land ownership type but it would definitely involve an okay thank you so that's that's why they're having to do the cultural resources evaluation is because they're expanding the right of yes and um the even the other elements the reconductor portion of the line for example running between the proposed names valley substation and whetstone there's some sensitivity there um the bigger or another area may have a high potential for cultural resources that we're not aware of and cultural resource that we're very well aware of a traditional cultural property and that's lower table rocks and so that would be impacted by the sams valley substation and so based on the various features in particular the substation there's additional work going on at the federal review level for section 106 and that was triggered because the bureau of land management would have to authorize the transmission line which goes through their land and then under the national environmental policy act the substation even though that's on private land pacifico owns that land it's treated as a connected action and so all of that has gotten wrapped into government to government in section 106 of the national historic preservation act and rather than duplicating that process we've been waiting to see the outcome of the section 106 negotiations to reach a memorandum of agreement and so that would impact or that involves the confederate tribes of the grand ronde the cow creek tribe and the tribe and of course blm pacific core and shippo are involved in that wow okay thank you unless there are any other questions i will turn the presentation over to our operations and policy analyst wally thanks katie thank you katie can you pass me a presenter rights maximizing the screen again to do that and i confess the um i just have the tiny webex screen it doesn't want to maximize for me maybe uh maybe danita can help us out there we go there we go and wally you have the ball all right hopefully everybody can see my screen yes we can see it thanks quality great uh so hello members of the council chair grail for the record my name is wally adams i'm an operations and policy analyst with the oregon department of so i'm going to talk today about the port westward renewable diesel project this is actually a request for an exemption from the requirement to get a site it's for renewable diesel production facility it would be capable of processing up to 50 000 barrels per day of renewable biomass speed stacks in case you're curious what that means is basically vegetable oils and animal fats is what they've said that they would use as the feedstock for this facility it would be located at port westward industrial park in scanning in columbia the applicant is next renewable fuels and the status is that we've determined the request to be incomplete at this time it's basically it's waiting on local land use approval so there are five criteria that have to be met in statute in order to qualify for the exemption from the requirement for site certificate and and one of those is that the facility has received local land use approval under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local and that the facility complies with any statewide planning goals or rules of the land conservation and development commission that are",

Global is walking to the door commissioner Griggs your commissioner commissioner Levin commissioner Slater commissioner Viera brandell is not here yet and commissioner gopal thank you we have one Accord thank you moving to public comment for item three this is the time for anybody to put comment if you like other than public hearings deliberations and mirrors of land musicians are renewable bias so I'm not seeing anybody jumping out to put into y'all are good uh moving on to the consent calendar item 4.1 since we're missing commissioner Vera Brando commissioner then would you please make that much I can certainly do that I will make a motion that we approved the draft thank you second from Heller discussion on the motion I will be abstain thank you any other comments shelving would you please call the role signify by saying I'm your favorite permission maybe you are a host commissioner egus I was not it was absent uh however it appears that if all the people are arrested didn't vote with me I have there was four people absent from the last meeting and then with Randell yeah I'm trying to figure out if my vote his name uh versus motion you don't need Forum on the boat so it just needs some fun commissioner bot I'm saying commissioner Goble commissioner Griggs aye commissioner Heller aye commissioner Levin I'm Steve commissioner Slater is obscening and commissioner Vera Brandel is absent and so is commissioner Augustine so we don't have the majority um it is the app for abstaining and free 4.2 is the code Amendment resolution number 23-02 Austin do you want to give us a brief summary or do you want to just um so this code amendment is uh the result of some changes to State rule making so the climate-friendly and Equitable Community School making has certain requirements to be this code amendment applies to large parking lots for those who were half an acre in size that would propose some mitigation climate mitigation actions either additional tree candidate coverage or solar power on site um and then it would also expand the opportunities for public bodies to convert existing parking lots to parking rides and we've made some changes to allow a single group occupancy housing more broadly in Salem which is part of a different uh legislative I guess process from the same right also required and then Lisa reminded me that it will come before in a public hearing either September october-ish that's correct we're looking at September 19th so um questions of Commissioners commissioner Snyder followed by commissioner egos thank you do we have the opportunity to be more restrictive in this code the state has thank you let me show you guys um I'm just trying to clarify where things are what I have or what I've received is just an initiation is is there an actual draft something that I do not have that it should end so uh staff report and the actual code amendments themselves will go out with the uh any commission notice for the September 19th meeting but this time those codependents aren't available then okay just to make sure it was yeah I'm not sure it's more of a comment I think it follows them I hope that particularly pain slightly tree canopy and parking lots that we will be fairly and the other my question is so between now and when the code amendment is open Planning position what opportunities are there for us to be more active in the drafting of that or is it just going to be a straight like one-to-one text of what the state requires and then my follow-up question for that would be like in what ways is the city going to engage with public and developers and like um um organizations in getting their input on the um like implementation of these thank you there's three questions okay first um admissions opportunity to influence code and then we'll be through the public hearing process so we will draft what we've been influence the state rule or any other ways in the code and then in the hearing the page recommendations motions if you want to change it you don't have to decide that night we do we have to have the rules adopted by them this year and it has to go to council um but it's can talk about what kind of Outreach would be planned so we're planning to obviously for the public hearing process here from anyone who has an input um I think because these are State mandated changes um unless there was a big Thrive to go well beyond the safe requirements um the biggest theme of the public Outreach would be to help our regular applicants understand the implications of these changes so that they understand what they'll need to do in the future because these are some um pretty big changes that we don't currently necessarily have the mechanisms to renew right now and so it'll take some some changes and some growth on the part of developers to make sure that they're complying so we'll definitely do Outreach at that stage do you have any other questions um I do need a promotion on this because it would be happy to make a motion that we recommend staff formalize a climate friends and high Global communities of being a part of the requirements for code adoptions at city council are you all right we'll actually come outside last forward Slaters our second discussion on the motion it's gonna be a very interesting this is exciting I'm looking forward to it okay commissioner I'm going to approach this from another so in the political sphere you were awesome earlier before we started we were talking about legislature and political climate and how things move I know that sometimes other agenda items are tied to a bill that's moved through the legislature and wondering if this would be an opportunity in time because the short timeline on this that staff might take some of those items that were recommended to be uses and occupancies that were recommended to be included into the office Zone and maybe piggyback that on if there's there's already code amendments happening that may be making with a small adjustment to the office Zone code um would be financially beneficial to the city to do as a part of this and I would recommend that we kind of tie that project with this something that I would the reason I make that comment is that especially what we're seeing in the business climate as far as the change in office occupancy um I've always been pretty vocal and candid about my displeasure about the lack of uses and occupancies that are allowed in the office so in the City of Salem and as we're seeing Major Market shift it's even more important to expand that list now so that we don't have gobs and dogs taken off this space all over Salem simply because that list of what's allowed in there so restricted so can you give me an example of what you would see as those positive adjustment of autism uh allowing uh cafe or retail um in the office Zone currently is a very very Chinese footprint that you could have a cafe it is based on floor space and then it's a limitation of how much of that floor and then that Cafe is known themselves it is it's whittled down so much that yeah there's very few opportunities where you can put a cafe in an office building where that's actually a large one typically something that passed the example was post-secondary education was not allowed but counseling and made in the union halls rolled out so a couple of years ago I argued a challenge city council do and then secondary education it was so that a dance school would go into a building that wasn't technically someone's office which actually makes a lot of sense um where the other uses so if we look at the summer code there's a survival uses that would apply and it sounds weird to be tied with something like this but as and that's why I make the reference to the legislature it's a lot of times bills have stuff added on YouTube because they they're needed based on the timeliness of what's Happening as we've heard over the years from staff we can't we can't just afford the labor to go make code adjustments whenever we'll be able to move along because it's such a new match so if we're going to do this now could we take some stuff off the bucket list and tie it to this so that their the code is amended in several places um we are already making a couple adjustments to the commercial office in terms of the park and rise and single room occupancy so um that section of code I guess is open um I think it would require protection get it incorporated into the current proposed amendment but um that's definitely something that I think we could at least discuss very quick vertical piece of expertise yeah I don't think we've done a conference and look at all the uses of the CEO um if you want to contact staff with some specific uses you want to look at you can try to do that real quick I don't know if I can commit that we can look at like every listen to comments it's just a lot of work to hopefully a lot of people on vacation series um but I I know I remember what you're talking about with the schools and we need that change you know the CEOs don't use this on the bucket list so I know I'm talking about the office uses you know the economy and not turning it into a retail settings yeah I just think that it'd be very easy for myself to put together a list of sincerity um obviously consequencies that wouldn't be challenging difficult for the staff to be able to improve quickly review and identify that that is identical or similar to other listing uses okay I'm sympathetic to the issue of an office at an office space and but I think what commissioner was talking about was trying to piggyback that onto this week these words and if that's the case I I really don't think that's a good idea I mean I understand the idea of trying to make it efficient but um you know I've had some experience in the legislation because a long time ago um you know generally when you add stuff it has to be it's in the same route similar uh topic um and my my concern would be that this has a particular Focus this is a state's climate friendly and Equitable communities and it's a focused on climate change and the environment I mean maybe we're talking about cooling centers or something in office spaces you can see it fit um my concern is that if you try and combine them that you lose that focus on this particular movie and you may actually kind of lose the focus on both of them um because they're they are just two",

important and we stressed that alignment uh in our application and I'm convinced that that that was helpful in us being successful in that endeavor so my hope in this this effort is to get the tribes um integrated as a course of business in energy policy development and then also um at the front end um such that you know their their um proposals and processes and concerns are considered um early on because they can be quite informative to the process to help it uh in the long run to avoid some obstacles so great to be here thank you thank you and welcome so next up is Scott good morning everybody Cory out with Pacific Power uh as some of you know Pacific Power serves a lot of communities about 243 communities across Oregon Washington Northern California so couple hundred communities in Oregon in kind of a patchwork setting from Northeast part of the State uh with significant portions of service in southern Oregon along the coast other rural parts of the state I'm in customer and Community Solutions and so I spent while I've been at the company number of years probably getting close to 20 years now I spent last number of years anyway in customer programming Energy Efficiency demand response voluntary Renewables Transportation electrification programs so that's often the lens I view a lot of opportunities and energy planning work with and and certainly something I hope to bring to this group as well and I guess to conclude i' maybe follow up to a comment Erin started with around making this an accessible and understandable plan over time I thought that was really thoughtful and I'd maybe add the idea of of flexibility and tied to sound technical analysis into that mix because I it's kind of how I think of what we hope the outcome should be thank you thank you and welcome so next up is Ellsworth Lane are you here Ellsworth don't think I saw Gilly no okay how about Emily Griffith hi everyone I'm Emily Griffith I'm with renewable Northwest we're a renewable energy advocacy nonprofit based here in Oregon and I'm our Oregon policy manager um we worked on Hospital 3630 in 2023 because um we we have our clean energy mandate but we really saw a need for Oregon to have a plan and a comprehensive strategy for how we'll reach our clean energy mandate so um really happy to be here and uh happy that we've been welcomed back and um hoping to just help inform um energy strategy we work in the regulatory space policy space and and markets and transmission space so um I'm just just yeah hoping to help bring some of the expertise from the renewable Northwest folks to this to this strategy so thanks thank you and welcome next up Childs good morning everyone um Aon Childs executive director with RHA very pleased to be joining folks this morning um RHA the renewal hydrogen Alliance is focused on accelerating a transition to renewable hydrogen across the Pacific Northwest and so from our perspective we're very interested to engage with this group to get a clear understanding on how renewable hydrogen will be able to support the States's energy environment and economic goals we're seeing a lot of interest in hydrogen across Transportation industrial sectors and energy resilience and this kind of integrated process is really helpful for us to get an overall view on how we'll be supplying that hydrogen how we be transporting it and some of the end uses we're expecting to see be most common so very excited to be working with folks and uh learning through this process thank you glad to have you with us next up Fred is it hute hot help me is Fred here morning everybody uh thanks uh it's Fred huitt Northwest Energy coish uh senior policy associate our alternate uh for this group will be Alma Pinto our environmental justice policy associate who's also here in the Portland area uh great to be here uh the Northwest Energy Coalition is about a 100 organizations primarily an Coalition uh in the four Northwest states we also have some members in British Columbia uh we have environmental Civic Human Service organizations utilities and businesses uh plus we also have individual membership I have quite a lot of those uh we had we're our mission is to advance clean Equitable and affordable energy policies I've been involved in the Oregon policy energy policy world for quite a while in fact involved in the early legislation that uh had Odo doing the state energy plan that has now been replaced by the banal uh Energy report and this process the energy strategy so I'm really thrilled about that it's a big step up uh in the Direction Where We need to be I'm very glad to be here and thanks thank you and welcome glad to have you with us next up Ivy quatch good morning everyone I don't know if you guys could see me here I had some issues before on getting on board as a panelist here but I'm really um honored to be on this team with everybody here with all the experiences that you guys have um just a little bit about myself here um I'm currently the CFO in operations here for QB fabrication and buing we um specialize in manufacturing transmission towers and substations and distributions all over the Northwest from Canada to the city of San Francisco even we work a lot of of J contractors and the counties as well we've worked with PGE as well and Pacific Corp and primarily we are the preferred vendor for bonaval power Administration and we've been in business for over 37 years um so I'm very excited to be part of this team I have um a lot of wealth of knowledge too of how Transmissions kind of work at it what are the issues are coming up what type of programs and projects are coming out with that just because we deal with a lot of contractors that are currently in the plays with this and primarily big one as you know is BPA um so I'm looking to provide some inputs as well and looking to hear from everybody else I'm learning so simply this is this is such a great thing to hear from um all the groups here thank you great to have you with us thank you so much so next up is Jeff hammerland Jeff hammerland pronounced correctly thank you de I am indeed Jeff hammerland and I'm not really representing a specific stakeholders to the best of my knowledge I'm listed in the um the team Sheet there the the member sheet as retired professor and Senior fellow and that's accurate but but I'd like to say I'm actually a semi-retired professor because I still have about a 15% appointment with the uh Portland State University Center for Public Service and I chair our graduate certificate program in energy policy and management so still a couple fingers in that pie but not representing PSU per se I guess I would uh so I'm I'm as a as a semi-retired professor I would say my superpower that I'm trying to bring to this group is two things number one I have about 2,000 former students who are working in the in the energy field many of them most of them in Oregon including the few people who are on this call right now I was delighted to see um I also bring a lot of institutional memory I'm almost 74 years old I've been working in this field for many many years I taught at PSU for 30 years but before that I had a an energy career I we work for the US Senate energy committee uh senior manager at Southern California Edison uh see Senior policy Analyst at the Public Power um let's see consultant crit Vic um uh chair of the organ caucus of the northw Eng Coalition for 10 years Etc so I bring a lot I hope to bring a lot of institutional memory to this process that would probably be my other major contribution would be you know I'm on an advisory committee for BPA for many years and they would say hey Grandpa what what tell us what happened in 19 82 now did we try this in 1982 and I well yeah we did but here's what worked and here's what didn't work so I I hope to be able to bring that uh institutional memory to this process and I'm looking forward very much to working everybody I'm very excited about uh being able to continue to be able to contribute welcome glad to have you with us next up Jennifer bees good morning everyone so I am the director of environmental for the port of Portland and the port runs three airports for marine Terminals and five industrial business Parks so we're just really motivated to figure out what is the future of decarbonized Transportation look like what's the role that we can play using our assets given we're really interm modally connected you know we're doing a ton of work on our own emissions but that is really dwarfed um by our business partners ultimately that leverage our assets so really excited about the possibility to forge alignment and Partnerships and connections because the more we have of that the faster we can move and clearly there's some urgency here so really excited about this process welcome Jen next up Jennifer har morning hi my name is Jennifer hillart I use she her pronouns I am with the Oregon citizens Utility Board I am the policy and program director um we are a Statewide nonprofit that represents the interests of oregonians and um utility proceedings before the Public Utility Commission and also at the legislature um very excited about the being on this group um thrilled to have been accepted we're really looking forward to just working collaboratively with all the groups that are um all the interests and agencies that are interest involved in Oregon's new newer energy policies and seeing them imple get implemented um more efficiently we hopeful hope and um as and uh figuring out best ways to save costs for oregonians for um meeting all of our energy goals welcome glad to have you with us uh Jimmy Lindsay is up good morning everyone uh my name is Jimmy Lindsay thanks for including me um I'm here representing Portland General Electric uh the electric only utility here in Oregon the largest electric utility centered with a service territory centered around the northern lamit Valley um at PGE uh my role includes oversight of the integrated resource planning integr integrated resource plan and distribution system plan process um which are exercises that PG performs to identify you know the activities that the electric utility needs to perform over the the next 20 30 years and that work is very informed by uh the strategy of the state with respect to its energy policy and I'm really looking forward to hearing from this group of persons on",

        "text": " on that topic I know because I was on the losing side of of that decision uh that's why it it sticks in my mind so the board made a decision to not pursue a participating uh further and dedicating Washington County resources to better understand what it would take uh for such a proposal to work and be implemented by your County Government thank you for asking and chair correct me if I'm wrong but that would take a vote of the community yes but before uh we uh would entertain putting such a referral on the ballot through the County Commission we would first need to understand what would it mean for such a system to be put in place here in Washington County what obligation and services and Staffing would be needed at Washington County and our choice through these five members was not to invest any County resources into answering the doing the pre-work so to speak of what it would take that's all great thanks for clarifying that and commissioner Willie go ahead yeah thank you and I I'd kind of like to expand on that the um the preschool for all was going to be an initiative that would fund one particular segment of Social Services that we all agreed uh is a critical uh for our County and uh although we'd love to be able to fund all of these uh different aspects of it um it's a little bit of a death by a Thousand Cuts and so there's oh much only so much taxation that we can ask our constituents to support before we reach a point where they say no we're done with that and so we have to look at what it takes to provide all of the services that are required by us as a County Commission and as a county to provide the basic services for our County constituents and and I think what we're in the process of doing right now is defining what exactly those basic services are and once we do that then we we move ahead to what additional Services could we support and financially pay for so this is a this is a moving Target I believe that Multnomah County's preschool for all project um has not really proven itself to be successful so far so we will wait to see how that works but certainly as a county we are much more focused on how do we um the basic services that our constituents want and then look forward to what other services we could afford thank you commissioner Willie and uh commissioner Teresa would you like to comment before we move on to the next yes please thank you Julie um while I agree with uh with the comments that the chair made and uh the other comments that have been made I I want to call attention to the fact that I believe the question was really using preschool for all as an example so uh and that's that's an important piece of that question uh we uh you know we do need as um uh commissioner Willie was saying we need to look at the revenues at our revenues and consider how they support our current County Services and what we need to do what the money that we need to have to provide those services and I I would think that the next step if we were going to look at anything would be an operating Levy thanks for noting that commissioner okay we're going to move to the next slide please and I will take uh just in the last few minutes here I'm going to review the budget development process and where we go from here so as you recall uh when chair Harrington explained this earlier we're currently in that blue section that represents the internal phase of budget the next major Milestone is on April 27th as you heard earlier when the proposed balanced budget will be delivered to the budget committee and made public then the budget committee will hold a series of meetings in May and members of the public are more than welcome to attend and make comments and then in June there'll be two key meetings two public hearings to vote on whether it's one to approve the proposed budget and then to adopt the proposed budget and next slide please and as I said beginning April 27th the proposed budget will be posted on the County website and the easiest way to locate that is by going to the top of the page and clicking on priorities and that tab at the top and then directly underneath that on the county budget which will take you right to the information that you will need to to review also please be on the lookout for media releases social media posts newsletter articles between now and and mid-june because we are going to make a concerted effort to keep the public in the loop every step of the way and then uh we can go to the next slide which is another chance for Q a um we're we're coming to the close of our evening so I would say maybe Brenda is there one maybe burning question that maybe hasn't been addressed by the presentation so far that we could we could close out the question and answer period before we give the board a chance to to say final words for the evening I this is referring to one of the slides that Greg had posted I think but how are those I yeah in his section how are the outcomes measured and what if the outcomes are not positive or neutral seems like a perfect Target to reduce expenditures in other words if outcomes are not positive those Services should be cut I can take that one unless anybody else wants to so the so this is a great question because it talks about so what we've been talking about tonight is about budget that's inputs those are investments we make dollars we spend but the question that this brings up here is what do we what are the outcomes what are the results of those expenditures those Investments and this is uh really exciting because it's part of a much bigger strategic plan that I think I might have mentioned earlier but if I didn't and that's the question about setting the the longer term direction for the camp reviewing our existing strategic plan resetting our longer term uh Direction as a county and then through that process have a mechanism to measure the outcomes as they relate to our investments moving forward and then have a circle back function that says how are we doing with those outcomes which gives us a chance to adjust our inputs as we move forward so I think that's a great question and I'm looking forward to that as we move into more of a strategic planning process coming up here pretty soon thank you Greg and I would just uh add as well that um when you say outcomes it makes me think of our budget Equity tool that we haven't even touched on tonight and that context we're really looking at outcomes related to Equitable Service delivery and making sure that all members of Community are well served by the services that we do provide yeah that's exactly right well um with that I think I will turn it back to our Board of Commissioners so they can say some parting remarks and send us off into the evening I'll start it's Catherine chair Harrington I want to say thank you very much for sharing your time tonight your questions and your comments we're very much in listening mode uh and so we appreciate hearing from you both your questions about how we're going about this internal process so that our County Administrator and budget officer Ms Angie can present provide a balanced proposed budget To Us by the end of April and for us to then continue going through the public process and hear your comments at every single one of those seven or eight different meetings that we have coming up between the beginning of May and June 20th before we adopt whatever budget proposal we have at that stage your input your questions and your comments are important to us and does help shape our thinking thank you we value your input as we do this work for you we're all in service to you our community thanks and now turn it over to my district colleagues Commissioners any closing sure I'll go I'll go next chair since all right my pictures right next to yours uh this has been a really enlightening conversation and thank you so much Greg for your uh succinct um I feel like every conversation I have with you and Tanya about the budget um it's a it's a forever it's a forever changing element I feel like and every time I learned something new and and gain a different perspective of how we're handling our budget you know it's no secret that the the county it faces uh Financial challenges um and the counties already made some Cuts within the general funds um last year in the tune of 31 million uh and to be you know fair and honest and transparent these reductions or challenges have um direct impact to services but not just services but also to the people that deliver these services and now we're we have an additional 25 million that we need to make cuts to so I say this to with the community and the people that tuned in engage this conversation reach you know reach out to us we're very accessible we're very transparent and this is something that I think we're all it's all new I think um the last two years has been a challenging year for Washington County in terms of the budget and one of the constituents that asked about the question around the surprise element to this challenges I would say in some ways it is true you know this is a surprise but didn't come out of nowhere it has to do with some of the challenges and some of the situations that Greg talked about in his presentations but I'm really excited to figure out how we can minimize the impact to our services the impact to our employees and the people that deliver these services and I'm committed and I'm listening and whatever advocacy and you know information or any questions that I can facilitate to answer please know that I'm accessible and I'm on your side thank you and I turn it to next person thank you nafisa I I you followed the pictures I'll follow my picture and go next so um I I just want to say thank you to all the participants this has been really a very interactive uh town hall and that's how that's how we all learn and I I greatly appreciate it the there were many really good comments in the in the chat there were there were thought-provoking comments and things that that I'm certainly going to take away and be be thinking about as we go through this budget process so I want to I want to thank the participants I want to encourage you to continue to participate that is very very helpful to to us in this leadership role as we work for you all of the residents of Washington County uh be safe and I'll turn it over to commissioner Willie thank you and I don't mind at all uh being cleanup hitter here um",

        "text": " if you if it's easier for you to pull up the list that I sent along um so we can work along this together uh do so but you're right we've got um Austin um let's see we've got one yeah seven you're right is that what you said seven uh some of them are um zero to uh within the next two years and some are three to five years now so that's one way we could look at it is uh if there has a timeline on it to consider those as priority I like the idea of if for the ones that are just maintained you know maintenance ongoing make that the Action Pool I think maybe at least as we go through that something to keep in mind and and it can help us make a quicker decision maybe okay anybody else give your thoughts I know you guys are all excited about this I I think I think keeping with the existing priority structure is is clearly the the easiest way to keep it organized okay uh uh you know there'd be benefits to being more detailed and trying to really line things a higher level of organization on when things will actually an order in which things will be achieved Okay so let's work through the list and think about uh priority or normal is uh how whoever said that it was either Zach or Zach or Trevor um so on the so I'm going to start with the um the first one was submitted by public works this is a new one identify map and periodically revisit network of critical routes identify Street segments prone to flooding consider Bridge age and condition with within critical routes or is that a new one actually let me see yeah that's the new one thank you all right um we've got zero to two years on that one uh does that seem achievable this came from was it Anthony I can't remember who but this is the lead entity will be Public what five high priority actions yeah because it was like maybe that was a rewording of of what we had before which was just identify them and and I think we had landed on um our arterials were the priority Transportation routes and so it's identification was basically done so this was maybe a Next Step yeah this was a rewrite you're right so it it sounds like the first one from last time but it's just it's a rewrite and uh there might be a little bit more detail on the worksheet that I received from it and I can pull that worksheet up if I need to go and have them up right now thanks Randy for the thing in the chat if people are more willing to use the chat to give feedback uh feel free to do that I'll try to monitor it is this something that's achievable and zero two years that year timeline be changed would we consider this a priority or just a Action Pool normal I think it's achievable but it's also something that has to be maintained as uh as infrastructure conditions especially the bridges yeah so it needs to be maintained as an ongoing action but I'd say it's a high priority action because it uh impacts the ability to respond to any so to me this seems like maybe the the zero to two years part is actually identifying the street segments that are prone to flooding and then ongoing maintenance uh after that so I agree that this could be a priority so I've got three of you saying to go put in high um I'm gonna move on uh multi Hazard number two coordinate with capital Planning Commission we decide to keep this in there it's an ongoing one um my thinking is that it's uh not a high priority because that's where it was before but wanted to get your feedback on that okay Austin wants to keep it I'm gonna I'm gonna put normal in here even though or a week ago low maybe I'll do low it'll be easier to type anybody else before we move on I I agree with that ranking thank you okay multi-azord number three maintain an inventory of of the number and type of critical facilities within the community that are reasonable at a reasonable risk for each Hazard type this is an ongoing one this I believe was carried over from the last yep we changed this one's Main so and what we were saying before this would be in the low category or the um Everybody agree with that thank her okay got a few of you saying yes thank number four maintain public Outreach for all natural hazard risk risks addressed in the nhmb materials should include a mitigation action residents and businesses can Implement to reduce the risk of natural hazards and where they can obtain more detail blah blah blah let's see I think this one was a it is um we change develop to maintain um I would suspect that that will stay in the pool or in the normal if you agree thumbs up or just say yes and I'm the Cynthia can I ask in um I thought that was there was strong feeling that this was I don't know if Lo versus normal others might feel different but I thought in a discussion it might have been bumped up a little bit higher than a low but well I was putting low just for the ease of typing it should be normal yeah I'll put normal in there thank you okay uh mitigation number five action number five I'm sure updates consider specific hazards when updating the Salem code for mitigating for mitigating the location of future development and identified mapped High Hazard areas this is an ongoing it's a carryover last plan is it all right for me to um I know we had a chance to comment previously but is it all right if I drop a bit of wordsmithing in the chat for this one it feels a little redundant to me yep yes please do I feel like that wording is a little bit cleaner but I do think it should remain did I capture it all let's see I'm just doing this for my own ensure unified development code updates consider specific hazards and help to risk for future development and identified or mapped High Hazard areas that's good I'll keep that one as a normal action pool based on our discussions but again uh multi-hazard number six strengthen or replace unsafe public structures especially facilities critical to disaster and post-disaster planning and response this is an ongoing one that carried over um last time we just made a couple changes uh in the lead entity and partner organizations go unless you guys think otherwise I'll put this is in the normal action pool I guess I would just say I think this is a really important thing to do and I think that the city is working on but I I do think it's not something that's you know uh it has a specific end point so I don't it wouldn't it's okay to put uh I mean just because it doesn't have a timeline we could still list it as um high priority um I think it's something that the city's been or that Council has been um prioritizing in terms of upgrading the library in terms of upgrading um the Civic Center so I think it's an area where we are actively making progress too so what if we added identify and then strengthen or replace unsafe public structures because I'd say that's pretty important for us to continue to figure out what are our weaknesses in the community I agree with that were you thinking identify and strengthen or replace and plan plan to strengthen or replace because I think it this is a high priority but it's also something that is talking about you know Mill millions of of funds to actually accomplish that in most cases I do think us making it high puts more of an emphasis on it though versus I think it's a great idea to make it yeah so that's why I wanted to put identify in there so that we could you know there is something achievable that we can work on that's not just oh well that has to go out to a bond in order to accomplish any of the actual strengthening or replacing yeah so get give them some movement some recommendations on what they could be doing to move forward that's great great thank you that's good discussion so are you fine with the way I worded it identifying plans strengthen or replace and say public structures number seven maintain alert and Warning Systems this was a carryover where we changed uh it used to say I think continue developing um and now we changed it to maintain alert and Warning Systems I think this is a high and could we add something that we're not just maintain but continue to educate in there because no matter if we maintain it people don't know what it is or don't or know how to even have it on their phones I think that that that's a kind of a choke point about maintain and improve alert and Warning Systems this is Heather I might also add um testing kind of periodic practice runs for staff I don't know how we would word that but it feels like it's easy to use but it's something that we should continue to kind of just yeah that's a great idea uh Albany Albany uses their everbridge system for major incidents on a regular basis if a street Main Street or main artery in downtown is covered by an accident or a fire or police activity they use it and so that's how they practice they practice that for the main event so when they actually have to use it they know exactly what they're doing so it would be great if we could Implement something like that and do it on a regular basis more than once or twice every couple I like that so maybe it could be maintain improve and test Salem's alert systems blah blah blah I do think including something about educate the public at like at the end just a new sentence that's continue to educate the public about the systems I'm like that yeah I was just trying to think I there's I thought there was maybe it's up here more sorry if I'm going too fast Here you know part of the maintained public Outreach materials for all natural Hazard risks I was thinking that some of that might be grouped in there with the warning system but I I also can see separated and out um like that so okay so uh if you want to change my word and I'll let me know but we'll go with that okay a multi Hazard number eight continue to follow and enforce uh regulations pertaining to Hazard resistant construction um methods uh let's see this was I believe yeah this was from last time but we reworded it it used to say enhance Hazard resistance construction methods and we changed it to continue to follow and enforce regulations pertaining to Hazard resistant Construction that's where this one is today seems like a good one for the normal any other comments I concur multihazard number nine ensure City uh planning documents and regulations align align with regard to Natural Hazard mitigation and the actions in the National hazardation",

        "text": " will be updated it will be squared with a programmatic agreement that's adopted um section sex section 106 analysis and in the end the council can be assured that all archaeological resources on mr williams property and elsewhere along the alignment will be ms rachner is there any questions from okay thanks crow department of justice on behalf of the department of energy uh we agree with the statements that ms ratner just the recommended historic cultural resources condition one requires avoidance of direct impacts to archaeological resources and under the recommended condition two the applicant is required to finalize the historic properties management plan that will ensure that all sites on mr williams property are in conjunction with reviewing agencies and addressing a common theme with the approval of the department so again as we've been discussing if you have any concerns about those conditions please let us know but the department believes that those conditions provide the protections for archaeological resources on mr williams property from council council rat club so just as a reminder where we're at on the overall standard here the historic cultural archaeological resources we have two issues that were part of the contested case where exceptions were filed the other issue is hca3 the council has a choice to make here whether or not you want to do any additional deliberation on this issue and a straw poll on it or hold off until we've heard the other contested case issue um also note the time which is 12 10 and i don't uh you know when our next break is planned for but you know so that's just something else to consider whether or not you want to go ahead and do the deliberation on this issue now and take a straw poll or or hold off this might be a good time to go ahead and act on a straw poll for hca7 and then have do our lunch break and then come back and do hca 3. this is family i'd agree with that i see ann's thumb up that's it for the record top cornet so this is only going to be on hca7 not the standard and not hca3 just hca7 so and what i have is agree with the findings of fact conditions findings in fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue okay and if council's ready we're ready and buyer perry choctoot cindy condon hanley jenkins yes ken howe jordan truett yes thank you council okay we're going to take a 15-minute break to grab lunch and we'll be back for a working lunch 12 30. okay just one second here okay so um issue hca3 is one that has been raised by two parties marlette and gilbert the issue is whether the historic cultural and archaeological resources condition one which includes the hpmp and is related to mitigation for crossings of oregon trail resources provides adequate mitigation for visual impacts and sufficient detail to allow for public participation so the hearing officer's opinion a summary of that um as we discussed in reference to hca7 and is again has come up with a number of other standards the hearing officer concluded that the historic cultural and archaeological resources standard does not require that the applicant complete all tasks to ensure that project impacts are avoided minimized or mitigated prior to the issuance of a site certificate she also found that the standard does not mandate any specific methodology for assessing visual impacts and that the blm and shippo methodologies that their guidance does not align exactly with the council's definition of significant that further that the council council's statutes and rules established that the council may use information in the to make findings and impose conditions to ensure compliance with the standard she found that the proposed facility would not result in direct physical disturbance to any listed or likely nrhp eligible organ trail segment however the proposed facility would cross or be visible from oregon trail segments and therefore will indirectly impact those resources she also found that idaho power is not required to demonstrate completion or compliance with the section 106 process in order for the council to make findings of compliance under the cultural and archaeological resources the council doesn't enforce compliance with federal laws the methodology for evaluating the significance of visual impacts is established in the applicant's visual impacts to historic properties study which incorporates aspects of the bureau of land management and shippo guidance she found that limited parties marlat and gilbert did not provide persuasive evidence to support the contention that the proposed facility will result in significant adverse impacts to organ trail resources that cannot be mitigated further the department's recommended hca condition 2 would require consistent with the council's definition of mitigation that mitigation for all organ trail segments with an identified indirect impact must include first design modification which includes a height reduction and a particular kind of finish on the tower and second restoration preservation and or compensation to apply within the affected area of the impact the scope and scale of mitigation must be established prior to construction she finally found uh in reference to a court of appeals decision that uh um uh limited parties had cited a case called gould that this decision does not require further public review and the completion of the hp mp prior to finalization of the plan and the council's approval of the site and finally that uh one of the council statutes authorizes council delegation of future review and approval to the so again that's a summary of the findings and conclusions reached by the hearing officer and once again we have two limited parties who are going to be addressing this issue through oral argument ms gilbert or ms marlett want to come up first is up to them is that a recording okay am i on now and my good whatever uh is this better okay irene gilbert and this exception is due to the denial of my contested case stating in part the extent of damages to the public resources are not identified in relation to the necessary mitigation and most of the mitigation listed fails to apply to visual impacts odoa oregon department of energy rules state that mitigation must be specific and related to the item being mitigated the courts have also stated that it must actually address the impact the oregon trail is a priceless irreplaceable resource belonging to the citizens of the country you six people are about to decide whether or not you are going to allow idaho power to change the character of the resource for all future generations without providing legitimate compensation for the damages they will council is being asked to allow the b2h transmission line to be built between 125 feet to one half mile from 25 percent of the oregon trail resources in meeting the standard requires a complete application including specific identification of the resources impacted level of impact and actual mitigation that will be provided for damages that will exist from now on i listed multiple rules statutes court decisions that are intended to protect the resource none of these are currently being required for the developer some areas of non-compliance the proposed order does not require the developer to submit an amendment to the site certificate to add the information regarding sites not yet surveyed and require mitigation for the sites as required by the project order and council letter the council show told the public that there would be an amendment and that would allow for public discussion and disclosure for the the areas that are not included the file does not contain a preponderance of evidence that the construction and operation of the facility will not result in impacts to the archaeological resources listed are likely to be listed in the national register of historic places the procedure allowing completion of the historic properties management plan after a site certificate is issued waives the state statute which specifically state that you cannot waive state statutes draft historic properties management plan fails to show the developer will comply with the requirements of the rule the tables incorporated are not specific um there are lots of general statements we'll do one of these six different possible mitigation issues that is not meet the standard the councils relying upon this historic properties management plan but you have no idea what is actually going to be included in it and again the council is not doing the final approval the um the areas that are impacted by the development that are not previously identified including those with indirect impacts and identified specific mitigation being required to compensate for the impacts as well as requiring council review of the final historic properties management plan are not included in the current order so um appeal should not have my uh contested case should not have been denied the council should ultimately take authority for deciding whether or not this management plan actually is consistent with the statutes and the rules thank you miss gilbert are there any questions from the council and the statutes and all of that are included in my written uh material so please do review them thank you i lost my thing i was not going to be oh never mind i'm joanne marlett and i have been involved in this proposed transmission corridor since 2007 and i'm a limited party to this contested case with issue hca 3. my understanding is that the purpose of this meeting is to make sure idaho power has met the f-sec standards for compliance the issue on hand is whether idaho power adequately provided mitigation for visual impacts and sufficient detail to allow for public participation visual effects on historic properties tend to especially risk the alteration of characteristics that qualify a property for the national register of historic places when these effects diminish the integrity of setting and or feeling of that property the national historic oregon trail interpretive centers segments of the oregon trail and the on-the-ground version of the pioneer experience experience walking the trail will be damaged by the proposed b2h utility corridor forever the interpretive center was designed so visitors walking remnants of the oregon trail would see the vast open space to the west as a pioneer saw them if this proposed utility quarter were needed appropriate mitigation is to require idaho power to bury portions of the line that would visually impact the historic oregon trail as well as the view shed in front of nahotec in the cross-examination hearing in january gail garbiner asked idaho powers witness dennis johnson of powers engineers about line burial he said it was definitely feasible he even came up with a better placement for underground where the ends of the line would come up out of the ground in a less visible and less obstructive way that meant the line would be buried for approximately 1.7 miles which as stated above is feasible idaho power claims that bearing the",

        "text": " which I'm happy to organize but at the end of the day I think where it gets to is we want to initiate some sort of code change and then I assume that would fall on staff and I guess the question is kind of what level of tolerance or ability is there for us to you know explore four or five issues and then say okay I would want to pull the trigger on this one or that one and how does that process work in a way that fits in with the current demands on staff time well I am not speaking for Lisa because I am not in this shop but I think that's where prioritizing the issues comes into play so if solars are number one or if it's you know enhancing more or walkable Equitable communities one or one or two of those we've got a butt stamp which is of highest priority and I know there's usually an ongoing list of suggested changes updates to the UDC that they do every few years so but however we just still are enthusiasm to a tolerable amount it would hopefully go on that okay yeah so I think really would be helpful to hear about that list and not been on the list of having a picture on the list it's just okay yeah take what's up for lunch notice certain trends like I'll give you a bit a multi-family housing for example there are a lot we don't have the perfect flat locks anymore that are so easy to build on we just we're running out of those so how do we make changes to the UTC and we did make them so that there are exceptions to the rule and and it takes into account that it is geographically not a good little it's a triangle at this time so we make changes to address that when we see Trends coming in front of them either Lisa's staff or Planning Commission that you we note so that's where we pay attention I know staff is definitely paying attention to those Trends but it is a conversation with as we said can we get this on the list but we can't give you 50 things I mean 50 issue items it might be one issue with lots of suggested changes but um I think that's where we have to be mindful but follow-up I can see your no no no no I right I agree with that I think that would be I think we have a process that would allow us to explore new issues and rank one or two of those issues that would be a significant to do and I think we've done that in the past we just have never identified it as a priority um you know the example I gave multi-family housing none of the Commissioners said oh this is going to be a priority no they just noticed a you need to see changes well um you know I agree that the commissioner schlater about not spinning out the staff with too much to do but but but he's right it's a good idea to come forward but things we're interested in that we believe in changes and rank them and I think that's important I think we need to expand okay what we do okay I was just going to ask Lisa do you feel that your team even has the bandwidth to be able to take it uh some extra work on no no I mean we do keep a list so we call the bucket list um that breast keeps and so when things come up either something small like oh that's not that's not what we've invent or identified through an application or something some are small some are big some have been on there a long time they're not doing the tackle um but every time every few years we do a code Amendment um we go through the list um or if we're doing it unless it'd be totally unrelated but or like this is small we can add an end um so why some of our ordinances are so long when we get to the code limit um but rice is actually currently so he just most the code right he's a parent planner and he's a senior career planner and he has all the design projects um all the kind of really big complex projects everything in Fairview and excuse area all that was incredibly um and you know him and Aaron are the only senior planners and so all the rest of the staff or you can make it lots of bacon season um or their dinners that I'm going to plan our course a year so his time is really constrained the units does code amendments but first come out of long-range projects and uh you know she's more than beloved at the top with big climate friendly rules the state has um our transportation plan that we're updating you know she's like well actually liaison she's just this pledge season was crazy like every bill has to do with housing and planning um you know you'd have to be concerned so you're about advocacy I'll just stay up here do you want to be able to apply any standard after June you should be paying attention to what's going on in the legislature right now um because it may not matter our opinions or any of our sign standards or anything else we adopt the roles that are being considered the laws that are inconsideration I should say um so is difficult but I don't think that there's anything wrong in identifying projects and priority priorities and then we can spot those in I mean I but never can guess what our workload or our staff mean is going to you know look like six months a year out I mean we do have a lot of our Salem projects for our Long Beach cleaners but maybe we'll get another long-range planner um you know the council can be convinced we have two and you know Eugene has eight to the same size so um we're severely understaffed in long-range planning um but we keep a list and we never know when we're going to get to it um so I don't think there's anything wrong with the commission identifying especially because uh some of the things that we're talking about are also being talked about at other committees and commissions and the ages you know Urban relations that kind of stuff so I think it could be overlapped um I just think on some of those I'm not the expert because they're not in the planning Division and so as I was looking at commissioner agencies list of what's being seen you know you or maybe interested in I was thinking that maybe some of what we need to do is have some like cross meetings with people that are from other departments or commissions and um so we can get a better understanding of what they're doing and how it relates because I'm not an expert housing but I know the city's doing a lot of it I just can't come here and like rattle It Off um I also think and I did get some clarity on the mayor's desire to look at words and conditions and what everybody's working on and if their parents are right you know makeup and and or test the right things um and they do have a consultant that's going to start doing that work in July um it might be a good idea also if the funding commission wants to put something together about how you're feeling about you know you know what you're tasked with or what you think you can take on I think there's overlap with other things so that that can be part of that study I don't have any Clarity on If part of that study will be even interviewing you all so I mean as it gets closer we'll find out but um so it's kind of Timely good time to have that's not that was a long answer to not what you asked me but wouldn't you let me talk yeah so it so it sounds like this project would help us outside of staff's time like as a Planning Commission getting together outside of the city staff's time as a group and probably starting this project yeah I assume that when we meet if there still needs to be established involved notice and taping requirements but there's nothing in this committee that's below quorum is that right yeah so for people four or less yes well yeah I think continuous to some extent this comes down to an issue about what we're going to organize it by using you can't just certain ideas um some committee that starts to lay out a plan for what information you want to get how to get it and where to get it it doesn't necessarily involve uh staff making a presentation I'm gathering information themselves we do that on public participatories yes that you are working you can utilize that by some of our meeting time this for that purpose and uh and so I I think that if we said some priorities that we can figure out the best way to organize it so that's kind of being in different stages and we we will as soon as these laws when some of these legislative decisions and other students are made we're going to have those things brought to us I assume a little bit of briefing session something like that so we'll be getting some of that information you know I'm trying to go through a little of the issues that I've heard people talk about or that I have solar was one of them I I've told people I I still think that they connection between the transportation plan and the and uh or say lemon r atings planning uh meets an examination that's already set up but we'll do um I think the issues of column amenities but were raised last uh electric vehicle charging stations Open Spaces community facilities and large developments um and even the walkable uh putting those all in this amenities category but you know we were talking before the meeting about how we have new regulations that may accelerate them replacement of gas vehicles with electric vehicles and are we ready for that just relying on the market electric vehicles so those sort of we've always there's there's another one which is a you know affordable housing again this is one where it's more for us it's part of the tracking trying to figure out whether or not we're actually going to get through incentives what we plan that seems to be something that comes from a very good process uh not necessarily something there so I you know we've got solar design we've got the local Pathways together things that that I can remember other people bringing up necessarily characterizing I mean the specificity that other people I think we could go through those and then that could and that means that if they are a priorities to me that means that we've got Commissioners that are interested in those and that we could organize uh you know some committee fashion to figure out the best ways to approach them and work with staff on how to do that and then how to work and maybe more games that's a great approach that let's have that",

        "text": " even states in the report that she's in Arabian. And they tend to run thin in general. And they, you know, I ended up getting a coggins on them and placing them with a lady within, I think, three months from that case being opened after it was closed in June of 2018. And in regards to the incident in 2014, I think it was, I had had surgery, and I did not realize that the health certificate was two days past the date because it's only good for 30 days. I literally showed up at court in a wheelchair with the bandages still on. And I told the judge I had offered to pay the actual vet bills, and I offered to also reimburse them for the dog 100%. They said no. They wanted to take me to court. So I said, okay. I said, I'm offering to pay for everything. They said, no, they wanted to take me to court. The judge ruled that I reimbursed them the cost of just the dog. They asked for attorney's fees to be paid. The judge said, no. They said, she is going to reimburse you the $650, I think it was for the dog, which I had offered to pay the $200 for the vet bill and the dog. So the judge only sided with the cost of the dog, which is in the statute of. But you're supposed to be reimbursed. I apologize to them that it was, you know, two days past the health certificate date, that was my bad. And I. That's why I had offered to pay the vet bill and reimburse them 100% with a dog. It was around $875 that I had offered to pay them. They said, no, they want to take it to court. And again, like I said, the judgment was, I think it was for dollar 650. I paid it that day because I was prepared to send them the money before we even went to court because I knew I was in the wrong. You know, when you know you're in the wrong, you want to make things right. And that's what I was trying to do. The other thing was regarding, I'm waiting on engineering specs for the building, because in order to submit a. For a permit, you have to have the engineering specs for the building. And in your packet, you'll see the letter from Overholt, which is the company that I bought the kennel from. They apparently did not have any type of specs, engineering specs done for me to get approval to submit that, to put the building and get a kennel, you know, approval and everything like that. So I've been waiting on them to give me the engineering specs. They're working on it right now to get that set. And I had also included. I'm wanting to put in a septic system. If you look through the packet, there's Marion pumpers. They have submitted an email, and also there's several. Where is it here with the estimate being around like $3,000. So basically it have its own septic system right after the kennels. And I'm willing, you know, to do whatever the board wants me to do. That's why it's also submitted the commercial dog kennel pricing for like a six bay or a twelve bay. It'd be around $40 to $50,000. They'd be completely closed in with AC, and it obviously have to be permitted, but this takes time, and I'm ready and willing to do it. But like Mister Odom had said, he said, don't go, you know, putting a new building in another one, and then, you know, we can't get it approved. Then. As far as the letters I also submitted, showing how far away I am from the one house, the gentleman that had said he's over on Southeast 47th Avenue, I think I'm 787ft from his property. And then my neighbor across the street, Wanda, I'm about 181ft from her, and she's the one that I show you the letter that she sent. And also Judy Benoit. She's about 500ft from my house. She lives across the street, like Caddy Corner, Katie Corner, however you say it. And then I also submitted other letters of people that I, you know, have gotten animals for me in the past. We also went and bought vibrate collars for everybody. And I actually, I was trying to do a thumb drive so I could do the videos on 4 July all weekend long with fireworks. I have videos at 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 at night showing the dogs not even barking. We even set off fireworks right in my yard. Nobody even barked because of the vibrate collars. They have been working and we have been teaching them. No. And right now, currently there's only about seven dogs that are outside. All of my smaller dogs are all in the house. So then that way, you know, they're not out there. We also installed a sprinkler timer mister system on all of the kennels, which brings down the heat index. I also got a gun that showed the temperature and there's also a picture in there. If you see the orange picture with the kennels, that was at the hottest part of the day. And before that they were around 100. It was around 100 to anywhere from 100 to 105. Now it's down to about 85. With the misters. Significantly reduces, you know, the temperature. But I can put. I can have a concrete if the board, you know, would like me to do so, or just have a specific, you know, custom building built with, you know, the only thing I don't like to do is I don't like to have them permanently enclosed inside because what if AC fails? Just like the woman here in Florida that had her dogs in a building was banking on the AC to keep them cool. She had them enclosed. She left and was gone for somewhere around 8 hours. And all the dogs, almost all of them died of a heat stroke. The dog should not be sequestered 100% into a building. Even if it has ac. They shouldn't. They should be able to go in and out of runs because it's safer for the dog. I am an advocate for dogs. If you see the pictures that I also supplied, those are not my dogs. Those are dogs that I have rescued over the last five years. There is a little tiny chinese crested boy and girl. If I was a puppy mill, I could have kept them. They were unrelated. I could have bred them. No. One's up in New York City and one's in Jacksonville. And I'm still friends with those people to this day. Two and a half years ago. Same thing with the great Pyrenees I've rescued. There was a family of five kids and their husband and wife. They had mold in their rental, and they had to be moved into a smaller house. And they had two great Pyrenees, a male and a female. The male was already fixed, and I offered to hold the male while they looked for another place. They ended up moving back to Kentucky, and I held him for free, paid for everything, fed them for four months, and they picked them up and took them with them when they left. And I did it for free. My vet bill just this year from January to June with Clay Oaks veterinarian, is, I think it was over $5,000. And that's not including the two c sections that I had to do two weeks ago, which one was around $1,000, and another one was around 800. So just in total for this year, I'm already over about $8,000. Do I make a profit? No, do not make a profit. If there is a need. I've had people just drop dogs off at my house before, literally put them over the gate and leave them there or leave a note or tie them to the fence. I've had them do that because they know that I'll take them, and they know that I'll get them vetted and get them shots and, you know, find homes for them. And half the time, I don't even ask for a rehoming fee. I just. Let me ask you a couple of questions. Sure, sir. On the noise and the smell that was presented, what was the situation there? Well, my neighbors come over all the time, and they. I specifically asked them. I'm like, have you noticed anything in Wanda, who lives directly in front of my driveway? She was like, no. When she even wrote the letter for me that she has not noticed, you know, any poop. They've come over, and they've been welcomed over many times in my yard because I've been showing them all the stuff that I've been doing and updating, too, actually, I go over there and ask them if I can borrow a tool or something. And, you know, Robert and Wanda are pretty much my closest neighbors, and I've offered them, you know, like, if they ever need a power washer or something, you know, they can use mine. I've. I mean, I have several neighbors that have never had an issue. And, I mean, whatever any issue is, I'm also trying to reduce down. So then that way, in the last three weeks, I've gotten rid of about four dogs that were a little bit more of a barker. So, unfortunately, because of the situation, they had to go. They had to be rehomed. Let me go ahead and interrupt you just a minute. Are there any other key issues that you want to present? We got a lot of hearings",

of the river using horizontal um the second option which is noted as option two on this map would come on land around Brown Beach uh and then would follow the right-of-way for Marine Drive to the uh the proposed converter station site um there's also a a two options proposed to connect the converter station site to the North Lombard Street right of way um and those are basically just different routes that would cross the Columbia slew uh and the Ramsey Wetlands um as I mentioned these corridors can change but right now this is what's proposed for the western side um we were in The Dalles last night so uh and next slide please um we did just want to show that the on uh land segment on the Eastern side of the line uh would come on to land around the Dallas Marina uh and the riverfront park there and then would be uninstalled under I-84 using a horizontal drilling uh it then follow Thai Plant Road uh to around Three Mile Creek and then basically follow oh East 2nd Street Highway 30 and Highway 197 up to the BPA complex where where the the Eastern converter station site is proposed next slide please okay uh and Todd talked a little bit about uh our coordination with reviewing agencies and special advisory groups um just to be queer those those terms include state agencies with either uh jurisdiction or or subject matter expertise in natural resources cultural um most of the permitting aspects of the facility that will be reviewed by the council ultimately reviewing agencies are asked to provide comments on the proposed facility uh within their jurisdiction and make recommendations regarding the size and locations analysis area is just like we've asked for the Public's uh input on those um the uh the reviewing agencies are also identified to identify studies that should be conducted to identify potential impacts uh I identify legal requirements that may be applicable to the review of the application and any permits that might apply to construction and operation of the proposed facility um I want to point out that the the term special Advisory Group is another form of reviewing agencies but those refer to the the governing bodies of all the local governments in which the facilities propose to be cited so we've been reaching out to County Board of Commissioners local city councils um all of your local elected officials to get their input especially on the requirements for the land use review we've also separately reached out to tribal governments that might be affected by this proposal task for their input as well uh and and offer them opportunities to meet with the department or provide input in other ways if you could get the next slide I'll go over this again towards the end of the presentation or after the the Q a session but uh there is an opportunity to provide public comment on the notice of intent um we're requesting all written comments to be submitted to the department by June 1st um any comments that we receive will be posted to our website and provided to the applicant we've received a handful so far that you can find on there um uh comments may also be provided during the Q a session at this meeting um and again we just want to point out that this isn't a public hearing tonight so uh you're welcome to ask any questions you have about the the project um you're welcome to provide comments um but uh again you are not required to do so to re uh to maintain any sort of standing later in the process um and then yeah I think with that I will uh turn it over to the applicant team to give you a presentation about the project thank you it's not working is the is is that any better a little bit better okay I'll speak up to it I'm Chris Hawker I'm with the Cascade renewable transmission project and I want to thank the doe staff and all of you for coming out to learn more about this project uh I also want to acknowledge uh right up up top that we're very conscious of the fact that the Columbia River Gorge area and lands on far beyond that to both the East and the West are uh historically The ancestral homelands of tribal Nations so we have um uh over the last couple years reached out to tribal Nations to let them know about the project to welcome their questions and to hear any concerns there is a formal process under the federal NEPA uh for that kind of consultation between but that doesn't prevent us from engaging uh and informing and so we want to have an authentic relationship uh with the tribes and uh I think we should all acknowledge the importance of that uh as was said this is a proposed 100 mile give or take uh transmission line that will be uh with the exception of 500 feet at the Eastern interconnection will be entirely underground or underwater about 83 miles underwater about 17 miles in three segments we're going to want to focus primarily on the what of the project and the where of the project but I think for context it's important to talk a little bit about the why we should be at the next slide sorry I'll I'll let you the whole project motivation stems from um uh passage in both Oregon and Washington of legislation that mandates that the States achieve decarbonization and clean energy goals and even though the Oregon legislation and the Washington legislation are somewhat different they amount to the same thing and a key part of both is that of the goals that were set 80 of those goals need to be met by the year 2030. you think of 2030 as quite a ways away but transmission projects like this are long lead time projects we've actually been looking at this and and trying to develop it for the last three years before we could even get to this part uh tonight so with an 80 uh carbon neutral requirement or carbon free requirement depending on the state I think the uh challenges of of Meeting those goals next slide please have been pretty well established and as this slide indicates uh it's it's been quite publicly acknowledged by uh Utilities in the region that it will be very very difficult to meet those goals without new uh being developed and built so that's really the motivator of this project the uh most efficient and best renewable resources at scale at the kind of scale that is needed uh are all to the east of the Cascades not just Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington but even further uh East in States like Montana and Wyoming for wind plants and solar plants at scale next slide please even now uh the transmission capacity across the Cascades is severely constrained so that even now a developer of solar or wind regardless of where that is east of the Cascades can't really get that kind of renewable energy across the Cascades to the West because there isn't enough transmission capacity available at many times of the year at the same time there's an increase in energy demand due toward the impetus of electrification whether it's buildings or Vehicles so there's a a growing drive for electrification uh for everything we and it's worth noting I think most of us would acknowledge that a traditional overhead major transmission line has its own set of challenges can create problems in terms of getting them permitted and built next slide here's the solution that we are and I've got a slice of a power cable a bundle consisting of two of these can carry 1100 megawatts so as you can see by the right hand that is what the bundle looks like the little cable on top is a fiber optic cable for internal Communications of the and as Ernie will explain uh how that's actually installed underwater but here you have enough power to power eight hundred thousand homes that can be carried if necessary 24 hours a day seven days a in a bundle like this next slide actually you saw this map uh from the department but um uh you know on a very high level it goes from The Dalles and the east at the Big Eddy substation uh I'm sure you're aware that there's a large BPA complex up continues on into the river until you get to the Bonneville Dam goes around the Bonneville Dam by land on the Washington side all buried goes back in the river uh to the uh western part where we would uh bring it onshore on Hayden Island about Midway on Hayden take it over across the south channel uh over to Marine Drive and there's a converter station site in the Rivergate industrial area which I'll go into a little bit but it's a it's a currently vacant site that is owned by the port of next slide this was all already presented but just to repeat a little bit you can see where the proposed converter station and we'll talk about converter stations in a bit uh would be located right adjacent to the Big Eddy substation taken down highways buried uh into the Dalles uh the only thing I would uh uh perhaps clarify from what was said is that uh south of I-84 it would be horizontally directionally not only under I-84 but also under the marina or avoiding the marina so it would be one long drill into the water without any trenching uh on the right hand uh uh Chris presented the uh two Alternatives that we had in our noi I can tell you with about 98.2 percent certainty that alternative to which would come out at Broughton will not be presented in the application uh there are issues associated with that route we needed it at the time for an alternative uh so that we could have a um as we were exploring the Hayden Island alternative alternative one uh that's been pretty much cleared up uh there will be a slight change modification to the route on Hayden Island to avoid there's a dredge spoil area there and we were told by the port of Portland that we don't want to try to trench across that so we're going to avoid that it's a minor minor jog in the route and there may be some other modifications for Hayden Island but it is not going to affect the overall concept of the project next slide the Bonneville Dam bypass is shown here it's about seven miles uh we have done primarily desktop studies but also supplemented with actual surveys in the on areas that we've already identified as being difficult to install a cable in one of those areas is the area just east of the Bonneville Dam and so uh in order to uh avoid that set of problems in terms of installing the cable we are proposing to bring it out uh of the river in Stevenson uh to bypass that",

        "text": "all right good evening and welcome the time is now 501 pm and I would like to call the August 24th 2023 meeting of the energy facility citing Council to order Mr secretary please call the roll Mercy Grill here Ken Howe here Jordan Truitt here here Cindy Condon here here Perry talk to and buyer here Richard Devlin Madam chair you have a quorum thank you Mr secretary are there any agenda Madam chair there is one agenda modification unfortunately we're not able to get the July meeting minutes um done in time they're close to being drafted we should have those out soon just not quite ready um they're quite complicated from last time so um those aren't ready so in terms of the first agenda item there will be no need to take action on those thank you I have the following announcements for tonight's public hearing on obsidian solar center amendment number one an agenda item C public comment period there are three ways to let us know you are in this is Cindy can anybody hear me I can hear you Cindy so I have lost I can't hear anything else yeah I've lost did did you all use lose sound too I'm gonna text Todd since I don't see a way to chat needy energy facility citing council meeting shall be conducted in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to State their positions at the appropriate time I think she would mute again Jordan or Cindy can you hear him cannot uh Perry I can hear you okay how about now can you hear us now yes okay thank you all right um so we are going to move forward as um previously stated we will not be taking action on the July minutes at this time so our next item on the agenda is the Council secretary report Mr secretary thank you madam chair um first I have uh Council updates so I had recently heard from the governor's office that they are not moving forward with replacement for councilmember truitt's position so councilmember truitt's term ends September 22nd um next month so they are now the governor's office is now looking at the November legislative days instead of the the Sip or yeah September legislative um so as we had this conversation you know this question come up numerous um even if a council member's term ends they're technically still on the council until they resign or until they're replaced so I reached out to council member Truitt and he's graciously agreed to stay on until he is replaced we very much appreciate that and so certainly we'll be working with the governor's office to try to find a replacement uh for November next I have project updates the first is the Muddy Creek energy project this is a proposed 199 megawatt solar project and battery storage approximately eight miles south of Brownsville and immediately east of Interstate 5 we received the notice of intent on May 19th of this year on July 25th of this year we held a public information meeting in Brownsville we had approximately 100 people attend in person including council member Condon in person and council member buyer remotely the comment period closed on August 11th and in total we received 142 so 80 of those comments were submitted through our comment portal um so I wanna you know kind of provide some kudos to Wally and Rit department so this is something that we've worked on in the last couple of years to provide another alternative method for people to provide public comment and we're increasingly seeing the use of that and you know one of the values is there's an opportunity to tie comments directly to council standards so while not everybody did that and at the public information or the public the excuse me the notification no notice of intent stage it's a little more nebulous but that being said is we did get you know quite a few people attempting to connect their comments to standards which is great and I think that will help as we move forward um so I think that's a big a pretty big Outreach in terms of the number of comments none of those were what I call Robo comments these were all individual people submitting individual comments um so that's a pretty big number and obviously with the conversion of Farmland in the Willamette Valley of high value Farmland there's a lot of interest on this project any questions before I move on to the next one or any Impressions by councilmember Condon or council member buyer who are in attendance um this is Anne buyer and I didn't listen into most of the presentation I want to give staff um particularly for that trying to keep the focus on the standards because I think that really helped to educate all the people who were there it sounded like a very packed house and and that's a good thing but I think it helped Focus the discussion it was a robust discussion I learned a lot from the people who made comments at this really early stage so um as Council secretary Cornett observed we will have a lot of comments on this and and a lot to sort through so thanks to staff thank you what and I am said I'm getting some feedback you're fine on our end just in case okay um and one of the things I I was struck by is that the uh people present um were seem to be frustrated that they hadn't heard about the project beforehand and I I don't know how that gets remedied um but I think um applicants um could work harder on that that's just an impression I I got for that comment okay moving on to the Summit Ridge wind farm so on August 17th we received amendment number six for the Summit Ridge wind farm this is an approved 194 megawatt wind farm located in Wasco County approximately 17 miles Southeast of the Dallas the project was originally approved in August 2011. uh amendment number six proposes to reduce the total number of wind turbines from 72 to 32. uh but increase the size of the 32 wind turbines add up to 47 megawatts of solar PV energy generation and Associated uh relatedness supporting facilities which will include amending the site um to uh to be able to have that and then request the construction completion deadline be amended from August 19th of 2023 to August 19th of 2026 so they have begun construction there's some um you know enough to justify that they've begun construction but the the major components of the facility have not next on my list is the sun stone solar project during my last Council secretary report in July I indicated that we were close to receiving a preliminary application for that project we've now received it as I'd indicated during that meeting the project when it came in under the notice of intent was called the echo solar project they renamed it to the Sunstone so this is in Morrow County approximately 15 miles Northeast of Lexington and really beginning at the southeast corner of the Boardman bombing range it's proposed as a 10 900 acre or 17 square mile solar next I have related to Wildlife monitoring updates so all site certificates for wind energy generation facilities include a requirement to implement a wildlife monitoring and mitigation plan where the plan includes short and long-term monitoring and potentially mitigation measures that's what's included in each of those plans for five of the facilities that have been proved by the council these Wildlife monitoring mitigation plans include a requirement that applies to the department and that the department must make the results of annual monitoring available for public comment these facilities include State Line win projects big low Canyon Wind Farm leaning Juniper 2A leaning Juniper 2B and the Klondike 3 win project to support making the results available the department prepares a staff memo to council that was provided to council as part of your packing materials this summarizes the results of the prior years monitoring for each of these and this information was also posted to each of the project web pages with a 60-day comment time frame so long-term monitoring these facilities includes five-year monitoring for Raptor Nest use and three-year monitoring for Washington ground squirrel activity and annual incidental Wildlife monitoring and Reporting so the information was provided to council it was posted on the project pages and is currently open for public comment in case anybody is interested in commenting next I have an update on rulemaking so uh the council recently gave us direction to move forward on the contested case rulemaking so Tom Jackman has initiated that so the first rulemaking advisory committee meeting for that rulemaking will be on September 7th from 9 to 11. that will include introducing what the rulemaking project is in going over ideas with rulemaking advisory committee members about any issues or areas of concern that they're interested in focusing on during the rulemaking if there are any council members who would be interested in um I think it'll likely be remote you could certainly come in but likely call in or or join the the webinar if you are interested please reach out to either me or Tom and we can get you that information about how to join on September 7th from 9 to 11. I've got a few comply or two compliance updates the first is related to The Shepherd's flat South facility this is a wind energy facility located in Gillum and Morrow counties the facility consists of 116 turbines with a peak generating capacity of 290 megawatts the facility commenced operation in September of 2012. on August 15th of this year the department was notified of a ferriginous hawk fatality caused by suspected turbine Collision so um presumably they found you know the the dead Raptor at the base of the uh the uh turbine so there's a certificate holder documented the fatality um with its Wildlife incident report so they provided information to us Timely next is the Montag solar facility that also has a name change um I'm somewhat disinclined to try to State the name uh because I I don't think I will pronounce it correctly and I will get there in the future um but for now we'll just say the what is formerly known as the Montag solar facility so it is recently operating a commenced operation on April 25th of this year it's 162 megawatts and it's in gillham County on August 15th of this year the department was notified that electrical connectors associated with the project caused a 2.5 acre brush fire so something failed with the electrical equipment and sparked a wildfire or a brush fire it was limited to ",

        "text": "right good evening everyone and welcome to the public information meeting on the complete application for site certificate for the Sunstone solar project um I'll note that we are both in person here in Boardman tonight as well as online and uh this meeting is being recorded we'll go ahead and post a copy of the recording to our website in the next few days so anybody that's not here uh can listen to the discussion and anybody who is here can listen again if if they want um my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy um I will be uh facilitating the review of the application for site certificate um I'm joined we're joined here tonight also by the gate Renewables team uh who's the developer of this project I'll have them I'll introduce themselves in a little bit after my my presentation um yeah and if mancy you could go to the next slide um I'll give us a quick rundown of what we will be um talking about tonight uh first uh we we just had a Mee and greet so thanks everybody for coming out and I hope you got some good discussion in with the applicant team uh and as at the department um if you uh didn't get a chance I did just want to point out that we have a computer set up towards the door where you can sign up for email updates from the Department you can preview our aressa mapping tool which I'll give a little bit of a overview of in a minute um and you can also see just other information about the energy facility sting Council and and the work it's doing there um I'll be going over that a little bit in our presentation as well um so uh I will be providing a quick overview of the energy facility sighting process which is the state level permitting review um I'll also be giving as I just mentioned an introduction over the Oregon renewable energy citing assessment tool or aressa um which is a good publicly accessible mapping tool so you can see some more details about this project and other energy facilities um I'll then be turning it over to the applicant team to give a more detailed overview of this Sunstone solar project uh and then um we'll be taking questions and answers from the audience both people that are here in person with us today and those on the webinar right um so the energy facility sighting Council review process is a Consolidated review at an oversight process for most large scale energy facilities and infrastructure Oregon uh in addition to solar facilities the council or FC um has jurisdiction over large scale wind facilities um large thermal projects uh some transmission lines uh and some pipelines um the council is made up of seven volunteers from around the state they are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate um and odo's sighting division so Odo the Oregon Department of energy sighting division is staff to fsac and I do want to point out before we get going that we do have um at least one council member in the room with us council member Imes and I believe we have council member Byer joining us on the webinar as well um thank you both for being here we really appreciate it um uh yeah so move next slide um so what the council does is uh review typically applications for site certificate which is the request for the state level permit for a large energy facility um or request for amendment of a site ific which is another administrative process in the application for site certificate process there's seven major steps um some of you may have been out here maybe Logan remembers better than I do uh a year ago two years ago when we had a similar meeting as tonight on the notice of intent um two years ago all right uh which the notice of intent is the first document that the department receives it gives the applicants kind of General proposal for an energy facility uh and gives the department the chance to establish the legal standards uh applicable laws and rules that would apply to that review uh which we put in a project order which you'll see noted as the Second Step um the applicant responds to all of uh the information requests in the project order as well as the other information requests in our administrative rules uh in their application for site certificate or ASC um that's the process we're in or the part of the process we're in now um the application uh contains uh a lot of information it is available on our website uh I'll talk a little bit more about what's in there uh specifically um but there are a number of exhibits talking about everything from land use to fish and wildlife habitat to cultural resources so if you have specific questions about this project or what resources it might impact um most most of the answers should be there and if you ever need help navigating that um you can find information for uh my information on our our project page um you can also find the applicants information if you have questions for them um after the ASC uh the department will after we review the ASC the department will prepare What's called the draft proposed order um I'll get into a little more detail about what that uh entails in later slides but generally the draft proposed order is the Department's initial findings of facts and recommended conclusions of Law and recommendations other recommendations to the Council on whether there or not the facility would comply with all the applicable requirements and whether or not we recommend that the council should issue a site certificate um there is a uh public comment process associated with the uh draft proposed order members of the public can submit public comments both on what's in the DPO or the draft propos order um and on the application itself uh and it's important to note um that to preserve your standing or uh to to preserve the ability to participate later in the process if there's a contested case you must comment on the DPO uh during that comment period so I'll bring that point up several times just because it's very I think important if you're interested in participating in this Pro process um so the after the the comment periods over um the the department will present its recommendations and all the comments to the council and then we'll prepare a proposed order um and along with that proposed order will come a notice of contested case uh where people if they disagree with our recommendations can request a contested case hearing on on issues um again I'll just repeat that only persons who raise a relevant issue in person at the public hearing uh in writing or in writing by the Comon deadline on the DPO May participate in that contested case and that that process is run by an independent hearing officer that's appointed by the council usually that's somebody from the Oregon office of administrating hearings but it could be another third party or a member um so after the contested case uh proceeding is done or is run its case um or if there's no issues um kind of immediately the the council or FC will be reviewing the um the proposed order the information in the SC and making their final decision on uh whether they will approve or deny the application for okay um okay so just to show kind of how this this facility or this project has worked um so yeah as as I mentioned we we got the notice of intent uh in 2022 and we again had that informational meeting out here at that time uh we issued a project order that September and then got the preliminary application for site certificate uh in just about a year ago in June of 2023 um the department has consulted with our other agency partners uh tribal governments and local governments um to make sure that the information in that preliminary application was complete and contained sufficient information for us to recommend findings to the Council on all the applicable laws rules and standards um the applicant responded to all those requests and uh issued their complete application uh just last month on May which is the again the application that contains all the information that the department determined would be sufficient for us to findings um so from this point on we are a little speculative on on our timeline but our best guest at this point is that we'll be issuing that draft proposed order in June or July so towards the end of the month um or early next month and at that time we'll be issuing a public notice that contains more information about the public comment period how you can uh comment um I'll be showing again how to sign up for updates but if you are interested in receiving that notice um we do recommend that you sign up to get those updates for when that comes out because it is very important um we'll be having a public hearing on the DPO um back here in this area uh so likely in Moro County either here in bman or another um local community um we're we are right now anticipating that to be in August but that could change so again please do sign up for updates if you'd like to know more and then from there the the process will continue kind of based on the level of participation re receive and um the council schedule well um I will what the experts in the room give you really the details about the project itself but um just so we all know why we're here uh the Sunstone project is a proposed solar facility that would be um have up to 1.2 gwatt of generating capacity 7.2 gwatt hours of battery storage uh six collector substations and an interconnection substation uh up to four ownin buildings uh and um 9.5 miles of overhead transmission line and then I noticed that I didn't finish Ming on my slide and so I figured I might pop quiz you all but I I do have the answer it would be up to 55 miles of access roads and 58 miles of perimeter fencing um I think those are a lot of pieces um but one of the things that people are most interested in are kind of what is the the overall footprint of this and uh according to the application the facility would occupy up to 9,442 acres of efu land exclusive Farm use land within an approximately 10,900 60 Acre Site great um so as I I mentioned for that facility and all of its impacts we believe that we do currently have um adequate information for the council to make finings or imposed conditions on all applicable Council standards again we encourage all the members of the public to review um the the the complete application as well and let us know if you think we miss something or the applicant missed something um again we will be relying on the information in the application to draft findings and recommendations for the council",

        "text": " evolves is by having participation in the process of nominating board members and in the eim sense of the term that translates to a nominating committee that has representation of non-market participants on it so you know inclusion of of individuals or of of the industry that focus on issues like equity and making sure that customers the benefits of the rto for uh flow to customers would be an important addition so i'll i'll jump in after that um i i think there's actually a different way to approach it which is that it's not enough to just have diverse stakeholders participating if there's not actually decision making power for an organization or a community like the ones that verdi serves or for a tribal government then it's it's not meaningful participants uh participation but i'm really glad nicole that you mentioned governance because i think that is really where you can get to the heart of ensuring that benefits and burdens are are balanced i have a lot of concerns about the comment that there's no specific risks to underserved and low-income communities i think there are certainly risks with any market formation for for communities uh being undervalued uh spencer brought up the issue of um aggregating distributed energy resources that's something that we're certainly very interested in as we develop community benefiting projects having community ownership through like a renewable energy cooperative of a project that can then be sold in the market really increases the value of that project to the cooperative members and can build wealth in a community in a really meaningful way so ensuring that there are opportunities is one thing that could happen through a border governance structure and i'll talk a little bit more i think where the equity opportunities are there but that's one example of a benefit a burden again is just if you have expanded transmission um to accommodate uh regional needs and load or you have new market participants ensuring that there's some equity in the way they're engaging with the communities who are impacted by the infrastructure because i think the problem with an rto is a very high level regional organization and that loses the the on the ground community impact so you need some way to value that and i think that happens at the governance level by having two potential advisory that aren't just there to advise but also have some decision making power and i can't quite speak to what that would look like yet one would be like an equity advisory body that would be include members from communities who are transmission impacted um or are attempting to develop projects for for communities in impactful ways but aren't necessarily market entrants or utilities i think what nicole was saying about that piece is really important is that someone who's outside the interests of the system but may be impacted by the system the other important advisory body would be one that allows tribal governments who are part of our region but not necessarily participants in our power system but who are very impacted by transmission either positively or negatively and it does go both ways uh having some opportunity for tribal governments to have representatives and acknowledging that not all tribal governments can speak for other tribal governments that they're not a monolith but still having some avenue through which the sovereign nations that are in the northwest can have participation either to create new opportunities for their communities or to raise concerns about how a potential um rto or the actions of an rto or specific market participants in an rto are are impacting communities beyond that you can build in some requirements for an entity to be a market participant that they can't have projects that are disputed by tribes or communities or that kind of can go into the governance as well as ensuring that all participants are adhering by a set of equity principles and ensuring that the communities who are impacted by by the transmission system and impacted by our power system more broadly are either benefiting especially at the aggregated distributed energy resources level or um are not uh burdened uh at the higher level so sorry if that kept folks from break but did want to just jump in and share a little bit more about where i see equity opportunities and i think there are a lot here yeah no no apology that's great and uh we're well ahead of schedule so happy to have more discussion on this any other comments on oregon specific costs and benefits and um the feedback we we sort of summarized if not we we can take a break we're getting into question three hey hey adam this is frank i just you know in listening to nicole and ariana there's there's a lot of aspects to this that fall back on governance and you know it just it just points out to me that this will be one of the big areas of um and the difference between input influence and control across a multi-jurisdictional kind of area is going to be a big challenge in in an area that quite honestly has sort of been the wild west for a while so it's it i think if you look back at some of the history that's been a challenge on a number of different sort of approaches to to organizing the region and so i think it's a great opportunity to look at things like equity to look at how you handle reliability in market markets and other and you know the other things about it but it's it also places a pretty heavy burden on the development of the governance approach so i i just think that it's governance is going to be incredibly important it's also going to be an area of tension thank you frank i definitely see that um and so i appreciate it the challenge with some of these questions the the interrelatedness of all these issues certainly um but certainly governance um will be a major topic of conversation for us so with that let's take a break um so it's 2 37 why don't we come back at 2 50 at 10 of 3 so 13 minutes and we'll see you in a few minutes for question three thank you hey adam i'm gonna have to drop off a little bit before five like at 4 30. sorry about that we're we're running a little ahead of schedule so okay we'll see how long it goes if folks could turn their cameras back on at least temporarily so i can know you're back uh wait till we'll see a fair number of you before we get started see frank's moved outside to work on some lines it's good weather to do it that's true although the rain was nice i'm not quite to the top of the pole yet just give me a few more minutes a busy that's a busy uh busy poll there yeah it was visually interesting all right well i will go ahead and get us started back to our questions here question number three so i just also wanted to reiterate as we go through these some of the prompting questions i had up on the screen earlier just to think about um do you support or oppose perspectives that are represented uh would you emphasize something is there something missing so sort of the some key prompting questions are to think about so question number three is really focused on oregon retail um so certainly a lot of the studies and identify quantitative benefits from rto formation so this question was really trying to get more at how how those benefits could be how we could see through those benefits directly benefiting oregon's retail so some general feedback here again similar to the to the last most but not all commenters seem to generally agree with some of the major of the literature that rto formation can reduce overall costs um after accounting for the cost associated with rto administration and operation there was one comment that there's potential for there to be a delay in retail customers realizing that benefits from rto formation until after several years of operational experience uh partly there i think um associated startup costs cost versus model benefits this issue came up several times from different commenters one commenter contends that actual costs should be included to offset reported benefits which are difficult to measure because of the need to compare what operational decisions a utility may have made in a counter factual scenario where they not participate in an rto another commenter argued that projected future benefits should be weighed against the proposed cost to calculate the net benefits for oregon customers and multiple commenters identified the rate making principle of cost causation as being important to ensure an equitable distribution of an example of that given utility seeking to improve reliability or to interconnect new generations should be responsible for the associated transmission costs for doing so while minimizing the cost impacts to other so again i'll give the opportunity to pause here there's a lot of information on this one slide if i don't hear immediate feedback i'm happy to move on to the rest of the feedback to this question and we can take it all take it all at i don't know if it was the break adam or what but what were those prompts that you had at the beginning oh i um don't have in front of me at the moment do you support or oppose uh the the statements here would you emphasize something differently um and or what's missing so the what's missing could be very well on the next slide so that one's a bit tricky until i go through all of them yeah for the reminder so potential costs um so this was i i forget which of our commenters i know one of them uh kind of listed off some of the some of the costs associated with with rto formation so certainly institutional costs around uh starting up a market administrative and operational costs around the rto there may be technology costs associated with building or enhancing a market engine to model the new market market participants may need to make investments in meteorin upgrades and other equipment to interface with the allocation of costs for existing transmission and investments in new cost for market exports and out of market transactions and then potential benefits reduce net power costs rto can optimize transmission generation congestion reliability coordination while incorporating transmission constraints to dispatch generators on a least cost basis reduction in reserves data had market optimization by an rto can reduce the amount of generation needed to be online to maintain reserves for liability managing imbalances real-time lease costs dispatch to minimize the cost for handling lower cross integration of renewables can lower the cost of entry and open more opportunities for smaller scale projects to compete and types of benefits measuring both the tangible and the avoided cost benefits of rto formation and then we get to the the kind of the thrust of this question was around benefit flow through to retail customers multiple commenters contend that to ensure net benefits reach customers benefits should flow through power costs or other automatic cost recovery drop utility incentives the independent dispatch of resources by an rto effectively removes quality utilities",

        "text": " people in Salem Kaiser but they are texting me and asking that we speak more directly into the mic so um just to make sure everybody can hear us on Zoom if you guys can lean right into that hot mic Thank you new technology different settings so thanks for uh bearing with us and we'll take the feedback so it's today we kiss our mics with that I will transition over to reports and presentations I will I'll hand this part over to superintendent Castaneda to provide a brief overview of transition plan yes thank you so much I will be unable to be anything other than embarrassingly enthusiastic so for just this mating I'm just going to be that way I can't help it um I am so excited and honored and just downright privilege to be part of the Salem Kaiser community part of this body and also part of the Salem Kaiser Public Schools I am going to spend only a few minutes on the transition plan it's in your packet for board members it's available for the public on the website and I'll just offer two quick comments about it um the first that I want to offer is I do make the effort to share a few things about myself in it and I want to pull up one of those things now the entire reason that I do this work and the reason that it feels like a life passion is the opportunity to create like truly equitable and to dedicate yourself to the a lifetime of work of equity means taking the time to Define it for yourself which is a surprisingly challenging thing to and so I'll just share something you're going to hear me come back to this in various ways um many many times uh but for me a truly spectacularly and Equitable school system is one in which both Youth and adults have a recurring accessible opportunities to grow into their best and that means we have to see each other like really see each other and see the ways in which everyone around us is wonderful and is imperfect and needs help and has the opportunity to help we can create those schools and that is the reason that I love this job and am just so delighted to be here today I'll offer one more quick thing about the plan um and for anyone who chooses to read it and I will understand if that is very few people I will just say that I hope you feel my Earnest desire to really be a learner with you but still be urgent and be ready to jump right into action do everything we can to be part of this team and really contributing part of this community um so I think with that I will hand it back to you chairwoman so much uh superintendent gets on the other end we are delighted to have you uh here today as your first official board meeting is that so yes you just kind of move right along uh well the next piece is back to you superintendent to provide a brief overview of um this I believe we have the early literacy plan and legislation so to you and yeah this is just from there there's a little here it will be the briefest handoff on the way down to Deputy superintendent Olga cab um you also will hear the point of possibly being boring my utter enthusiasm and belief about literacy as our core work I just I I could not believe more than I that rich round flexible literacy in at least one language totally changes lives if you have that you can be a Creator in the world you can find your way you can learn new things that you have to have that and so that's both the responsibility that we have and also the gift we give to everyone in our schools and the details of our early literacy plan are ones that Olga will share the board's role in this is an important one because although tonight we're just getting an introduction soon we will be coming back to you because it from as a policy body it'll be your responsibility to take action on a framework and this is um our first real conversation about it so I'll hand it over to you Deputy superintendent copper thank you superintendent Castaneda Guzman Ortiz Vice chair Avila second Vice chair Carson Cunningham I wrote down all my new names I love it uh student advisors welcome we are happy to have you here uh superintendent Castaneda and board members we are very excited to bring you the very first pieces of information about this house bill 3198 that establishes a an expectation for school districts to have a comprehensive early literacy framework as you can can imagine districts already have done a lot of work around literacy in a lot of districts like Salem Kaiser have comprehensive literacy work that is being done by their curriculum departments but these really action around the state on some really specific requirements that um Center literacy in the partnership with families and I'll tell you a little bit more about that but it's a we are very excited about it because we have been doing a lot of work for the past two years in Salem Kaiser we have the foundations of the work and then we will come back this is the very first time that we'll share with you but we'll be coming back to you many times as we put together our framework and as we organize the work again it's a it's an effort to build coherence around the state and it's all around the governor's goals of improving student literacy we know that as a state we have to make some improvements and so this provides a framework and um in a in very specific steps that will get us to Improvement and then we will have some targets to report on those improvements our next slide please so the framework is built around these guiding principles and this first one is a recognition that language really starts at Birth and it starts with those stories uh it starts with the sounds that students hear that children here in their environment in their home in in that is really the foundation that oral language that oral practice starts from the moment they are born and starts building the background in which schools will build upon later the code of reading it also highlights that families and communities really strengthen these um this process um because they will deepen the opportunities for students to practice literacy and to access content with the communication that happens at home and the practices that we are going to engage parents in um also that districts there's an expectation that every teacher every district and I fully believe that that it happens in Salem Kaiser knows that every child has the ability to learn and that is our responsibility as the adults in front of them to figure out how is the best way to teach them how to read and write so they can access content through their lives also that foundational skills matter remember reading is a man-made code and we have to teach that code to children in an org in a in a specific order we have to help them understand that those sounds have a symbol that those symbols put together make words that words put together create sentences and that sentences together create stories and then they have to understand the code and they have to have meaning attached to that code for it to make sense and later for them to complete continue with comprehension increasing vocabulary and then keep applying these learning throughout their life so that they can be the Learners that we want them to be so we have um this is one of the pride points I feel that we have as a district we have been working on foundational skills for uh three or four years and uh continue to focus on these work remember I don't know if you remember we shared in this in this room that we have about 480 new teachers so every time we have a new teacher we make sure that that is a very important component of what they deeply understand so that they can help us um teach a child to read and write next every child must be taught to read and write no matter what it takes we will do everything we will have all the um appropriate resources the interventions we will look at data deeply so that we can make sure that every one of our students learns to read and write that something that we are very proud of and that we have been a participant on in the early conversations with ode around the framework is this value of multilingualism in that students don't come to us as Bland canvases they come to us with background with language any language and that that oral practice is what we will start working with to help them continue learning in their language and then learning English and be proficient in English so that they can access the opportunities we have for them here and then to do all this work well we have to continue increasing our knowledge for our Educators and then the practices that are happening inside our classroom so that we can just get better and better at these at the art of teaching reading and writing um then what's next so again today is just an introduction what we're doing at the district level is We are continuing um implementing the plan and elevating the critical components like foundational skills like oral practice uh some instructional strategies that that help students um one of them is called aurasi and it means that we are putting in kids Link in kids mouths the language that we want them to use in English when they are language Learners we have lots of great strategies that we use and that are research based and are proven to help us get our students to literacy into Proficiency in their language and in English especially in We are continuing to create professional development opportunities for our instructional staff and I have to tell you we just did an incredible June Institute where we had over 800 teachers Educators join us and we and this was our focus our Focus was foundational reading our Focus was oracy our Focus was multilingual Learners and then also math because that's another area that will come back here and tell you about um that we need to have an assessment system to make sure that what we're doing is making the impact that we expect to have that um we are making adjustments depending on what students need so that's another area of focus for us that we are keeping parents and Community engaged in that we have a cycle of feedback with family so that they understand what we're doing in the classroom and they also understand their role in this important effort of literacy and then of course the responsibility to come back and report to you on how we're doing a report on our students progress and then tell the community in which ways they can support us and then on the other side uh board first of all we're gonna bring you a literacy plan and we're going to explain it to you and tell you how",

        "text": " you can bake into the process under your rules i think will be necessary just given the utility environment that we're in and then um you know it's a it's a bit the wild west you know some pds and co-ops really vary in their involvement in in these sort of projects and so some of them are nimble and ready to go and some of them may be looking at this for the first time something like this for the first time so yeah just underlining and putting an exclamation point next to the these projects are going to need a lot of flexibility in the planning process most everything is feasible if you have persistence but it will take time thanks laurie do we have anyone else it looks like ray might have his hand up again yeah i read in there in the document uh some language regarding um odoe's ability to to recover the grant funds in some circumstances and i wonder if you could explain expand a little bit of what those types of circumstances might be and i can think of an example where a project a small project goes through the planning phase and all of the and the grant money is awarded only to start going into construction and then something happens that is completely out of control of the project that essentially makes the project non-financially viable or whatever and the project is cancelled before it gets constructed and so if money's already been spent how is the how is the entity the the applicant expected to then refund those monies back to odoe i'm just trying to understand how this would work thank you i'm happy to take this one if um if no one else wants to jump in the the claw back provision will be related to the requirements set out in the performance agreement and so your example of a planning grant so long as the planning that was proposed is completed there would be no clawback of funds even if the planning determines that the project is not feasible and if that project is feasible and they move into construction that is a whole new round of potential funding they could come back to the program for a construction grant in which case if the project was not completed the construction grant would not be paid or if there were prepayments that could be clawed back but there would be no clawback of planning funds related to the construction of a project there for the planning components only and that'll be reflected in the performance agreement and they'll be different potentially for each project because the performance agreement will be based on the essentially what is laid out in the application as the intention for the thank you thanks ray do you have any additional comments or anyone who would like to offer comments before we wrap it up or almost at an hour so we're again very thankful for everybody who's joined with us today i'm going to go ahead and put in the chat um the information to we have two more people that just raised their rights but i'll put up some information for people to submit written comments too judge you by friday um ryan um if we you are off mute this is ryan carey okay um i i just went i read the rules and i didn't see this anywhere in there but i just thought i'd make a comment i don't see if there's any restriction on a project developer starting to use its own monies to purchase equipment or even begin constructing a project even before a potential incentive is awarded but i just bring it up because the reef grant program has that catch to it where you can't even start on your project while you have an application in or you can't use the funding for that and i think that just given the timelines and you know like right now a transformer is a 50 week lead time um it i've just just to state that i i think that if a project wants to start spending money and they're hoping for an incentive but if they get it later there wouldn't be any restrictions on the use of that fund because they started building the project early it'd be nice to make sure that that's safe for them to do does anyone know the answer to that i've never heard us talk about that on starting the project so i don't think we have that okay thanks because a lot of us would be you know that have shovel ready projects pulling all the finances together and the the grant or the incentive from a program like this would be um super helpful but we may still try to build the project anyway and just we'd want to get going on that so thank you i don't know if wendy has thoughts on that for specific rule language but wendy do you have any any comments before i i have one one thought about it that i wanted to share but um well i think that certainly i need to look a little bit more detail at the bill with this question in mind just to um see what it says i i know just having worked a little bit with um some of the usda refunding um and i know that various programs with certainly usda and others have their own requirements on on this question so um we'll look at that pretty closely ryan thanks for bringing up the issue so um i think rob may have some experience with some previous odo programs such as the red grants and i don't know if that will inform part of what rob has to to say yeah i was going to bring up the previous programs and i think what you said wendy about scouring the bill a little more closely for a definitive answer is is right for this question but this program is a little different from previous programs where previous programs were kind of about market transformation and supporting a and this program is a little different in that it's really about kind of some supporting communities and it's it's a it's a subtle difference but it means that this this program doesn't have to demonstrate that it was the sole reason a project moves forward it's there just to support these community projects and that subtle difference may mean that you know projects can be in some some level of of construction throughout the process but like wendy said um we'll we'll have a closer look in the rules and or end of the statute well i think we we did also think a little bit as we were the rules that we could have a situation a community or one of the entities who's an applicant eligible applicant had installed solar pv already but we're looking to add storage to add resiliency and that that would be a situation where there's a project that's combining the two and so part of the project in a sense had happened earlier but then more equipment would be added to to the uh pro energy i guess what facility i'm not struggling for the right word here but the combination of solar and storage so um thank you for bringing that that question up ray and we will like rob said kind of scour the the bill and the rules more closely with that question in thank you okay next up is spencer meeks and spencer you are off mute uh gusher thank you can you hear me hey i had a probably pretty quick one and again happy to follow up outside this meeting too but i was curious to know if you have any thoughts about how you plan on structuring outreach to build awareness for these funds and this ongoing project given that the grants are going to be open uh it seems to be in the march time frame it seems to me like that would be uh something better to do sooner than later or is it that um you're beginning that outreach in march once these funds become available for applications really great question and i actually met spencer at the oregon solar energy conference and he was already thinking about outreach and shared some some good thoughts on this topic so we have been doing um the type of outreach that odo is kind of traditionally good at reaching out to utility managers reaching out to representatives from municipalities and counties but this is one area where we we need help and we've been working with the advisory committee to help kind of sort out how we get the outreach to the communities that most need it and are most traditionally underserved and so it's a work in we plan to have outreach running continuously throughout the entire program we want to start it as soon as possible and we i think we'll learn a lot from this first opportunity announcement to how we can get the word spread to the communities that most need it thank you thanks spencer one of the things that keeps me up at night spencer making sure we do a good job of that um so we did have a question in the comments from jeanes reyes who wanted to know if it was possible to provide captions and highlights from this meeting just so you know we'll have to do a public a hearing officer report as part of our rule making process wendy will pull that together and that's something that we'll publish online on the community renewable energy program rulemaking page i shared the link higher up in the comments but you can also easily find it on our website thanks for the question i don't see any of their hands up at this point no i don't either they do like to come up as soon as we say that though so so we'll give it another minute or two we're really glad to get all of this and close reading of of the rules especially when we have a new uh program like this and we're creating all brand new rules we really need to get a lot of eyes on them so just maybe a couple of quick reminders um i have a few closing remarks and if anybody else thinks of a comment in the meantime please go please raise your hand so we want to thank everybody for written testimony again will be accepted until the close of business 5 pm on friday january 28 2022 no other comments or exhibits will be accepted after this date unless odo decides to extend the public comment period excuse me for everyone uh we will review all comments and summarize them in the hearing officers the oregon department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding is in the the permanent rules and we plan to file the permanent rules in february next month and the rules will be effective upon filing and we will issue the first opportunity announcement shortly afterward and as robin mentioned our plans were to do that in march i don't i think ray had one more question about in the chat about um uh priorities and opportunity announcement i don't know if there's anything that you want to say about priorities and the opportunity and announcement um rob or christie anything that we would",

        "text": " plan okay thank you cool good thank you any questions or comments on fish and wildlife habitat um let's see council is threatening an endangered species standard this is pretty short based on the applicant's literature review that was confirmed reviewed and confirmed by odfnw and the oregon department of agriculture suitable habitat for state listed threatened and endangered species was not identified within the analysis therefore the department recommends that the standard is met and there are no conditions recommended underneath this this council have any questions no questions the scenic resources standard requires requires a finding of the visibility of proposed facility structures or vegetation loss and landscape alterations would not cause a significant adverse impact to scenic resources and values identified as significant or important in local land use plans tribal tribal management plans or federal management plans um here in the table provided uh is a list of some of the plans that were reviewed and the scenic resources that were um were a table rock uh area of critical environmental concern and two scenic byways in the evaluation in the proposed order the department recommends that council find the visual impacts from the landscape alteration and facility structures associated with construction and operation would not result in significant adverse impacts to these resources that were identified as significant or important um however the applicant does propose measures as i uh highlighted before under protected areas that would reduce um the visual impacts to scenic resources the department recommends these measures under scenic resources condition one um in which that facility structures like the o m building and substation would be used as uh earth tone colors or in a way that blends in the current landscape this would also apply to the battery storage enclosures that facility lighted be shielded and directed downward um to the minimum necessary for construction operations safety and security and this also uh you know applies to reducing potential visual impacts underneath the recreation standard as well as protected areas that's all i had on scenic resources the council's historic cultural archaeological resources standard under sub 1 of this standard the council must find that the construction operation of the facility taking into account mitigation are not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to historic cultural or archaeological resources that have been listed on or would likely be listed on the national register of historic places or the nrhp covers under council's um jurisdiction and review under the standard um for facilities on private lands uh it would cover archaeological objects um and archaeological sites as defined in shippo's statutes shippo is the oregon state historic preservation and under sea for a facility on public lands it would cover archaeological sites do you want to note that the facility site boundary includes that are privately owned and also there's a couple parcels that are owned by the oregon department of state lands or dsl under the standard the department recommends uh two conditions um which i will note on in my um in the applicant's desktop review and from the on-site pedestrian surveys that were conducted in collaboration with the klamath tribes the the applicant identified seven prehistoric sites treated as eligible for the nrhp 22 prehistoric sites treated as potentially eligible and and 69 prehistoric sites treated as not eligible for listing on the uh nrhp these preliminary recommendations were subsequently replaced to treat all of these sites and isolates as part of an archaeological district so uh uh there's archaeological sites which just are just kind of high level explaining it um we have uh archaeological sites which are made up of a grouping or related amount of archaeological objects or isolates but isolate is um you know kind of a smaller unrelated um archaeological potential archaeological resource on on the landscape so all of these um and were essentially treated as a archaeological district um that was an outcome of the work that the department did in with shippo and the applicant and the applicant's uh ongoing early and ongoing coordination with um the affected tribes which primarily included the klamath tribes and the burn pine burns caillou tribe aside from the above ground historic resources which there were a couple historic resources ultimately i believe schiphol concurred that they were not eligible on the nrhp um the archaeological resources identified in this district are all were all classified as prehistoric archaeological resources representing the ancestors of modern so that's so essentially they were all considered tribal resources so the result of coordination between the applicant chippo the klamath and burns paiute tribes and the department was a memorandum of agreement between chippewa and the applicant which was codified in this archaeological testing and excavation method methodologies plan which is attached as s1 to the proposed order um this plan defines archaeological testing and excavation which provide avoidance minimization monitor and monitoring for impacts to archaeological sites and mitigation measures to catalog archaeological and artifacts this plan was executed between the applicant and shippo um and reflects agreements that the applicant came to with the affected tribes um on that note we also and as footnoted to discuss further in the proposed order is that um the klamath tribes you know provided comment essentially that they um came to an agreement with the applicant um which is reflected in the avoidance areas monitoring and mitigation and that the standard in their opinion would be met the council standard um the applicant also proposes avoidance minimization mitigation and monitoring proposed uh that is outlined in a cultural mitigation and monitoring plan or cmmp this is included as attachment s3 to the proposed order the cmmp includes applicant represented measures again to avoid uh avoid impacts as um i pointed out in that if council has it in their mind's eye um of those avoidance areas of those dune areas that were um common for pygmy rabbits or where pygmy rabbit colonies were found these are also common areas where tribal ancestral resources um are were found or may be prevalent or so the cmmp uh has measures that avoid these resources and that also reduce uh to these prehistoric archaeological resources such as revising the facility layout to avoid impacts to sensitive areas as i as i noted um this also includes the inadvertent discovery plan which is um the or an idp inadvertent discovery plans are pretty typical in their structure and their content of what they lay out and provide um procedures and contacts uh that relate to sensitive resources and particularly if there's human remains that are found on site to verify that construction activities prior to enduring construction are conducted consistent with this archaeological testing and excavation methodologies plan and that the avoidance measures to around sensitive areas are completed um the department historic culture and archaeological resource condition one okay i'm gonna move still on historic but i'm gonna move on to the next one because this is interesting so as we noted right um as we noted there were these archaeological sites um and objects and subsequently the entire site is being treated as an archaeological but because the applicant intends to conduct work within an area of known archaeological objects and sites this is a you know a trigger or a box that's checked that requires um that archaeological permits that are issued by shippo um that those would need to be obtained now this is a state permit um that you know applies and could be within council's jurisdiction if the applicant requests it to be such uh and so obsidian uh solar requested that these shipping archaeological permits be included and governed by the site certificate so um uh so let me find my place here so uh through the application process the department and shippo and the applicant coordinated to get these applications for the permits completed um and and that that they were conducted in accordance to shippo's procedures which went out to um you know affected parties for comments and that that information was provided back and so um these permits uh also were attached to the draft proposed order for additional commenting on any of those conditions because functionally a permit and any conditions for a permit another state permit that's under the council's jurisdiction those conditions function as a site certificate condition so these permits are also attached to the proposed order now and because these permits are under council's jurisdiction um the effective date of these permits were normally if an uh a developer were just to get them directly with shippo when schiphol issued them they would have a date which begins their expiration process or for when they apply but because this is council's the dates and signatures are blank on those permits as attached to the proposed order and the dates will be filled in based on the date of the council final decision which is consistent with that general standard of review condition one so um so after final if there's affirmative those that would kind of be the start date with the whole intent that these permits are executed uh or dated signed and begin and then are go they go over to the applicant so that the applicant is conducting any ground disturbing consistent um with the the permits um and that is what i have for the historic culture and archaeological resources standard are there comments or uh miss starting weather this is perry chopte i hi councilmember truck too um i'd like to give the council a little bit of background on the area and um of the permitting process anytime that um a cultural site is going to be impacted by a project you have to apply for a permit through the state historical preservation office the area out there has a huge history with luther cressman 75 sets of sandals that average about 9 000 years a piece um at fort rock and then um just a short jaunt from there is the paisley cave um it's one of the oldest areas for dna evidence of man on the north and south american we work to work with them on cultural resource surveys out there and the dunes it is uh a prime place to uh bury our our deceased ancestors it um back in the day it was a lake and um as the lake started to recede 10 000 years ago um the only place where there were actual dirt to put our people in were those dunes and there are areas real close to the project area where the dunes are are part of our traditional burial grounds and so we worked with project proponent to identify these areas um it is very significant we worked with the university of oregon to do a surveys out there and to evaluate it for cultural resources and so um the area is very significant to several tribes warm springs burns and us and so um we spent a little time out there and it is a very very special place so thank you for the opportunity to give you a little bit of background on it thank you for sharing that perry informative absolutely the council's recreation standard evaluates the importance of recreational opportunities and is assessed based on five",

        "text": " $26.2 million and miscellaneous and annual reoccurring maintenance projects. With a cumulative budget of 23.9 million. This proposed budget is 22,347,569. And if the following changes are approved, which I'll go into here shortly, the revised budget would be 22,364,547. That results in a 3% decrease from last year's budget, which that decrease is equivalent to $694,189. And if you'll recall, last year, we did ask for more equipment to our yellow fleet, as well as our white, to try to make some improvements on that front. So, since submitting our budget and sitting here before you today, that I do have three items that I'm requesting to modify. The first would be to move 200,000 from the parts and vehicle equipment lot item to the repair and maintenance fleet management line item. So this is truly just a shifting money from one fund to another where we think that they are appropriately placed. When we prepared our budget early in the year, we assumed a 50 50 split because we weren't sure what those figures were just yet based on. What we're seeing now, that we believe it is appropriate just to prevent any kind of future budget adjustments, to go ahead and make that move. Now. We good with getting Audrey to go ahead and make that change? I think so. Second item that I'm requesting today is to reclassify a budget administrative coordinator to a OCE fiscal manager. This would be a base salary of 56,930, which would be equivalent to a $10,683 increase. And to go along with that, the second request to reclassify would be one administrative staff assistant to an administrative logistics manager. 930, that would be a $6,295 increase. And this is an effort for us to try to remain relevant with some of the other departments within Marion county. Hopefully, nothing out of the ordinary here. I think we should go ahead and make that shift. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Are there any other questions for the transportation fund? The TM fund? Yes, commissioner. That's on your. What is it, operating supplies? Yes, sir. It looks like it's significantly increasing. And then also your. Are you shifting money from the parts, vehicles and maintenance? That's correct. Yes, sir. And it is removing 200,000 from the one and then moving it to the maintenance. So instead of having 200,000 and parts and vehicle. Exactly, exactly. And then to your initial question, the operating supplies, I don't know what's on that. The biggest hit there is the wifi that needs to be installed over at OcE. So they have reached their life expectancy in coordination with it. The recommendation was to go ahead and make modifications there. That was a larger than usual hit that we didn't expect, but it was recommended. And also across the three buildings that we have over there. I can. I can speak to the Wi Fi. Isn't that great? So staff does get delayed from time to time due to that, Tom seems to be a real problem this year. Yes, sir. Thank you. Yes, sir. He's driving up everybody else's budget. Audrey, did you get all of that? Okay. Yes, ma'am. I'll move into the road construction fund. The 20% gas tax. This is cost center 403, page 253. Okay, so this is the account that we typically use for all the materials that Jared and his team need. Also our traffic group. Any materials that they need at signalized intersections, grates, chains, fencing, materials associated with dras. And we're not proposing any positions here since submitting this budget. And from us sitting here before you today, there's no proposed changes. Keep moving. Yes, ma'am. Nothing to storm water program. Call center 430, page 353. So this was actually established in 2022 in response to federal and state requirements to address those water qualities. And I spoke to the liaison's position previously. He assists with those as well. So you've got the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system permit, the NPDEs total maximum daily loads, tmDls, and the basin Management action plans be maps. These are some of those requirements that stem the creation of this particular group. We've got 13.02 positions in this budget. The proposed budget is 4,017,219. This is an 8% reduction from previous years, which equates to $361,173 in savings. I do expect that we'll have some project carryforward, so this. This will actually go up in the coming year, but we are moving to get some of those projects out the door quickly. One item to note that I do want to bring forward, we did include a professional services account for 60,000 here for a stormwater asset inventory assessment. So when I came on board, I noticed that based on my experience in Sumter county, there, there were a lot of times where we had some pipe failures and some of the more historic areas of the county that from time to time, we had just put new asphalt over. So that's one thing that we don't want to see happen. So my plan and what I'd like to do is one gauge where we are from an asset standpoint. Figure out what needs to be CCTV routinely and what those schedules look like. That'll help us also comply with some of those regulations that are coming through from the state to make sure that we're on top of that. And then where and when necessary, we can start lining those systems so we can prevent those kind of catastrophic failures. The cost savings on something like that is significant. So this would be a phase one, if you will, gauge where we are, come up with a plan of how to implement some sort of improvements in the future for lining or other repair methods before something catastrophic does occur. That was that timing. Are we going to be okay? Okay, go ahead. Yes, ma'am. So this budget is consistent with the sip that was provided to the board previously, and nothing in this particular budget item has changed since we initially submitted this. Very good. Okay, do we have any questions? You covered a lot. Yes, ma'am. In a short amount of time. Yes. Commissioner Kerr, I would just like to thank all of you, particularly Jared. I mean, we all get the same emails, you know, duplicates and so forth, but I mean, the response we get on behalf of our constituents, I mean, a lot of it is roadway potholes, traffic signals, you name it, we get it. But I mean, if it's Saturday, I'll beat on him a little bit. But anyway, thank you all. Commissioner hurry speaks for us all. Commissioner Salik. Jared, are you working to now with Tom in regards to the work order system? Will you be this next year? We are through our office a little bit. Certainly. Okay, well, don't let them get it wrong. Be your fault. Thanks, sir. You're welcome, sir. One other tracy, the program that you were looking at down at Lake Weir to move the water down there, is that like because of St. John's? Is that not on the table anymore? So commissioners, Stephen can actually speak to this. And before I let him do that, I did want to take a minute, though. You know, you saw some adjustments to your budget made here. While we were seated here, Steven came in while we were already in the throes of doing the budget. He's been with us since the beginning of January, and he immediately saw that there were gaps in just our historical work that we've been doing, some modernization to some things. And I do appreciate that fresh eye and the fresh attention that he's been able to give all of your programs over in engineering. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Stephen. He does have a new stormwater engineer, and they're actively involved on that project on Lake Weir? Yes, sir. So removing and replacing those culverts right there between Lake Weir and I think just south a little lake weir. So that that is nearing, I would venture to say it should be at 100% now. So there was a bit of a holdup with the permitting agency, and there was some back and forth on whether or not they were still going to do the, I believe it's the 404 program going off recollection here. Long story short, those permits are forthcoming. As soon as we do receive those permits and get the green light there, we're ready to advertise. So I would venture to say before the end of this fiscal year, we should have that project out for advertisement and just for the record, not little Lake Weir. It's the culverts on big Lake Weir that are between the mainland and Temaquan. Not anything to do with Little Lake Weir, just for the record, just to the canal system, I guess that connects just south of there. Any other questions? Well, again, thank you all. Thank you, Jared, for taken the emails that get forwarded your way and your responses that are extremely detailed. To answer them on behalf of all of us and for the whole team, thank you for what you do. And Doug, you carried double duty for a long time out there, and so thank you, Stephen. We're glad you're here. And, of course, our fiscal manager. We're very happy that you're over there. Thank you, guys. Thank you. That's going to take us to Robert Bomus, PPO director, and he'll pass out, I guess, some things for us. Thank you, sir. Thank you",

        "text": " involved um and and the right feedback um I think that there is a real concern around timing um you know I've definitely heard the uh the truism that you know we're building the the airplane as we're flying it but so one of the big goals today was for for us to hear from everybody about your concerns about how you'd like to see your concerns addressed um and so you know the executive board has seen the draft grading criteria so we could you know we could certainly go back to the board with you know asking that it be shared you know with the advisory committee or with or you know or with you know stakeholders at large um you know that's all on the table for what we discussed today um and that's why we're here today is because I I want to hear these concerns and we want to be able to ably represent you on the executive board I mean if they have um if they have draft criteria without even having convened the advisory committee it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in the process I um I definitely I definitely understand your concern with respect to convening the advisory uh my understanding that was a first communication was sent out to them and that the goal was trying to get a first meeting um in September which was what they had um and so you know or more communication so my understanding is that there will be more communication to the advisory committee uh this month so uh next week but in terms of whether or not that's going you know to an include at a first meeting I I'm not sure on that um okay so that was um the information that I had to share today as part of the presentation so we had on our agenda that this was going to go until for another uh 15 20 minutes and then I had a break a break built in there so I will ask uh of this of you guys right now would you like to take a five ten minute break or would you like to just jump right into the discussion I think you can just write break or no break into the chat and I'll make Jessica be mathy okay so far we're five people just want to jump right into discussion I don't have anybody that says break so I didn't even have to be mathy there's still time okay so these are the questions that I sent out as part of the agenda and again these are meant to be guiding discussion questions um but these don't have to be the only things that we talk about um just as a reminder the goal here um is to hear your questions your concerns and your suggestions and we can have you know you can tell those things to to Odo and business Oregon specifically but also discussed amongst all of us um so I've broken them down kind of and oops that one was wrong anyway the bottom header um is wrong it was just more how to use this opportunity so you know I think that will start with um a question that I I know that Ken's already got us started on which is you know what are your what questions or concerns do you have around the Pacific Northwest hydrogen Association its executive board or its advisory committee um though I already see a hand from Greg why don't you just jump in Greg yep I was just trying to get in the cube um on that particular issue um yeah I I share a lot of Ken's concerns I mean it feels like it hasn't been particularly transparent it feels like Oregon's kind of been an afterthought you know in a lot of ways it would have been nice if um Washington uh staff had been here today to talk with all of us about some of these issues instead of um you having to kind of be be uh you know providing the best information that you have because I know you've had challenges getting good answers as well you know it seems to me that there is a lot of process here which in some ways is good we need transparency we need a you know a good a good process that people can trust at the same time you know I think we're all expecting the doe foa to drop in the next let's say one to four weeks maybe um you know I I've heard plenty of different things some of them are conflicting so I don't know but it doesn't feel like a lot of time for advisory committees subcommittees you know consensus building all those kinds of things and I'm kind of wondering how they're going to take the information they're getting in their RFI that's due um and actually make decisions based on it in the time frame that a concept paper is due which as far as I know is anywhere from 30 to 60 days after um foa is dropped so it just feels like there is a lot of process that's good but also not a lot of clarity about how it's actually going to happen in the reality of timelines and so I think that's one concern um and another concern is just just that there actually be like a a real Oregon element to it you know not that like there's an organ sort of token participation that they you know throw in a a you know a little small electrolyzer somewhere or a very small element of a project somewhere but that they're actually like a legitimate you know sizable portion of the project that is in Oregon as well as Washington because they have said a couple times um they're very interested in a legitimately Regional project and I think that benefits them so those would be two things I would just highlight you know that there actually be like a legitimate organ element to it which is concerning for all the reasons that Ken has outlined too um and just kind of like reality of process here it feels like decisions are going to have to get made pretty quickly um and it's not clear how that's going to happen given all the kind of lack of clarity about these different groups thank you Greg Ken is that your hand up a new or is that an old hand it's a new it's a new I apologize but no lay it on me so you know most people on the call uh probably know that we have a pretty involved hydrogen Hub plan it's got a lot of attributes that we think are attractive to doe and and we didn't even design it that way we just designed it and that's how it turned out and I imagine other folks on this call have projects that that they're they're wanting included as part of The Proposal we certainly want ours included but how do we how do we make a decision not to separately propose our project to given the lack of involvement um and and we don't even know when we will know whether we're included or not included in the um Commerce departments effort to to put together a proposal where we have no input I want the criteria we have no feedback on what the criteria are going to be for the selection um I I mean we're we're wanting to be cooperative we want to be part of this process but kind of at every turn we're not uh and you know how how do we not assume we're gonna have to um put in a proposal separately and and we don't want to do that thank you other uh thoughts specifically related um the specific discussion about the transparency or lack thereof and the process Jed please go ahead oh Chad if you're speaking you're on okay I think if we could just think of it on a higher level for a minute you think of the competitiveness of a nationwide application and just uh the clout that comes from a regional application uh hopefully it doesn't become a such a competitive infighting between states or smaller projects but what's realistic to compete uh on a nationwide level I mean that's a idealistic but hopefully that message is is conveyed to all of the partners and able to put together a really uh concept plan that that competes on a national level thank you Jen that's a that's a great everybody or 76 people anyway think they have projects and that number I guess is probably going to go up um we've been pretty open about what our project is most folks are not very open about what their projects are if we're going to propose a regional hydrogen Hub to doe my thought has been and maybe somebody has a better idea I'm wanting to hear it my thought has been that we need to tie these projects whether it's 76 of them or a dozen of them or five of them or two of them we need to somehow take this Patchwork and put them together into some kind of coherent quilt that describes what the doe wants to see as a regional hydrogen Hub that can actually interconnect to other Regional hubs over time and this holding things close to our chest every project doing it the Commerce effort apparently doing it is just poison to that and and I I just we need openness or we need a different idea than the one I have in my head and I just don't know what that is thank you Rebecca can I get um Jet's hands up and I'm not sure if it was a an old hand up or if it's thank you Jessica I do see a handout from hi Rebecca uh thanks for going over this today this is renewable Northwest um I'm I'm just a little concerned about what the role of the advisory committee um I feel like it's much a much better kind of representation of you know Washington Oregon you know uh folks developing projects you know non-profits other entities rather than the executive board itself um and it seems like the advisory committee has been kind of uh their role has been kind of minimized or delayed the executive board was have started meeting since June or July I'm assuming and the advisory committee hasn't even met yet and I'm I'm not really sure of what uh role does the board or other organization itself see from the advisory committee and it seems like the project selection criteria timeline the like the concepts the technical Concepts all of this should be under the purview of the advisory committee where you know project developers and other entities can kind of discuss these in in an open Forum uh and we haven't even heard about when the first meeting is on the advisory committee so I'm just wondering if if it would do if it would be good to kind of push um or kind of have a word with the executive board on you know what it sees the role of the advisory committee as and uh you know get moving on that so I think that that would be my input uh on kind of having in creased role for the advisory committee and uh having like particular areas of uh input where advisory committee would be more kind of uh",

        "text": " we move into some key takeaways greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated to increase even with cleaner energy and vehicles as Salem's population grows as part of our deliverables for this project Italy does make a business as usual or BAU forecast of your emissions so what we do is we take into account um your utilities plans to decarbonize which are following your state mandates we look at your population growth and we add all of that together and what that does is it forecasts all of your emissions sector based out to a year we pay 2035 based on your climate goals with that we ran that analysis it actually shows a two percent decrease however I like to that's why we're putting this this this out here that your emissions are likely to increase even with cleaner energy in vehicles just because your population is set to grow so much so I would potentially focus on maybe more like vehicle mode um I'd focus on maybe like electrification uh sort of things like that and then to help support your utilities on their decarbonization as so if we move into our next Point residential commercial and Industrial energy use equates to more than half or 56 of Salem's total emissions so it's really important moving forward to build relationships with your commercial and Industrial sectors to see how we can help them decarbonize their plants and clean their own industrial processes when it comes to residential we have a few options that we can look at so we can look at electrification we can look at heat pumps we can look at Energy Efficiency like what kind of rebates or options or policies and programs can we support our residential homes and help those become cleaner and more optimized so of your total gross emissions 27 of your emissions are attributed to electricity generation 29 of your emissions are from stationary fuels natural gas propane and your other fuels as well so that includes like your distillate fuels the wood some of those like odd ones that are occurring um within your jurisdictional boundary and then a lot of this or most of it does come from natural gas however as the renewable natural gas comes online we're going to see that help but it's not going to be enough to help all of your emissions to reach your climate action goals however that's how we do these inventories is to Benchmark where we're at and see what we can do and where to best point our resources to actually help reach those climate action so local activity oh go ahead I have a kind of a question comment again so I kind of like how you you broke this up but um I just kind of want to make sure I'm understanding it so on the pie chart that we looked at the beginning we don't have to move back to that what I saw was the transportation is is definitely a plurality of uh the sector-based carbon emissions but when you combine um you know residential commercial and Industrial use here we're seeing that a majority uh is in fact that so I guess my my question comment is so would it actually be safe to say that like the physical uh place where we like live work is responsible for a majority of the sector-based uh greenhouse gases absolutely because when we look back at that pie chart that showed Transportation commercial industrial and Then followed by residential if we if we combine like we have the residential and the commercial industrial all of that stationary energy use including electricity is going to be the majority of your emissions okay thank you I don't mean to interrupt uh I mean I guess I am but I apologize so um when we say like uh elect electricity generated we're talking about you know probably like the power company whatever it is for that part of Salem like the electrical yeah okay and then fuels that includes the natural gas okay all right and then um I don't know if you guys are you know looking at the state changes um that are happening I mean I know that PGE has worked with state legislature to have some pretty robust goals is that kind of baked into the cake with these um calculations and it's baked in into our business business actual forecast which is like like so we're trying to make sure that all of the emissions reductions that we see that they have laid out in this plan we're able to translate that to the correct annual reduction value to appropriately show that in the business as usual forecast so when that's done it'll be provided to y'all as a memo and it'll show like the actual percent reduction so right now it's showing two percent it it could increase depending on how we look at when we look more at these numbers and how to actually get them correctly or more robustly so I got to paraphrase that to understand it um so the right now we're just taking what is steady state as as right now and it's we're not really able to project the changes that some of the State um rules have because they're they're still more in the beginning phase and not fully adopted um not quite so what it is is that just ickley is it doesn't have the ba forecast complete however when it is complete it will have those State mandates baked into it so I will be able to show those reductions on um from PGE from Salem from Northwest Naturals and like their decarbonization plans it will have those mandates baked in there it's just that we don't have it complete at this time to share it with y'all so it'll be there moving forward it's just not there yet correct absolutely okay now I understand of so local activities that increase Energy Efficiency and support the expansion of renewable energy will help reduce these emissions over time so because we are seeing that your residential commercial industrial sectors add in all together do equate to more than half of the inventory it's going to be important that we do look at cleaning your grid so we want to make sure all of our our buildings are as optimized and efficient as possible and then also just like look at renewable energy builds look at where you guys can put those where you can place them potentially how you can best optimize that for yourself or the City of Salem and then despite data differences mobile combustion your on-road continues to be a significant Source or 42 of your total emissions within Salem so with this one I would look at policies and programs that would potentially do like a Cash for Clunkers so trade in your internal combustion engines for an EV like an e like a rebate a rebate for those um look at your charging infrastructure and how best to place those as we we know that that can definitely help people feel a lot better about range anxiety they have app um a lot of access to your charging Networks and then there's many other ones that we can look at as well and I will say a really great piece of Clearpath is that we have this forecasting and planning wizard tool which allows you guys to identify what kind of policies and programs you're looking at enter those into a calculator it does ask for a lot of hyper localized information so it's going to be a heavier lift but once you have those calculators complete and you apply them to this business that's usual forecast that we're creating for you it'll actually help show you the different reductions of those actions if you were to implement them and then how best to move forward on a timeline and everything along those lines so I'd be happy to help with that and Heather and I will definitely chat about that as we get closer to wrapping this project out so that we can set you guys best up for success in modeling with your climate action plan hey Hannah uh we were having a conversation this morning about uh on-street parking and yeah or paid on street parking in our and there was some anecdotal uh uh uh uh conversation about the impacts the positive impacts but is there more science-based information that's available about the effects of going to paid on street parking I just I truthfully don't know all the numbers but I will say like that does help like congestion like all of that like paid parking everything along those lines it is showing like an actual reduction in emissions because a lot of people won't be taking their vehicles there they don't want to pay the money I don't have any sort of actual numbers to follow up with you on that I just had like some case studies so I can look in our um and we have it we call it our resource repository I can look and see if there's any case studies that we have documented that show like some actual reductions of placing that congestion pricing in if you guys would like that thanks it may be helpful yeah absolutely and that should be one that you can model as well in that forecasting and planning wizard so that should be it should be an option that you guys will be able to play with and within your BAU forecast as well and our last Point efforts that encourage alternative modes within the city limits of Transportation will be needed so we might look more at e-bikes we want to like more walkability maybe as you guys are continuing to grow and expand maybe you look more at like your Transit oriented development or we look more like a mixed-use kind of development where we have apartments on top and then all of your commercial space is on the bottom how do we really create like that mixed use um walkability that people are looking for to help them get to where they need but then also support a live a livelihood and then also just enjoyment of life through those areas as well so that might come through some code revisions that might come through looking at different contractor requirements sort of things like that but it's definitely something we can also explore in a further conversation if you guys are interested so one of the things that we're going to be considering this evening is a council motion regarding uh Vision zero which is a a program aimed at increasing and enhancing pedestrian safety within our community in other non-vehicular modes of transportation so I see a direct connection there between increasing pedestrian safety and bicycle safety within our community and and these these targets so I mean you're 100 as someone who does ride my bike I refuse to go on the highways because I'm terrified of cars so if I if I had more pedestrian safe areas to ride my bike I know that I would not be driving my 2012 Subaru around as much but if we move now so this is our last slide this is just kind of an overview of like just some principles for climate action it's critical to make sure that your reduction goals are progressive so Heather",

        "text": "ich. Yes sir, Mister Stover. Thank you, Larry Stover, then stonecrest. Today's first day. We've heard that our paths in the meadows may be completely eliminated. Am I understanding that correctly from our board of directors? This is a completely surprised us and very shocking. Let me start my statement. The primary purpose of the Meadows property is a stormwater retention area. As the surrounding area has no natural stormwater outlet, its previous secondary purpose was a little used nine hole, par three golf course that was operated as a loss to obtain a premium for the sale of adjoining lots. The original plan for the meadows included a swimming pool and pickleball courts. With closing of the golf course and the long delayed construction of the swimming pool some five years ago, the Meadows property has gradually evolved into a community park. In addition to the swimming pool attached cabinet with attached cabinet restrooms and parking lot, the meadows has over a mile of multipurpose paths, three fishing ponds and a pet walking area. Proposed conversion the frontage of property will be a property would be detrimental because it will screen the scenic view of the property for both adjoining and community residents. It will utilize the only developable area originally intended for recreational activities. It will adversely surround and thereby inhibit community use of the remaining property and create ongoing conflict by building a home next to a community pool. Development of the frontage of meadows community pool would be no more in the best interest of the 5000 stonecrest residents than developing the frontage of Tuscaloosa park or Fort King would be the interest of local area residents. Please preserve the intended use of the metals properties for stormwater management and community use and deny this rezoning as nothing has changed since it was denied two years ago. I hope you'll review the attached table that shows stonecrest may not have the required DRI open space requirement to allow the proposed conversion of 1.73 acres to open space housing. I don't have time to explain that, but I hope you'll look at the chart I provided. Thank you very much. Thank you sir. Yes, ma'am. My name's Marianne Scully Zushczyk. I live at 17404 Southeast 123rd Terrace on the house on the north side, right near the pool. The circled house in black on the photos I'm providing. Thank you. My husband and I bought our house in December of 23 and moved in about February of 24, so we're relatively new. Prior to this, we sold our house in Fort Lauderdale in 2018 and we traveled at our rv looking for a retirement home. We found stonecrest. What you're looking at is the sales video that was given that sold us on the house and the property itself, you see all the open green space. That's what we thought we were buying into. Obviously, we were shocked when we got the letter about rezoning. I was never told, but at first I was very upset about losing the view that we had. But then I start looking at all the people, all our neighbors that travel and walk those paths every day. They use the pool. It makes no sense. In all the developments that we looked at to put a house right next to a community pool, and their lanai would be right up against the pool pumps and the noise and everything. We're far enough away where we don't hear anything from the clubhouse, but a lot of people do gather there. So I'm very concerned. I mean, this was something, like I said, we just didn't know. And I really wish he'd consider not putting a house right there. Look at the paths. I see an old man pull up in a golf court with his dad. They get out with a walker, and they walk those paths, and they want to take him away. It's sad. A lot of people fish in that pond. And to put a loop around and take that spot near my house out makes absolutely no sense. Like I said, my husband and I looked at tons of retirement communities throughout the country. I'm a travel nurse, so when he retired, we just start traveling. And I just want you to really consider what I'm saying. It's just sadhesthe. Thank you. Before you go, mister. Zort. I don't know if I said it right. Michael Bottomley, if you'd like to come on up. Yes, sir. You're good to go. Yes, sir. Okay. Good afternoon, commissioners. I'm the reason why she's got the last name. She took hers normally, for everything else. Okay. Since living in south. Name and address again, I'm sorry. If you'll just state your name and address. Leonard Zuschik. Z u Z c h I k I live at 100 7404 Southeast 123rd Terrace in Summerfield. Thank you. Since living in south Florida since 1973 and growing up in New York in an east side tenement. Finding stonecrest for my golden years with his golf course, clubhouse, restaurant, and pond that at stock with bass that I fish at regularly, and a community pool adjacent to my property and a walking path that's a mile long. Where can I safely walk around? Because our houses have no streets, no sidewalks. Okay. I also have access in this community to Walmart and Lowe's, which I can get through by my golf course cart, but that's okay. These things made me, and I assume all their live in meadows and stonecrest happy, too. Adding homes to an area that was designated as stormwater runoff area to prevent flooding and the surrounding area and our area, too, makes me question why the validity of putting additional houses in this area. Being a new resident of Stonecrest only since February of this year and learning that adding houses to an area that was originally designated as green space in the original plans for the area when they were drawn up, trying to use new guidelines to make a few bucks. Now with this new construction and new passing of new regulations and to ruin, why I came to Stonecrest originally is not in the interest of the whole community. Just a few, in my opinion, is not right. I ask you to say no to the addition of these five homes. Thank you. After Mister Bottomley speaks, we'll have Ken Paulus. Mister Bottomley. My name is Michael Bottomley. I live at 17415 Southeast 123rd Terrace. Yeah, that's me. It's important to recognize that the meadows was never a functioning golf course. It's nine hole, par three was used very little as a golf course, and it actually had greens that were only played a few by a few members who occasionally used it to warm up our practice court. As stonecrest has no sidewalks, the metal property with its mile of concrete path has been used for the safety of the community to walk and biking, and I have dogs, and that's where I run when cars come at me. The planning and zoning commission members compared this to the closing of the Rainbow Springs golf course, and one member commented that it was a shame the former golf course hasn't been converted into another use. It's incorrect to consider this conversion of a golf course space to housing. It's always been used as community green space, and converting the frontage to houses would destroy the view of the metal residents have of the green space and the wildlife as well, and the other residents who enjoy seeing and using the space. Please deny this rezoning. It is not in the best interest of the stonecrest residents. Thank you, Mister bottomley. Behind Mister Paulus, we'll have Roger, who lives on southeast 108th Terrace. Thank you. Go ahead, Mister Paulus. Good afternoon. My name is Catton Paulus. I was right at 17513 Southeast 121st Circle, Stonecrest. At the March 25 planning the zoning commission meeting, the former POA board president was the chief sponsor of promoting the minnows proposition. He stated that his board negotiated a deal with Mister Black because the Meadows property was becoming an abandoned weed patch and something had to be done to correct the situation. In fact of the matter is that the meadows property was never abandoned as a Poa was required by the water management district by permit to maintain it, and a deal had already been worked out for the mowing of the property. The real purpose of the deal was to provide a way for the owner to divest himself of a defunct golf course with virtually no commercial value in order to reduce his overhead costs for operating the 18 hole golf course and a way to obtain additional revenue through the sale of lots. However, the 18 hole golf course has since been sold to another group, and now the proposition will only benefit the owner at the expense of converting green space and hiding the remainder behind surrounding homes. You have in your hands a copy of the letter sent by Mister Black dated April 3, asking the board of commissioners to approve the rezoning application without any conditions for pathway continuance. Mister Black appealed up for the county board to approve his rezoning application as rejecting the staff and planning and zoning board recommendation at the March 25 hearing, where there was a condition that the cart path entrance would be replaced and dead ends to be reconnected, where they would otherwise terminate at the new housing lot lines before a building permit is issued. David Black does not intend to do this. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mister Paulas. After Roger. We have James Hackle. Yes, sir. Roger Niellis. Seventeen zero seven five, southeast, 108th Terrace and Summerfield. I'm here to ask you to approve the rezoning of that small acreage that we are talking about here today in the Meadows property. The approvals needed to complete the understanding between the stonecrest community and sun golf. Over",

        "text": " existing generation fleet in pursuit of achieving the system-wide 2030 and 2040 reduction targets now again those targets are mandated and we will accomplish them irrespective of what fsec does at its rules because the the the guiding hand here is through the puc and through dq so we believe the legislature's intent for us and for fsec was to be creative in how to utilize our existing plants which may a modest increase at one site but a decrease in overall system emissions as we continue to evolve our generation mix we have submitted suggested language interwritten comments that we believe is consistent with the legislature's intent to spur innovation while continuing to reduce carbon emissions in our sector we're happy to answer any questions the council may have about our proposed language and thank you for the time to speak mr mccarthy do any members of the council have questions okay um thank you so much thank you um i do not see any other raised hands on my screen can i just get verbal confirmation from nancy okay great mr stevens if you'd like to provide your comments that would be a great time all right well thank you that was a shorter weight than i was hoping for but um thank you uh council and the staff appreciate your comments and your efforts on this i'll echo one more of kathy's comments that i think you know procedurally and in the spirit of the good work that you're trying to do there um was on point uh there being an opportunity for follow-on comment from other parties i think is a really good idea sort of generally procedurally as in an ideal world we might listen and uh to each other and learn things and or parties might come to a consensus or explore solutions that might be acceptable and have the opportunity to follow on with further written comments based on what they heard from the other parties um if they learned something new and useful or alarming or um you know however so i definitely support um kathy's comments about there being an opportunity to submit further written comments after these oral and other all the written comments come in before hearing in general in terms of the proposed rules um specifically on i think as relates one the issue that pge raised and two the just the overall edits the natural gas plants um on the one i guess we disagree with pge's presentation of the approach and the changes there if i having read the letter uh that was filed and heard the reason the comments just then it sounds a lot like we're gonna try to do creative things but our emissions may still go up um and they kind of you know in the context of multiple multi hundred megawatt and so forth gas plants that are available there really shouldn't be any universe and route to zero percent by 2040 at which those plants uh annual emissions are not radically being reduced and i don't think there's any world in which uh innervations and creativity of whatever sort should push that upward if they're running substantially less and emitting uh they should be emitting substantially less uh even if maybe per unit increments could go up slightly or or overall but um we would reject recommend rejecting that approach um and making sure that any permit extensions that are applied for are in the context of absolutely leading to the compliance with the 2040 requirements perhaps with some exceptions for emergent system emergency conditions etc so that you know unique traumatic events to the grid they could be available but overall that should be sort of on a radically declining curve not hypothetically increasing due to creativity um and that should perform the backdrop of that analysis and the modifications the rules second and sort of segwaying off of that um however and and you know nissan energy sorry for the record is is uh or um commenting on our behalf and you know we do believe that the um the current thermal units which exist um as billions of dollars of installed generating capacity probably do have a useful role in facilitating the successful decarbonization um and thus you know encouraging and facilitating the the decline uh compliant with those curves and the continual progress requirements under hp 2021 um you know should be something that can be facilitated and considered in a permit extension but also recognizing that there will be thermal units that may be intended to be non-fossil units such as a whole you know green hydrogen plant or a biodiesel reciprocating engine or a variety of units like that which would be greenhouse gas free but which could provide pretty substantial benefits to the world the market ratepayers and avoiding blackouts and reliability having an exception uh of some sort of de minimis threshold which provides that thermal plants may exist and if they if they did consume some sort of minor amount of natural gas in system emergency conditions or under some threshold you know plant ran one day a year or five days every five years or something like that some discrete number that would be permitted so that those units if there were other fuel shortage issues like the amount of biodiesel available um or you know constraints in the hydrogen storage or renewable gas etc that those units could still protect us from multi-billion dollar blackout type events like if that happened in texas and california um and that those de minimis thresholds could be allowed and be compliant with hp 2021 which while it does prohibit um the permitting of new fossil power plants those would not be fossil power plants but merely like hospitals and data centers and other things have backups essentially available for discrete highly limited events and that that would be worth considering as the rules are finalized happy to answer any questions mr stevens do any members of the council have questions c9 um and not seeing any other hands i will go ahead and recess the hearing on the 2022 carbon standards rulemaking uh thank you everybody for providing your comments um next up we have the protected areas scenic resources and recreation standards rule making i'm sorry before i move on to this i see that i have a a hand raised from a call-in user with a 8-9-0 number did you have a comment on the carbon center we're making thank you i do thank you and i apologize i i thought i'd raise my hand but i'm on the phone too so it's a little a backwards uh technology-wise so thank my name is dan sears i'm the conservation director for columbia river and we submitted um more detailed written comments uh on behalf of columbia riverkeeper verde rogue climate earthjustice and friends of the columbia river gorge i'll just highlight a couple of the main points and i'll be brief and again thank you for for catching me here at the end first of all we support the proposal to increase the monetary offset rate by the full amount currently allowed under organ law which is 50 we also support staff recommendation to reset emission standards based on the most efficient stand-alone combined cycle combustion turbine gas-fired energy facility that is commercially demonstrated and operating in the united by updating the offset rate the opposite offset rate and efficiency expectation for gas plants fsec is moving the ball forward in meeting the standards set by governors the governor's executive order 2004 there are a few issues where we'd like to see changes and i'll take the issue of significant significance first we urge efsec to reconsider the proposed approach to the question of what constitutes a significant increase in pollution hb 22 20 hb 2021 intended to prevent significant increases in carbon emissions from polluting fracked gas plants which are already the largest emitters in oregon aspects approach exempts from the requirement to obtain a site certificate an electric generation facility increasing its fuel consumption by more than 10 percent or by sorry by no more than 10 percent so a 10 increase in a gas plant using 100 million cubic feet per day for instance we think should be deemed significant for example 10 million cubic feet per day is more than all the residential gas usage in many oregon cities so again to ensure compliance with hb 2021 and governor brown's executive order 2004 asex should go further and clarify the clarify and define the meaning of significant in the specific context of gas plants to include additional thresholds beyond just the uniform 10 any increase in fracked gas use is significant given the clear direction by governor brown and executive order 2004 to limit new emissions plus the requirements of hp 2021 to avoid additional emissions from new or existing gas plants and kind of going along with this argument we just reiterate that gas plants do more damage to the atmosphere than what is just caused by the emissions of the plant itself wells pipelines compressors all release greenhouse gases in the atmosphere three to nine percent of a power plant's gas demand could be released to the atmosphere including emissions from these upstream pipelines compression compressors and wells as well as methane emissions from the gas plant further as we described in our in our previously mentioned written comments the reliability of carbon capture and sequestration remains in proven in oregon and elsewhere and so the idea that these fossil plants could be uh is one we would ask epsec to to really deeply question given the the unproven track record of carbon capture and sequestration over the very long timelines that would be required for them to durably remove or prevent carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere thank you for your patience and thank you for holding this hearing so serious any uh questions from the thank you again okay so with that i will once again recess the uh hearing on the 2022 uh carbon standards update and implementation of 2020 hp 2021 and i will move to the protected area scenic resources and recreation standards rulemaking hearing um before i open the florida commons once again i have just a quick background on procedural history and an overview of the proposed rules so as the council knows uh the council must adopt standards for the sighting of energy facilities including standards to address areas designated protection by the state or federal impacts of the facility on recreation scenic and aesthetic values and the council has done so under the protected areas standard the recreation standard and the uh scenic resources standard um the protected areas and scenic resources standards were last updated in 2007 the recreation standard was last updated in 2002 we began this rule making project in i believe 2018 to address issues related to the three standards and the associated information requirements and other rules that are associated with the standards the objectives were",

        "text": " here to the next change out all your your heating systems to to like heat pumps or something because we we know that that's not how it works you know people people have a heating system and eventually that heating system gets old and then it needs to be replaced and so we we tell uh the model what the share what the marginal Shares are what the new Shares are supposed to look like so at the end of that life it's either you know it can be anything we tell it to but it doesn't just change over the next day so um so that delay is important to understand when we're creating those parameters and we've taken we've looked at that before so the model has been calibrated to match it as best we can the state of Oregon in 2019 and the calibrations process is where we look at all the various data sources within the state so state level is obviously our first choice then it would be region then it's Federal and if we can't find any federal sources then we go kind of outside of that kind of best practices any anything International or things like that but most of our sources are are kind of are Oregon or definitely U.S specific and so what we do there is at first obviously the model doesn't know anything about what Oregon is or or what's happening there and so you know you populate the model with some kind of initial inputs and then you tune that so you you know you adjust the intensities within that model until your your modeled outputs match your observed your observed data so we're so we're so things like for example energy used in the or electricity use in the in the residential sector so we we tune the model we tune the energy use intensities of those buildings we tune uh the the mix of you know heating or fuel share so how much electricity is used for heating for example versus natural gas is used for heating and so we tune those Based on data that's you know relevant to Oregon until we until we match the observed amount of electricity use in the in that stock and we do that for all all the different fuels and all the different areas and sectors of the model so that um we're matching the the energy use and the emissions generated uh in the state uh and then that allows us to say you know at this point in time we're you know representing Oregon as best we can in a fair amount of certainty and then jumping off from there this the simulation period lets us take those same levers and turn them to uh explore different Pathways uh uh based on you know the parameters or based on what we explore want to see so that's where we tune those and then we turn these outside of balance to say oh what happens if we do this what happens if we do that what are the possibilities and and what are the outcomes of of exploring that and the main data sources that we use for this calibration and and generally for I guess the businesses plan part of it as well um yeah you can see we use various like U.S census um Nia uh seds which is uh an energy data database um for the emissions inventory we use deq's emissions inventory so so again we're tuning the tuning the model so that the emissions coming out of the model and 2019 matched with DEQ was um and then also too we had many many uh meetings with with you all at the commission as well as different various agencies uh within the state to understand you know what the state of what the state is in 2019 but also understanding you know the different policies and regulations that were adopted and underdevelopment for the development of the of the base the the um the reference scenarios so the business as usual or the what we generally call the business as usual or business is planned but you know using a little bit of different terminal biology in this case um so yeah maybe I'll pause for any questions about kind of uh I know you probably want to get into the you know the actions and stuff like that but any questions around the kind of the model itself and the model structure and the kind of that kind of context or the calibration that that anybody wants to bring up before I kind of move on Chris I don't see any hands rights oh okay yes Pat De La Croix just a Pat you're unmuted great uh can you hear me yes I can great um this is Pat de laquille with the Metro climate action team um how does the the um as I understand it the model works on annual energy flows what are the time periods that you use or the annual time periods or something else and how do you deal with your Peak demands I mean I have a lot of experience with time modeling and you know we divide the year up to into maybe 12 or 16 fragments maybe four seasons and three times a day and each load has a a you know a duration curve so we can keep track of peak load so when we optimize on annual energy flows the constraint is there that we have to meet the peak depending upon how much Reserve margin the um the you know you want to input into the model so how do you deal with your um how do you deal with this issue of peak problem Peak demand yep thanks for the question yeah so it is this is an annual uh model or the one we're using right now um and it is every year from 2019 all the way up to 2050. so as part of this project we haven't been tasked to explore kind of the the peak or the the daily loads uh that these these scenarios would would uh would generate but um we can and we we have before and we can apply you know 8760 uh load curves to the model at various years to look at the implications of of of the of those actions great thank you any other questions looks like Mary has her hand up great thanks Gary hi um thank you for presenting that I was just curious um I see that to get natural gas electricity and other fuel uses you used um one data set and I was curious why this was chosen over you know things like EPA reported data or um you know other sources just so we can understand why this is the the resource said Source a lot there fast you want to jump in for that one yeah I I don't know why we chose this one in particular I mean this is the sets had natural gas electricity and all other fuels uh specific for Oregon and so um it was a a One-Stop shop complete data set for for the energy consumptions in in Oregon and so um that's the data we used as in our assumptions and so we've calibrated the model to uh to meet uh these these energy consumption numbers so it was a it was a simplifying because it was all in one place was the I just didn't know if it was you know part of the model was to get a certain data set or if this is just the input so thank you that that helps this is just an input to the model yeah right so I don't know how different EPA data set would be in terms of if you would look at any electricity use from the EPA for Oregon would that be very different from the the electricity use that sets I am not as familiar with sides I'm more familiar with our reported the reported data goes to EPA so that was why you can look into uh yeah we can look into if they are different and I mean it would be a good question why they would be different but um but but presumably they are the same and in that case basically and yeah then it doesn't really matter which data set we use but yeah yeah we're not tied to any specific data set it's kind of like what's the best of it that we can find and and available that's a great question we'll we'll do a little homework on that all right long pause to make sure uh everybody has a chance to think about a question so um okay obviously you know if we want to Circle back feel feel free you know no it's just because we're moving on doesn't mean we uh we can't come back to it so but I wanted to pause just so we're not I'm not speaking too much right so the next kind of phase is is uh gonna kind of look at the modeling and again you've you know these are all the graphs that you that you've seen seen previously again just kind of going over refresh your memory um go over them really kind of quickly um and we can always come back to them if anybody has any questions um but the the kind of the process that we went to to get to this point was uh so there's the identification phase so so what what actions you know what policies did we want to explore and if you all remember we've had it we had took a couple meanings to to kind of go through that action list uh line by line and set the parameters and the what's in what's out um and the second phase was kind of looking at what the relative impact of each of those actions are what is our best guess of of the impact that those actions are going to be because we definitely want to focus on at impacts that or actions that or policies that you know did did the most bang for our buck and maybe uh you know with her limited time and resources maybe not uh not look at the ones that are kind of smaller smaller uh in scale so there was some actions that we left on The Cutting Room floor and we do have a record of all of all of those actions that we explored so and I think I believe you've seen you've seen them all already and and they're uh pretty sure they're posted somewhere uh but we could definitely make sure that they are um and then the third phase was kind of setting the parameters and again we you know through the with the commission we went through that process of uh of you know is this an appropriate level of retrofitting is this an appropriate level of uh heating system adoption is this an appropriate level of of uh you know whatever and so we did that with the commission with the various agencies with some of the uh different Utility Partners here as well had input into those actions uh and and those parameters and then the fourth stage that was kind of bringing those together and defining some scenarios so you know which taking all those actions and policies and kind of grouping them together into a scenario and we started off with with three and then",

        "text": " the issue so under this recommended organizational expertise condition one where we say hey you guys do your you know inspections and reporting but we do actually have them um right so here like including days inspections issues identified and any corrective actions taken we we asked for that information really if there was going to be something that was like flagged by again that's what's the question is that included here it strikes me as it would be odd that we include it here um substantiating organizational expertise but we don't we don't have times where that continues after the fact and that's a third-party audit so if it if it's included in this condition that's that's fine it's just not made clear again so yeah but the record talking i mean substantively it is so do they have quite a whack on it no they do not and i don't think we want to put that in there but did that provide the same substantive information yes so that's that's all we care about we don't necessarily care about the web you know audit or any of these other ones we care about the information that's being requested in here wherever that may come from whether it's an independent you know unrelated to these other audits that are being done by these other organizations or just simply their own you know maintenance crew going out there doing these evaluations that's that's the information that we're interested in and i guess if i want to offer as well if the wek a three-year you know report that's done to maintain if nerd standards are being met right because whack is actually not a reagan right not a regulatory agency nur are the standards the council actually has its own condition which was a mandatory condition that we kind of we house and it lives down in that siding standards for transmission line that says hey you gotta construct and operate your transmission lines to nerve standards so functionally we get we kind of get to the same place but we don't you know so right i think great thank you okay so i think that this is interesting i know it's not really intended for you to be able to read that in detail we can't really see it here in the room but under division 21 um it does say if the applicant is using mitigation um to meet a council standard which yes this applicant is then it says will tell us about your mitigation project so um so idaho power discusses in the application and we kind of summarize in the proposed order um so idaho power owns 17 hydroelectric facilities that uh several of these are under ferc licenses and which require um lots of different type of mitigation so one of them is that they have a riparian habitat acquisition plan um and a wetland plan for a 360 acre wetland rehabilitation property they also have a visual resource management um and so this is resource protection mitigation and enhancement measures um for for visual impacts for resources and then they have a historic properties management plan this is an hp and that's associated with um cultural resources tribal consultation and impacts for cultural resources and then in the application i'm not sure what the staffing is to today but just looking at the application but idaho power themselves as as the company they have you know a hundred percent called natural resource division um committed to people that work on um drafting mitigation plans compliance with it so they have this whole mitigation program so i'd say um that they actually have quite a bit of experience in mitigation projects um and and then which is that's there's um as council here there is a whole bunch of different types of mitigation plans that we're going to go over in the next couple months which gets us to our poll of structure changes to findings or conditions or is everybody comfortable with what's in the organizational expertise okay i guess we're ready for the shop haul okay cow yes and buyer yes and the jenkins yes thank you thank you it's doing great um we're we are getting there um i this is council's waste minimization um it's shocking it didn't get end up in the contestant case it's not usually the most controversial standard it's very to me straightforward the applicants must demonstrate but that they can um you know reduce and and minimize and recycle um waste generated during construction and operation of the facility to the maximum extent um i have a table here um that uh this is i consolidated this in a stack report in the proposed order i believe we broke this out by county um of like waste generated construction of the facility and it is it's quite a bit of uh waste generated so these i added these totals together in the parentheses is tons non-furnaces on the left are cubic yards and then so we have like kind of three categories one is vegetation so as you think about as you're going through with the roads right away of clearing you're going to generate quite a significant amount of vegetation native material or you're going to be your your top soil bedrock on soil ground clearing activities ground skimming activities and then solid waste is usually like construction waste so you have wood pallets cardboard wrapping those types of materials that facility components may be delivered and equipment may be delivered in um so i like this statement because we're we talk about how much is going to be generated of each type and what's going to be recycled and then what actually is going to to a landfill um so i think that that is helpful and informative and then my next couple slides don't worry i'm not going to read it i'm not going to read it to you um this is really kind of this is like the most important condition under the waste minimization standard and it's that the applicant um develops and finalizes a waste management plan like a construction waste management plan and so and so what are we asking they're like how identify what kind of waste you're going to generate are you going to separate it how and where are you going to recycle it ultimately where are you going to be disposing of it and that has to be in a licensed facility um so these are some of the the aspects that would be required in the in the waste management plan um and then the second part of this that's a long condition um sometimes the department sometimes we put these things in like a separate document and then um say you know and call it a plan or draft plan and then have a condition that says finalize it this condition happens to just kind of be one of those longer ones so the second part of it is um morrow county has a solid waste management ordinance and so we kind of um that those requirements because they really are directly related with how how are your loads transported where are they taken to how do they get there that's part of moral county's ordinance and so that's where this lives and then the last part of this is a requirement the plan be implemented during construction and then and here we go and the you know implementation and must be included in the six months construction report so there's another one of those things that's going to appear like tell us how your how your waste okay and that's okay so pick it up so all good ready for straw polling on this one thank you very much can i answer the questions yeah do they'll waste falling standards of fine and public services as well because i want to make sure that model attorney wanted the rights right double check well it's actually an interesting question because as i mentioned there's like this this nexus and overlapping so the council does have a public services standard and it asks the the evaluation of potential impacts to public and private service providers and there is a waste in their solid waste and so underneath the scope of that which i didn't include in this presentation i think i had it in my mind at some point in time but we do talk about the landfills where ultimately these want to go to but this ordinance is actually from moore county like the the view like the lens that we look at is more of the focus of it right is this going to really impact their ability to maintain and provide disposal sites and capability for their you know just whereas the the lens under waste minimization is hey will you just take measures to reduce and recycle the waste um but we kind of in our orders we're like then this is what we said here this is what we said here so you know they are kind of interrelated thank you yeah that's a good question just connecting the dots you're doing great okay so now we're kind of jumping down um and in the proposed order we're on page 605 this is citing standards for transmission lines um our proposed facilities transmission line that's standard applies um and kind of the the part i'm going to focus on on these standards as this first part that the applicant can design construct and operate uh the transmission lines where the alternating current electric fields do not exceed this this is the nine kilovolt per meter at one meter above the ground areas accessible to the public um so that's kind of that that's the threshold that we're looking at here so uh the applicant to do the modeling so right this is one of these um the standards that we're modeling right because we know that we're going to have some new transmission line but we know that we're also co-locating some transmission lines and then doing some rebuild of transmission lines and it's one of these standards where the proximity to existing transmission lines may impact um the uh um also the type the kv the voltage the structure type the spacing all of these aspects may uh impact the output and and final result so those are all those items that i listed or are inputs into their modeling and they used um oh it's an emf workstation uh but it's it's a model developed by the electric power research institute which also uses a methodology developed by the bpa to calculate these electric fields which are measured in the kilovolts per meter one of the items that they include in the modeling as a minimum ground as well so and then there's uh similar with a lot of council standards we're looking at like um worst case scenarios right so there's scenarios that transmission lines can operate in of like you know even if it's a 500 kv transmission line um they could you know like you could put 550 kb through there um that's not a normal operating situation but then do you say we do that with during our hot summer months and you could actually have some impacts with that transmission line where there is transmission like sag um and so so these are kind of contemplated in the so the table here is a little bit small but we'll go to that third column",

        "text": " just to give us the ability to ascertain how many there could be and make sure that we allot plenty of time for that at the end of today's meeting so I will just give a couple of moments if the public wants to if members of the public want to give us a heads up and I also wanted to say that uh inside of WebEx the um if you wanted to do a raise hand to let us know that you would enter star three and I hope I'm getting the instructions from Patricia correct you can continue to do that as we move into the next round and I'm sure Patricia will update uh me and the uh and our in our chat um if there are going to be some extended questions uh and for now uh I would like as we move forward I would like the advisory uh committee members if you would please go ahead and turn your cameras on as I forewarned earlier I would like to uh be able to have a different kind of an interaction today a little bit more maybe like an in-person uh discussion as best we can with the technology and I am going to go ahead and turn off the presentation momentarily uh during that discussion and then we'll come back to the presentation after the discussion thanks everyone for uh like honoring this turning your this was my idea so let's see how it goes I was like we've had a lot of we've had a lot of times where we haven't gotten a lot of conversation going with this crew we really really want to hear from you so thank you for trying this and let's see let's see what great ideas you all have and good questions you have so thank you and thank you all um and just real quick before we get going uh for the public uh audience on today's call I just wanted to share uh two of the main responsibilities uh of the advisory committee is that they provide the program uh or that they provide to the program as one is supporting Statewide community outreach efforts to help inform potential applicants about the grants and another is supporting each round's application review process by recommending uh and or serving on the external application Review Committee or what we call our value our competitive evaluation committee uh and in advance of today's meeting we sent the committee members a request to help identify and plan additional Outreach initiatives including how we can support and or lead those efforts and finally uh to ask their recommendations uh for external reviewers for the upcoming second round of the opportunity announcements uh so to start today's discussion uh I think we sent some emails with some preparing some Advanced questions for this but would like to ask the committee members are there any groups or organizations of potential applicants that were missed with round one's Outreach efforts and if so let us know and and we can move into that do we have the list available to share with people of who we did the webinars with I could kind of rattle off what I remember clay might have uh clay might have that list in front but you're uh your microphone is off click I can while you're seeing what we have I can um just kind of since we're asking folks for feedback and kind of what we missed I can at least share kind of what we did for round one in our um kind of trained to build off of um we did webinars with the association of Oregon counties the league of Oregon cities we did webinars with aqua which is like Association of Clean Water agencies I think definitely one of the better acronyms in in the state um we also did one with um the community colleges and the Special Districts Association of Oregon include like a lot of different types of kind of public bodies that don't fit in those buckets if you will that I already named and then for round two we did some work with K-12 Public Schools so we've had two webinars same webinar offered twice had about 75 people joined those which is pretty cool we had great turnout for the webinars that we did for round one we kind of considered this Outreach to be sort of low-hanging fruit Outreach and then planned on doing a lot of work that we're going to talk about today to kind of dig deeper for round three and four so any ideas of um and and thanks so much clay for putting um putting in there what I missed too um but yeah if you want to look at that list and see like who else would be good for us to reach out to and spread the word to we'd love to hear I'll be quiet now excuse me this is Mark Brady from business Oregon I just had a few thoughts um that I'll throw out there the list you sent it seems like you covered quite a bit but one thing that I was thinking about that's not really covered in that list is the uh the companies we might have technologies that these communities could deploy in these projects that the funds can support and so the two key groups that I could think of that you could Target to kind of reach that audience would be virtue lab and the Northwest environmental business council members of both members or companies affiliated with both of those groups a lot of them have technologies that might be able to be used in these projects um and then the other area I thought of is our agency has Regional staff based around the state and their job is to know their communities and the the both the businesses and the the public entities in their communities and they often know about projects that people want to do um and so they'd be a good group I think to be aware of so they can spread the word in their communities and similarly although this one is probably not it's not the best timing for it but the last one would be Regional Solutions I don't know if you'll talk to them but I know with the transition that's kind of probably a little bit messy right now so those are my thoughts and if you need connections I mean I can help you with the regional folks on our team obviously and I can connect you with virtualab and nebc if you need that oh thank you Mark I appreciate it I don't know if there's a coordinating um but the emergency managers uh in each County uh would be a good place to there there needs to be some Outreach around energy anyway uh for the resiliency side of things but you know there's 36 counties so there's managers scattered around the state and they may be a good conduit for projects that they've been thinking about excellent thank you Les hey this is Alessandra I was um thinking um also reaching out to foundations that fund social justice um organizations or Grassroots organizations um kind of like seating Justice or Northwest Health Foundation um Oregon Community Foundation just thinking about some um some of those foundations that could send that information out so that community-based organizations could also be aware of this funding excellent thank you Alessandra uh I'm not sure if there's uh there's probably some organization of our libraries I know that in a lot of our communities our libraries are kind of this de facto Gathering space for short or long duration catastrophe events thank you yeah I wanted to ask about um non-webinar formats um maybe going to communities and hosting open you know open open uh you know grant information sessions um where any of those kinds of entities could show up so you get more of like a you know instead of talking to all the school people from across the state at once over their screen you could you know you could be talking to schools and you could talk to an emergency manager and you could be talking to a library all at the same time just at kind of in a community uh fashion and that you the one of the benefits of doing that I can imagine is that sometimes people that there's dots that need to be connected um you know and for a resilience project I mean you do need you need a you know the uh one of the proposals I saw come forward here uh in Deschutes County um with the support of the emergency manager but you know they just happen to be talking and if they all showed up for a like a local Grant um Grant Workshop um it actually might help to cultivate some of those those connections that need to happen excellent Phil I think you know I think um Christy might actually have some uh have some things to respond to with that one that we had actually been discussing yeah I totally agree um I just went off like two just things one's like just one of those things that happens but um we were hiring for an Outreach position to do Outreach on all of our incentive programs like which includes C wrap but because you know it makes sense to me that if you're going out to talk to a bunch of people in one Community you can mention like different funding opportunities that might apply right so um the person that was hired for that position on the day they were supposed to show up for their first day decided not to start working with us so it's like a real major like I'm still like not recovered from the whole thing um I'm sure they would have been wonderful but um wherever he is uh but that was kind of one of the things that we imagine that person doing and that position I think is open right now um so we're hoping we'll get another awesome person through the the process and have more ability to do that we're also going to have a community Navigator um this was an idea that came from the environmental justice Community we actually did some Outreach to a bunch of different groups um to get ideas ahead of the legislative and this is an idea that came from um Lake County resources and uh Institute right that's not right initiative wherever the eye is um but they um they suggested that we have somebody whose job it is to just help communities apply for energy funds so you can see that that role would also be another one that could give us capacity to do that so we're definitely working on having that capacity the other piece is something that folks might remember me pitching you on a while ago and um we again were planning on doing it when we have ideally some um in the new year when we can't open up round three but are kind of waiting uh for round three to open and so the idea that we had and I'd be curious if folks think it's a good idea um I'd also be curious well I'll pitch I'll ask my second question after I say the idea um the idea was to have community-based organizations in a given Community kind of organize those meetings use their existing relationships because we don't know exactly who to get to",

um that we have a visitor that joined us a little bit late where'd he go yeah I see former Sheriff former Sheriff C just sliding in there did you want us to return to public comment did you want to come up and say anything he declines he is now just a private citizen good to you all right nice to see you colleagues I would uh entertain unanimous consent that we could move to the last action item number 11 uh to consider a resolution approving a rural industrial property tax credit for GK machines they've been patiently waiting no objection here okay all right so we will move to a consider resolution approving a rural industrial property tax credit exemption for GK machines Inc and Kelly uh I guess we have lots of sore people here and I I saw con I saw Connie over there I I Connie has stories she could tell about me so I have to be very nice to her are you going to come up to or I I have extra spots here if you'd like to come up to Jo yeah Joan if you want to come up I guess I got I see another former uh uh retired public servant too Nick haral retired yeah back backup I have nice to see you person okay who's going to take us off I'll take us off thank you very much um I'm Kelly whis I'm the economic development program manager here at Maring County and today we're talking about a resolution to consider approval of an application for our rural industrial property tax exemption program for GK machine they're located just outside of Donald with a hub address so I think Donald and hub both love to claim them uh but they're a great representation of our rural industry in Maran County so the rural industrial property tax exemption program serves as a tool to be able to support our businesses who are making a large capital investment in our communities and increasing employment and this allows for a potential for a three-year property tax exemption on any new improvements to their properties so the application from GK machine has been submitted to our assessor's office and has been reviewed and it meets all the requirements of the program if granted GK machine will be responsible for following up with all of the taxing entities that they're subject to to receive support letters from 75% of those so for 2024 the project site at 20495 bville Road has an estimated tax bill of about $6,000 so should the project commence with the anticipated 25 million in new taxable Revenue at the conclusion of the exemption period the property taxes for the site are estimated to be 313,000 a year so as part of their application GK machine has indicated that they anticipate hiring an additional 25 employees with an estimated full-time employee count of 185 at the end of this period so uh Maring County works with sore as we mentioned on our business uh uh retention and expansion program so I'm pleased to turn it over to Eric Anderson and Kip Morris with sore they can talk more about this project but of course we also have representatives from GK machine here as well so we have Joanne a a ag thank you who's GK machine's Chief Financial Officer and then Connie Lindsay who's GK machine sales and marketing welcome thank you so good morning Commissioners we'll we'll be brief on our comments just because I you know we have the company here too so if you want to have you know questions for them but um you know as we've talked about before we're very excited about this project GK machine is exactly the kind of company that we love to be helping in this region in this County um you know we just had our event last week that talked about tech and non-tech industries and this seems to be a message that we're always trying to send to our partners at the state level um who kind see Intel is the example of Technology we should be following and as you've all seen at GK um the amount of innovation and investment that they've been U you know continue to develop there is so impressive helps our a community helps all different types of Industries and um you know it's exactly the kind of business that we need to help um talking with with u Connie and Gary and and Joanne in the past we know um how challenging it is for businesses to actually get incentives in the in the state and um you know in the business climate that we've got in Oregon um we also know that there's other states that have been uh um courting you know a lot of our businesses here in GK is no exception um I applaud the county for having this resource available to us to help uh incent this kind of uh business to stay here um this involves a construction of a new building 140,000 foot um uh uh building and improvements to the existing building that's out there um and um we're very excited about the job creation and investment that GK continues to be uh um generating for Maring County so um and also just want to talk uh mention the um Innovation they're also doing with respect to employee housing and uh also looking into daycare for their employees because it's really um you know that kind of 360 degree look at how you really um can run a successful business these days so happy to answer any questions from s cor's perspective or From gk's perspective I I just Connie good to see you again um I I just drove down Beville uh I think last week I was I don't remember where I was coming from but is your new building further south down Beville there's a new building going up is that where it is that is where it is it's just south of the current location outside of Donald City Limits and that is actually puts us in hubard are you in hubard city limits or just a hubard address just a h hubard address okay that's interesting because hub's on the other side of the freeway I know it's crazy okay good like to come up sometime and and take a tour of what's going on I know Nick's kind of kept me informed over the years or this last year there's a lot of change going on so be great to visit with you and Gary and we love to get caught up we have some new uh facilities that we're building currently and some demonstration facilities on some high-tech growing operations so it' be fun to show you those good okay any other questions well could you tell us a little bit about the project um Joan would you like to share a little bit about the uh expansion so we are looking at adding introduce yourself oh sorry I'm Joanne a I'm the CFO of GK machine um we are looking at adding 140,000 square foot facility which is what we're currently working on to better lean and produce um Ag Equipment for the county and throughout the states um we have 160 employees currently and are looking to add more to that um to the community yes and um a lot more Workforce Development opportunities we are looking at putting in internships maybe an apprenticeship program down the road we're not sure yet um we are already adding a second swing shift to ramp up because the demand is there and so it's exciting opportunity for us the new facility is going to be designed for the operation to be extremely lean and state-of-the-art Robotics all kinds of new technology inside the building to help us meet the demand of our customers great good well we we appreciate you taking advantage of this uh Maring county is the only place that has implemented this particular uh Economic Development tool and we appreciate it when any business uh existing businesses this is what we what we did was trying to help existing businesses stay here and expand so great take a motion let's see uh go ahead yeah it's um so it states that um you all are required um based on this agreement to hire 25 new positions what what will that look like what what's the scale of the position do you have a a minimum wage that you're going to be targeting or does the agreement require what that wage scale looks like well actually we've opened um I believe this last month five new positions most of those are CNC Machining positions and programmers um so it's there are higher level paid positions as you expand you need the talent to meet that demand and a lot of it is the Fabricators the machinists the industrial painters me mechanical and electrical assembly technicians so these are higher paid these are not entry-level type positions that we're creating at GK thank you I think it's important most of the individuals in the public have no idea even what we're talking about more often the not one said cor comes uh hence city of Salem's position right now uh and I think it's this is a really valuable um opportunity that the county offers so thanks for sharing about the positions and I'm glad that you have five open and I look forward to seeing the other 20 come online um I think it's super important that we promote livable wage uh positions in our community so that way families can thrive in our community and we're not always just uh looking to bring on Entry which are very important but also so is stabilization so that's all I have okay let me take a motion from you okay um I got to figure out where it is on it's last page 11 y um I move to approve a resolution approving a rural industrial property tax exemption for GK machine I'll second a motion we have a motion and second any further discussion just um for the record they we we're going to approve this resolution and then they will go out and work with the other taxing districts to get their approval to make sure that this moves forward so we just initiate this process today any further discussion hearing that and all those in favor signify by saying I I I I okay go forth do good work thank you very much thank you great just kind of thought when Nick took me up last year on a tour uh with Gary I had was had the great opportunity to go through the current building all the stages of it and I do not remember what the name of the laser machine was but at first we were looking at sprayers agriculture sprayers which were you know the size of a small house uh and I have a little itty bitty bicycle that's about six pages thick of metal steel rather and that somebody created with that machine uh the scale uh",

        "text": " um Miss Gruber do you have a question do I see your hand up yeah um can you hear me okay um with the the that's really helpful um to see the estimates I did have a question of if we knew what confidence level those estimates were at or kind of what percentage of design we're at um just knowing that's possible can continue to grow as we get further and further into design um so I didn't know where we were kind of the life cycle of those projects um that's a really good question so I think the Springville Road Project we're feeling pretty good about it's far enough along in the design process that we think uh we have a pretty good handle on the scope at this point I do think um cost escalation just continues to really be a significant factor and we really don't have a crystal ball to help us understand just what the ongoing magnitude of cost escalation will be so I I wouldn't say that you're completely out of the woods without um potentially needing to increase costs for either the Springville or the Kaiser um increase our cost estimates again for those but um we feel relatively confident with the numbers that we have at this point and we have made some assumptions about cost escalation going forward in those estimates too thank you and the other uh sorry that was part part of the answer so the other part of the question projects that are not yet in the design process the other projects that have not been completed those are very much planning level estimates so they're they're rough estimates at best Mr Young you have a question yeah I remember this sort of I gotta have give you an explanation back when we when I first joined the committee several years ago Jaws to PCC uh thing was looking at a 2022 start ear and then you guys ran into some planning issues with the uh bridges that have to go over the Creeks that run under the road which made sense and they put it off till however now we're looking at a 2024 start date is this a matter of resources or it's just I was curious as to why there's another whole year we slipped that um I uh that's a good question I would have to go back and look I I think we I don't know that we've pushed this one back we may have pushed it back a year at some point in the process I think we had maybe initially hoped to get it out in 23 and now we're looking at 2024 so I'd um but yeah it's it's not we're sort of dealing with this across all of our transportation projects the permitting and design process is just taking longer than it did in the past for a variety of reasons and so we we are finding that it is taking us longer to get projects through the what we call the project development Pipeline and ready for construction okay but it's not a resources problem on the other end as far as getting people to actually do the job no no all right very good thank you thank you thank you I think uh that was that's a very good question because I think my recollection is that we had it starting and earlier and I think the maybe the concern there is that as we're pushing things out um you know inflation and things are causing right you know more things to be more expensive so when there are delays we're actually that's why we're having to come back in and throw another million into into something is that that kind of follow along with your your thinking Mr Young yes probably yeah I'm just thinking that it seemed I just wanted to know if there was any thing that they knew for certain to cause the delay but obviously if it's just a planning uh you know there's no saying no no plan of action ever survives contact with the Enemy so and that's true for across every discipline I've ever worked in so I suspected that's what it was but I just wanted to verify that thanks very much are there any other questions on for the people online um yes I had a just being able to look at the cost to um later late this afternoon and you guys a quick email like whatever 45 um today what my follow-up question um actually goes in line with um commissioner Rogers question um what what this is our our costing um estimate as of right now which is in 39 to 46 million what do our funding projections look like it seems like in the in the past we might have had some kind of a bar graph or something or I know there's this there's typically this pie chart of estimated allocations from back in 2011 um but obviously times have changed and costs have um so what what do we think if there is if they're it or going forward and it doesn't have to be for tonight but I think this is something that as commissioner Rogers was talking um we need to look at maybe if we're not going to have by the time this tax sunsets having enough money um oh a bar graph yay um having enough money to complete these projects and then um and then having to make those those decisions down down the road um prioritizing projects for finding some other raising revenues right so Mark if do you have that slide if you could pull that up yeah so I wanted to make sure that um so for those that are online I've just handed out a hard copy of a of a chart here that Mark will put up on screen so that you can see it as well we'll also have this posted on to the agenda page later and the uh the budget page as well so this was actually not a this is not an updated document but this is something that we had initially put together last year and sort of trying to illustrate the mix of revenues in the district over time so um as as you're alluding to we have a a build out process where we're collecting system development charges Transportation development tax and over time the amount of property tax generated by the district has grown significantly and is is uh is an ongoing Revenue Stream So the the property District or the tax the property tax that the district levies does not Sunset it's it's just designed to continue on and it could be um phased out at some point when it's no longer determined to be needed by the board but it is an ongoing Revenue um indefinitely and so the and that's the blue the bottom uh level on that pie chart if you will and so what you'll see in that chart is that over time we had some mstip funds that's county-wide property tax and that was used for some specific projects as a part of that funding strategy but that money has been spent and there won't be more of that funding coming into this District and you can see that over time the amount of system development charges and transportation development tax also diminishes and then we've just projected a that that stops at a at a point out in the future but there would be that continuing ongoing uh property tax revenue stream and we're estimating somewhere in the 1.2 to 1.3 million dollar range and that will vary depending on the growth and assessed value in the properties up in the district over time but we've tried to make pretty conservative projections about increases over time so there is that ongoing Revenue stream and so the idea was that that that ongoing funding mechanism is the way to ensure that we have revenues available at some point in the future to complete the other big unknown as we've talked about before I think is the just development we don't know how much of certain improvements development May construct before the county gets there it's obviously something that's constructed by a developer is not a revenue is not an expenditure or a funding requirement for the county so the more that development builds the less we have an obligation to build over and then as I say there's there is that ongoing Revenue stream from the property tax uh itself that would continue to fund projects over over the Long Haul but I think to your point and maybe to commissioner Rogers Point earlier there will be decisions that have to be made about prioritization so with any program like this you have more needs then you have money and so part of the ongoing work for us will be to continue working with you all to identify what the next priorities are as the funding is available right and then we're going to have to look at saving up I just as we have extra Revenue this year saving up that money and prioritizing the projects I mean there might be a couple of years where we're not allocating for any project while we save right um right prioritization yeah if if we continue with a pay-as-you-go approach um and that is the more conservative way to do this because you do have an ongoing Revenue stream there is a possibility of bonding against some of those future revenues meaning you can front load some improvements and you pay it off over a longer period of time that's not a policy discussion that we've had at this point but that could be an option that could be discussed with the board at some point in the future would you say that the um that the county Service District tax brings in 1.2 to 2 million a year because that was we're guessing in the 1.2 to 1.3 million dollar range and with a relatively slow growth rate over time around three percent per year sorry commissioner Rogers thank you I I just want to make the one statement but this line of questioning is interesting and I'll just um ask Stephen this question it uh we know we're running between 8 and 12 to 15 percent increases in Asphalt and various uh costs and you're you're going to get maybe two three percent increase on the on your your uh your Levy would it be helpful because if you already know my Prejudice my Prejudice is always the bond and I know that bonding costs but it certainly takes the escalation of inflation out but absent even that is would it be helpful to this group for future use because they're pretty smart people looking at the right to show what the delay in projects might be because unless a County Board which appears they're pretty solid on understanding that we're not backfilling with county-wide uh okay so if we continue that policy and I hope we do then what what's it going to look like if because you have you've done minor escalators I think that's kind of what Bruce was getting at and he said well are you taking an inflation rate but your inflation rates that I've seen on projects are nowhere near what's happening in the market so it would it be helpful",

        "text": " half mile from the site boundary rather than a mile so uh one of the issues raised by stop bth was whether or not the department's authority to modify these application requirements are limited to a situation the applicant has made a written request to waive requirements the hearing officer found that well that provision does authorize the department to modify requirements upon the applicant's written request it does not preclude the department from otherwise establishing on its own the applicable application requirements in the project order separately um and you know getting a little technical here but the the um the rule refers to the the mile uh boundary um the hearing officer found that that's not a requirement for issuing public notice uh public notice and entities that must receive notice are addressed in separate department or council rules that further the the rule at issue here does not establish or define the noise analysis so the hearing officer's ultimate conclusion here was that separately from modifying the information requirements in the the department acted within its authority and established the noise analysis area in the second amended project order as the area within and extending one half mile from the site boundary so again that's the summary of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order opinion and we'll now hear an oral argument from stop be to h on this issue good morning members of the commission my name is carl anuda i'm representing stop be 2h first let me point something out to make sure that we're all clear stop did not accept on the issue of notice stop only accepted on the issue of the in the project order of a pre-existing this is an interesting legal issue uh hopefully the council has thought through this basic problem here is that you have an existing rule that says one mile is what's required for the list the department's position is that you have another rule that allows you to modify that rule in a project order and the problem for you is the oregon administrative procedures act or apa is what governs rule making and it does not provide for having a rule that lets you modify a rule in an order it has very strict prescriptions you have to go through a rule making process that's publishes notice and does all the things that the apa requires that there's no dispute that didn't happen here so the really simple direct issue is odo pass a rule giving itself an exemption from the administrative procedures act rule-making or rule modification requirements stop's position is straightforward no every agency is bound by the apa if you want to change a rule you have to go through rule making you can do that on a temporary or emergency basis if you find that there's an emergency not sure how you could find there would be an emergency because power company wants to make a lot of money building a line but maybe that would they could try to argue that but the here there was no effort to get an emergency rule passed there was no amended rule that you could apply in a project order you had the existing rules instead the department modified the rule to say something that it didn't say so our position is very straightforward you don't have the authority to do that you the council should tell the department make them go back and do it correctly and why does that matter because that list that they create is the noise provides the public for you the ability to look at what noise sensitive receptors are out there and what might be covered by the project boundary or the project one mild and that's something that the public should know that's why your rules require that notice within a half mile you now have a whole group of people that were between a half mile and a mile that could never figure because the list wasn't accurately done whether they were on the list or off the and that's what happens if you change rules in the middle of a proceeding without going through the apa i'll be happy to answer questions if you have any thank you mr anuta any questions from council thank you mr anuta is asking you to look at one portion of your rules and to and excuse me i seem to have some sound going on here could i pause my time thank you i seem to have made all kinds of mistakes i think that's better all right and again for the record i'm lisa rachner um so mr anuta wants you to look at one portion of your rules which are the requirement lists for exhibit x to read that all by itself and say you can't change that rule except to do so under the apa but that's not the way you look at a set of rules basic principles of statutory construction require you to look at all of the rules and construe them together and if you do that you will see that odo definitely had the authority to make changes in the project order to the analysis area for noise and i hate quoting noise excuse me quoting uh rules by number but i think it's helpful to do so chat oar chapter three four five twenty one zero zero zero four that uh section provides that odo may waive or modify any of the application content requirements listed in chapter 21 that oto determines are not applicable to the proposed facility similarly 345-2100 states that the project order identifies the provisions of this rule applicable to the application for the proposed facility including any appropriate modifications to application of the rule so clearly within your rules itself odo had the authority to make a revision to the analysis area in the project order and that is exactly what they did there is no reason for rule making there is no error that was committed on a procedural basis here i also want to point out that um while odo excuse me well stop b-2-h is stating that they're concerned that people on that list going out to a mile may not have had proper notice at the same time they've said and this is true in their exceptions they didn't raise a notice argument so i think that's a red herring and the final thing i just want to emphasize is while odo did reduce the analysis area at the outset idaho power did analyze for noise only out to a half a mile ultimately in response to concerns and this is a familiar refrain you'll hear idaho power heard concerns idaho power ultimately expanded its analysis area out to one mile and as a result found one additional exceedance going out to one in the end the analysis area was out to one mile and finally in the site conditions that were adopted by the hearing officer ultimately idaho however idaho power is going to have to update the list of landowners going out to a mile provide them all with notice of the conditions that are adopted in the site certificate so that everybody going out to one mile is going to understand what the rules are around noise what mitigation they might be entitled to and what the process is for complaints and i see i've gone over apologies thank you miss rachner are there any questions from council not council row crow department of justice or the oregon department of energy i've said this before i think at least internally this is an issue that only an administrative law professor could love i don't have much to add to what ms rachner said but i will always good to hear things a couple times to help you make sure you're the rule at issue seeks only a list of and addresses of noise sensitive receptors within one mile of the proposed facility it doesn't establish a public noticing requirement and it doesn't establish an analysis area that rule doesn't say you have to analyze noise within one mile it says give us a list of the pro of the nsr properties within one mile also rules don't specify an analysis area for determining compliance with the noise control regulations there are statute as well as rules that provide authority for the department to establish application requirements in the project order okay so this what was done here isn't being done just pursuant to a rule it's also being done pursuant to a statute which says in the project order the department shall establish what statutes rules council standards apply to the application consistent with that authority in the project order the department set the noise analysis area at a half mile of the site boundary even if the division 21 rule at issue required analysis within one mile which it does not the department would have authority to modify that provision consistent with the statute as well as the rules that ms rachner just mentioned also as mr actor mentioned all of this is essentially moot because even though in the project order the department said analyze within half a mile idaho power ended up evaluating noise sensitive receptors and potential noise impacts extending out to one mile in response to public comment and concern about this issue council row any questions from the council okay do we want to continue our practice of taking on each issue resolving with straw poll for the proposed contested case order one at a time council convent cindy condon just a question for the department what was the reasoning for the half mile just general reasoning for half mile uh hello for for the record cal and tardy weather um that was established prior to sarah and i being here the establishment of the analysis areas happens after the notice of intent phase where there is there is a comment period and we we ask reviewing agencies to comment on if they have any feedback about analysis areas um you know agencies generally don't comment on noise but just for council to to take into consideration that um we take that information and then that's the basis that we modify analysis areas and then the your rules tell us to establish that in the project order which happens after the notice of intent um the intent is just that it is a longer linear facility to have kind of uh it's kind of like a reasonable factor um and this is just in conversations in our understanding with the people that did establish that because it happened prior to sarah and i being here but that that because it is this long you know 274 mile linear facility that a reasonable analysis area that basically going out a mile would just be a really big and maybe unnecessary this is and this is just from my understanding we don't actually have anything in the record that has a basis or a reason for it okay secretary cornett i believe we're ready for the straw poll okay this would be to agree with the findings so for the record todd cornett uh agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue nc one ken howe and buyer henley jenkins jordan truitt barry choctoot cindy condon thank you council members the next issue is issue",

        "text": " back and i highlighted that folks there is a dark green van on this slide that represents a projection for some amount of flooding offshore wind um and it shows up as being cost effective for the region um somewhere in that late 2020 time period right before 2030. renewals may be built across the region and oregon has access to outstanding offshore wind resources that are strong and consistent due to the ocean depths adjacent adjacent to oregon accessing offshore wind resources requires floating the posture wind technology which is different than bottom fixed floating welfare the bottom fixed offshore wind that's beginning to emerge on the east floating offshore wind and supporting transmission can have potential effects to ocean users and the environment loading offshore wind is also a unique renewable technology because it requires gigawatt scales for commercial deployment to be feasible it requires novel floating platform technology and new facilities to fabricate these it requires upgrades to ports to construct assemble and deploy the projects to the ocean and floating washerwood requires new transmission solutions both new offshore transmission and expanding onshore transmission welding offshore wind is a highly scalable resource dozens of gigawatts could be deployed and potential effects to ocean users and the environment can be avoided and mediated national labs showed tremendous technical capacity of floating offshore wind development in ocean waters adjacent to oregon coast a total of 62 gigawatts was was projected uh most of the technical capacity that's been identified is beyond 660 meter depth and that 60 meter depth is where um floating in offshore wind begins to become necessary beyond scalability the timing of one floating offer generates electricity complements the loads of one customer's demand electricity and also complements the output of other clean energy resources located on land especially during the winter and late summer times solar isn't always available it's available in days but not nights and severe degrees like more in summer seasons and less than winters in hyderabad our most abundant resource has significant variations from year to year and consistently lower levels of output in the late summer involved climate change forecasts also show that hydropower will be less plentiful during those summer months in future years the ocean location of floating offer wind and its generation profile can help optimize the scale of investment in onshore renewables and transmission rather than relying solely on the development of onshore renewables and transmission floating off your wind offers a new option to help reduce the risks of meeting the pace and scale of the renewable transmission build out necessary to decarbonize by mid-century floating option green can also provide coastal generation large-scale generation and transmission solutions and have reliability and resilience benefits for coastal customers and the bulk transmission system coastal customers are currently served by distant power generation that's supplied into the limited transmission pathways crossing the coastal range and floating offshore wind provides a new coastal source of large-scale generation flooding offshoring at the western edge of the grid also adds a new source of power flow on the bulb transmission system which can bolster grid reliability during routine outage events like a tree falling on a power line involves resilience during more unpredictable outage events like beyond grid there's other benefits economic development potentially the construction assembly and development activities necessary for floating off your wind projects could provide local economic development to coastal oregon communities supply chain of flooding offering components necessary for these projects can also provide economic development to other areas of oregon in every western states the average incremental coastal community is often less than the state average and floating offer one can bring jobs to bolster and diversify local floating off your wind generation along the coast may offset fossil fuel generation in other areas of the state region which could reduce emissions that disproportionately has now disadvantaged it also potentially has land use benefits floating off the wind and supporting transmission development could mitigate the cumulative development of new renewables and transmission on land new solar onshore wind and transmission crop chain transmission projects all have land use natural resource and or cultural impacts and developing floating offshore wind could mean trade-offs with onshore development to help that would help optimize the total amount of land necessary for achieving clean energy the map on the right on the slide shows large-scale transmission projects that were proposed in 2009 to help make the growth of onshore renewables these lines were never built but seeing these proposals offers a glimpse of potential transmission tradeoffs between developing renewables offshore and a challenge floating offshore wind requires a fabrication of floating platforms important upgrades and new and expanding transmission solutions all of which have tremendous upfront capital costs loading platforms require the construction of new facilities to fabricate them ports require new land development to meet the construction assembly and develop the development deployment needs floating off for wind and the gigawatt scales and floating offshore wind projects requires a new transmission in the ocean and expanding transmission on land gigawatt scales of floating offshore wind are also likely too large for the near-term demand of oregon off takers alone since there is not currently a deployment support procurement requirements specifically for the offshore wind resources oregon's approached market mixed morgan's current market-based approach means it's uncertain whether a single or multiple oregon utilities would enter into near-term on-state commitments a more prescriptive approach to flood and monitor development there is a commitment would mitigate a sole reliance on market competitiveness oregon and pacific northwest operate in bilateral markets where the cooperation among utilities and large power users is multiple off-payers is possible under the current market structure but requires utilities and large power users to be flexible and cooperative in their planning and procurement activities multiple organ off-takers may be challenging because worry in the pacific northwest lag formalized central planning to help coordinate law takers oregon lacks a collective statewide energy planning process and is not part of the regional transmission another challenge our complexities and set up with society and permitting floating off-roading could have potential effects on motion and land users and avoiding and mitigating these potential effects can be a significant floating offshore when projects their mooring lines and the necessary offshore and onshore transmission could all have potential effects in the ocean and on for example potential impacts to fishing shipping military and tribal interests in the interests of coastal citizens tourists and others floating off heroin can also have potential effects on the environment and natural and cultural resources avoiding and mitigating these potential effects could be another significant challenge for example flooding offshoring could have potential impacts of local and migratory efficient wildlife and sensitive habitats in the ocean and all the potential effects of flooding offshore would need to be addressed in the myriad of overlapping and required regulatory approvals at the federal tribal state and local levels before the development of a flooding off your wind project and supporting transmission needs were known so we've heard there may be gaps in the regulatory processes that make the identification and evaluation of chemical effects of floating option on privacy projects across multiple areas another thing where is that there may also be data gaps in imperfect knowledge and understanding of key potential effects which may make the avoidance and mitigation of potential effects more complicated and challenging another complicated challenge could be the comprehensive analysis of particular potential effects such as economic loss losses from excluded ocean areas ecosystem effects and potential aviation so my final two slides are kind of bringing it all together in uh really highlighting the highest level kind of take away from from what we've learned for our study so with the range of benefits challenges and complexities involved with flooding off your wind that implicates so many different parties locally across the state and across the region increased collaboration at all levels of government would overcome two of the primary challenges facing floating offshore wind the first achieving the optimal scale for commercial liability and multiple off takers addressing this first challenge increased collaboration would help optimize the potential scale of flooding offshore winding transmission and at the same time gigawatt scales and floating offshore running transmission are likely to have accumulative potential effects to the environment local land use and that's the second primary challenge so the second challenge related to that second challenge increased collaboration would also provide significant benefits towards evaluating and identifying motion and land sites per gigawatt scales of floating offshore window transmission solutions that are best to void in mitigating potential effects so in summary scale and citing optimization can be maximized by interregional and state global collaboration as soon as possible and then before moving into uh there's kind of the second phase of our presentation today tonight um invites bone and dlc to the table uh it's helpful to keep in mind the high level overview of all the actions and steps that need to occur before before floating offshore when project couldn't be doubled bones currently in the early stages of sleazing process which is the very first step that may or may not eventually lead to floating off your wind development the subsequent steps all have separate processes and timelines that need to be completed before launching could be after site control permits and approvals would need to be finalized port upgrades would need to occur onshore transmission expansion would need to incur interconnection and transmission service agreements we need to be far along their respective processes are already completed and off take a period would need to be in place a purchaser would need to be identified essentially then after some semblance of all these steps are accomplished construction may yes main time frame for all these steps to be worked through would be 10 plus all right so i know that was a lot of information and jason did flag that there's a lot of information but probably wouldn't be able to explain it all and so we just wanted to pause and see if there are any clarifying questions for jason and the odo team and just again a reminder the comments on the study is to like if we're missing anything or if you think that we should be studying other pieces we're hoping to have a later apartment this part is for any questions on the slides or what jason talked about that we could help this is christine i have a question from the chat if that's okay why don't you have the question from the chat and we have someone lined up to come uh right after that so go ahead and post it one second one person on the phone and then you're next sorry go ahead christine great so um it's a little long so here we go um i read a harvard belfor center analysis that said the national infrastructure will take 2.4 trillion dollars to upgrade we need 360 billion dollars by 2030 and we have less than 3 billion available for transmission loans now for the nation how is oregon going to pay for transmission upgrades also interstate",

        "text": " the potential whether it is worth it or not and the last very little interest with 20% saying that it is almost not important nothing if it has been tested anywhere other than Oregon then we did the calculations for each of these and and we obtained numbers and assigned ranks with the level of importance the most important was given three moderately two not important was given one we added them to obtain the weighted scores and they gave us this Priority ranking range let's say more than what is sustainable legal equitable no negative impacts no negative impacts on the economy or environment administrative effort and that it has been approved anywhere other than Oregon That's right how the different or the range of the different income options were rated after thinking about what we learned from the discussion groups, almost everyone in general has an agreement on sustainability they agree that there is a high level of importance for sustainability with income continuous against the one-time option So I think you should vote periodically on afterwards there was a certain difference with equity secondly with the subscription groups and thirdly with you afterwards no we did not ask in this product but in this group but yes We asked the focus groups about how important the estimated income potential is. This was very important because it ended up in third place and not in first place. That's something we have to consider when we're thinking about this decision-making framework. the impact on the local economy well eh And on the environment they ended up in similar positions for both also for both groups then legal viability for the discussion group a little further down and what we also ask is yes it is a chronology of impact as well and the level of importance qualifying eh short medium long term with the impacts or results and then we all see that we don't care if this works in other cities or not we care very little not as much as other aspects So something in these results that surprises you that you have questions when you think in putting together this decision-making framework using these criteria to evaluate the different options from now on How will they evaluate the impact on the economy, for example when we have other tasks on the same list, economy and environment, if I want advice here How to behave If suddenly I receive a consulting job a consulting position Yes, Cristal can call you personally and I also met a brilliant economist who works on another project that he lives in Oregon called Dallas I think that if you are an economist you immediately have his super cool name I'm going to ask him I'll call you. It's an excellent question. The impact on the economy to a certain extent is being evaluated by measuring and it has an impact on the environment to what degree we are evaluating it when we put together these decision-making criteria because it can quickly have many nuances. Good point is an excellent point, there was some discussion in the group sessions about the extension of the Tax measures, for example, they are only residents of Salem or people who are charged taxes who are from outside the issue of who is not mentioned. should be taxed but really focused on entities that use services within the city thinking that there is a lot of talk in the legislative proposal to recover funds for services provided by the city of Salem and there is also a lot of talk about what the environments are of Salem real estate there are offices in a couple of non-profit organizations uh government buildings and how they can be compared uh What are options that do not generate taxes or that in other cities are successful But what does the real estate landscape look like That was the conversation but we did not go into the topic of Who should be taxed or as residents or users, they were not asked that question. Okay, so thinking about using that information, one of the things we want you to comment and vote on tonight. It 's whether we're going to uh potentially adopt a set of criteria that can be used to evaluate different revenue-generating options in the future of tonight's discussion. It's really that if any changes would be made to the proposed criteria of the two options let's start with what were given in the survey and we are going to talk about the other two options that we were asked in the group sessions such as income potential and impact times And whether they are important or not To include them in the decision making or The making criteria of and something else that should be included in the decision-making framework as a criterion Yes, could you tell us a little about how you see us using this decision-making criterion about When we get to these income options we have How do we fill out for how do we continue with the decision-making process I would love to hear tell you that we have used those criteria as the risk assessment is done, we have these categories and in each category we have different options, some of which are binary options and not that they are associated with a rating number like how these are they graded using uh the weighted averages and seeing for the others if we put them against a low uh moderate moderate high So we're starting out and we're building each of the different options and assigning them a number so that then we can talk through the different generation options. of income uh we end up having a qualification a qualification a Range that can be used to put them on a list of priorities those are very viable Those are the ones that we want to look for and these are recommendations we group them together and we can understand what we have to have to comply With these objectives determined or yet to be determined there will be visuals in the future we will begin the conversation by looking at the two other criteria that we proposed for the work group for income potential group sessions and the times that impact whether they do so. we include as a criterion to evaluate different income generation options simply one or more that we feel are important to include as a rubric yes uh the answer Yes but when we see this we want to understand the calculated income uh then the cost of collection if we are below a million dollars is not worth even bringing it into the discussion from my point of view Even a number greater than a million dollars and the times Well there are things we can do like say hey urban renewal districts let's take away the renewal let's go to make it as a suggestion, nothing more, that is 3 million dollars that can be quickly returned to the city's budget, but in the long term it is a terrible decision to make, for a city to make a decision in the short term, it is a decision like, really, anyone. or the majority are having a significant income they are not going to be in the first year or in the second year then Well that is what I think Canton I just go back to the question I asked before in regards to income potential aligned with the income generation options That's the business analysis I do n't think we can consider any of those options eh even if it's a Range That's what eh For example An increase in franchise commissions is going to give us 5 million dollars it's going to cost a million dollars for management and then the net profit is 4 million dollars If we don't have that information How can we uh Well This is an evaluation point But is there some threshold that was too low that will cause another option to be excluded uh to be excluded There is a threshold that is too low eh And where there is we should exclude it from the recommendation And if the answer is no there is no threshold that is too low as long as it gives us a net gain for the city So we have to include it and we have it as An evaluation criterion is simply part of the Analysis, which is what I think you are trying to say, yes, eh, if we are using sustainability as a criterion, part of the analysis of the option a b or c of sustainability, of knowing how much it can generate for us in terms of sustainability, is it going to be a one-time thing or a source of continuous income generation Becky Biman I think it would be best if we did the qualification without the factors and put it in a plan and say this is going to give them an income quickly this will not give us it gives an income quickly this is something small but at the same time eh Eh This is too much trouble eh than it's going to help us just to give us a more general picture of everything What are these pieces that you want to make sure are under consideration when They are creating their menu yes And I also saw betth and then kit betth Vargas I agree Thank you and uh I simply disagree because we can have in terms of the rubric situation one of those grades is going to have less than half a million and the grade It's zero but uh gives us 45 million but its rating is five so I think that uh one of the most important points if we can get money quickly the fact that it's sustainable or not is not so important is the quick money that we can get we have an income of50 million in the next two years eh As a one-time thing is going to sustain us in the future I think it could enter the rubric and that is not a threshold that is required if we have the way to assign the value and the rubric to those different uh Like boxes or levels of financing and we are qualifying the income If we are not excluding them if we are not excluding any option only the income potential part of the Analysis is going to be what it is going to generate for us over time if it is not something that is used to evaluate or eliminate different options that do not require an income maybe it is not useful that we had it as part of the criteria and it is not Useful to eliminate it but to qualify the ranges it could be useful eh As useful As some of these other measurements and I also saw that it is He raised his hand and then Bill Jin po put in points 3 cu and C are subjective uh the analysis is going to have enough to provide enough information to qualify them or be equitable in like income people value of their houses but local economy I don't know how it works and how it impacts the environment, so they really are important but I don't know how we are going to measure them. That is my comment",

        "text": " electricity um I also I want to say these zero missions bus Toppers on the what are we calling it which quarter the green quarter electric quarter electric bu quar I love them I can't wait to go right yeah thank you have to give shout out to the marketing team uh Jonah Hansen's design director hrom thank you so I think my my main burning question is when does the board get to ride uh one of these things or drive or drive I've heard the tires chirp not anymore thank uh so we could certainly arrange any time that that uh any member of the board would like to come out um I know we had a bunch of curious operators just this afternoon that said can have the keys to the car and um they did get to go for a a spin in the bus uh on property so anytime very exciting so uh excited also that we're going to get um apparently some inductive charging for Christmas that's good um so the the Del charging says if it starts by this Sunday how how certain is that do you think that we're I mean that's a couple days away we're talking about here so it's it's unknown at this point so very unlikely okay I'll say Bank on it it won't happen on Sunday gotcha so we're still talking weeks months so once uh once the City of Salem releases our permit it'll take a week to um to uh muster the Contracting crew uh and then we can start um we have um we'll have uh as a part of our monitoring plan um a qualified archaeologist monitoring also soil disturbance activities uh and that should take 3 weeks so by Thanksgiving we should have some trenches done if if uh everything happens so I mean realistically we could say the 16th October but I I don't want to put anything in ink right now I I appreciate that's already taken I think longer than everyone expected so um unexpected things happen when you're digging the dirt so um I think that's all I have for now you director Navaro thank you president Davidson so or vice president Davidson I have been getting that wrong all night um I don't know if we can pull up the slide from the D web station so in in that slide um you talked a little bit about Electric Avenue and uh so I'm just trying to get a better picture of where these dehumidifier things are going to go and uh and where the the buses are going to be parked are they going to be under the cupboard are they going to be out in the exposed uh elements and and plugged in is okay so we'll get to that picture thir from the last slide there we go go back one okay so um I I I say go back to this one director Naro because it's actually more zoomed in so where you see seven buses right where uh the cursor is right there the buses will be backed in just like that the uh charging dispensers will be along the sidewalk that's right at the tail of every bus um uh Greg had specked the buses so that we could charge from either right or left side so it doesn't matter if it if the Charger's occupied or whatnot um the Transformer will go to the northwest corner of the bus wash and it will feed the switch gear will be attached to the building and then the um distribution blocks uh will be in in in two rows that will run east to west just on the north side of the bus wash that was very convoluted if my pointer worked so right go to your uh go to the West a little bit in the the picture C so right there so in that area right there you'll see all the distribution blocks and so we will have um six distribution blocks they will feed 12 dispensers oh wow and then we'll get more as we get new buses delivered awesome thank you D you're home so yeah just to follow up on that so I assume that there's conduit that's being installed for future dispensers and and distribution blocks for future okay yes so we will have all of um so thank you that's an excellent point so the conduit will go under the sidewalk all the way from the far um from the first bus stall on the west all the way to the last stall on the East uh and that so we'll only have 10 buses we'll have 12 dispensers in ground but we'll have the conduit run so that we can um just stub up um the remaining Chargers to fill out um what I'm calling Electric Avenue once we get the other buses like the the ones down the road um we'll have to look at where we're going to put those because Electric Avenue will be filled and then we'll have um probably the need uh from what I'm told the need for another Transformer because that'll be as much as that Transformer can feed does that help answer your question about where they'll be okay um first a comment for me the I'm I I think I've heard this before but I am still shocked that the induction charging can do 300 kilow like that is DC level charging at a you know Electrify America location like topof the line high speeds to give you P some people perspective my Chevy bolt can only accept 55 kilowatt so like it just can't even accept 300 kilow so I guess that leads me to a question though which is how much can our buses accept and I recognize that this might be a great question and you're in the hot seat but so he can smack me later but um those the the the receiving pads on the bottom of the bus can receive all 300 kilowatt really um but um it will is so I I say that in that it doesn't like throw the switch and you get all of it right away so it ramps up and it there's a sweet spot that it gives you kind max power and then as it gets to I know I'm going to say this wrong 85% it starts to slow down because you don't want to boil anything in there um so then it it slows back down so what we're learn I mean we're learning already uh we haven't put a bus on those Chargers obviously yet but um the gillig technicians say you don't want to when you finish your Loop park it and charge it you don't want to do that you want to get it down um to a state of charge much lower than what we're probably going to be at when we come through there so um it's it's changing the way we're kind of how we're going to do that we're not going to really know until we do those tests so we want to run the loop in real kind of Life uh performance and go to ktc and see where we at and then run it again and see where we're at and run it again and then see how far we can go before we uh have to put it on the charger right okay and then for the at Del Web the plug-in charer charers do you happen to know what the output is 150 kilow in okay that's more of what I was expecting I am wow okay I I recognize that the induction charging we won't be there very long it's just like a holdover period but that that is remarkable two I guess one one comment is that I would have loved for you know the ribon cutting to have happen happened months ago I think all of us would have um but I I do just want to appreciate and acknowledge the thoughtful and deliberative process that you your team and everybody else is taking with this I'd much rather have us do it right than do it quickly and you all are doing that very well so kudos to you all thank you um in a so uh president Enos prey will almost certainly have asked this question if she were present and and uh this may be a chief communication officer feny question but will there be Lego buses of the battery electric bus when there is a ribbon cutting that will be a question that she will ask I imagine at her next meeting and then um in a similar vein does the color green have a name like thunder blue like is there is there a colorful like something I can sink my teeth into Cricket yeah green with vice president Davidson there is a name for it but the fact that we started the Rebrand in 2016 I don't think that my 59-year-old mind can comprehend right now where that color is but I will send you an email first thing in the morning thank you I'm I'm looking forward to it could you CC director Carney actually I don't want to do preferential treatment so I'll send it to all of you very sensible so any further questions or comments okay chief operating officer Deets thank you very much uh next general manager Paul your report great thank you thank you I do have a few items to report uh first is uh trans Dash related as you know we are one of the originating members of the trans Dash program uh along with Lane District I am uh happy to say we received the announcement that tryit is joining trans de so all three Transit districts in Oregon will be a part of the the program which will allow for some friendly competition as we look at uh the reports uh uh so more to come on that as they sign on they have it they've they've made the commitment and they're going through the process uh it is time again for the Oregon travel study so if you're not familiar with that that happens uh once per decade and it's a survey of Oregon households uh that helps provide critical data for transportation policy decision makings and investments in local and state and federal levels uh the goal really is to uh uh send out surveys to about half the households in the state of uh and uh those that complete the study will be compensated with the uh travel a debit card so if that is exciting to you please fill it out uh so so why are we doing this well we're doing that because Transportation planners and policy makers who use the data over the next 10 years uh to create safer more sustainable and Equitable transportation systems for all users throughout the state uh the results should be published 2025 and so if you receive a survey or if your friends or neighbors ask you because you're on the transit board what's this travel study please encourage them to participate uh uh the more information the better uh so last month uh we shared with you that uh uh chots uh received the sustainability award at the Maran County sustainability Summit uh and uh uh",

        "text": " can see there is a right of way that goes between the home and the structure. Here's a picture showing the structure with two bays. The right of way is unpaved. There is a code case because of the building without permits. And staff is recommending denial. Simply because of how big the parcel or the structure is. Because it's. You would never be able to put a primary structure on the property. So there would never be able to be a home on that property. To make it a whole r one piece. But the applicant is here. And the planning and zoning commission did recommend approval of this special use permit. Thank you. Do we know if there is electric or plumbing on? From my understanding, they were trying to get electric to the property or to that. So that's why. That's what triggered the sup process. Okay, thank you. So there. What. So how did the complaint come from? My understanding, it was when they applied for electric permit. That's when building apartment showed or code officer showed up to see that there was a structure without a permit there. Okay. I just wanted to verify that. And we do have conditions that we can go over if you choose to approve the special use permit. But they are in your packet as well. Thank you. Any questions for staff, mister. Rayrock? Now if not, do we have the applicant with us today? I'll invite you to come over to the podium. Hi, how are you? Good. You can pull that microphone down and name an address for the record, please. Olivia O'Quinn. 15271 Northeast 243rd court, Salt Springs, Florida, 32134. Thank you, Miss O'Quinn. And so how did you end up getting this built without a permit? So we actually purchased the house next door. We got a mortgage on the house, the parcel, and the pole barn kind of came with it. So we did enclose it, and then we tried to get electric, which then we realized there was no permit for the existing pole barn. And so since then, we have had it engineered, and then we ran into the problem of it not it being too big for the parcel itself, but obviously, we live across the street, so we would never want to put a home on that parcel. The only reason we can't marry it is because of that small road in between. Yes, ma'am. Okay, very good. Any questions from staff? If you'd like to have a seat, we're just going to ask if there's anyone in the audience who'd like to speak to this. Yes, ma'am. Is there anyone in the audience who would like to address the board concerning this issue? If so, I invite you forward. Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the board. Go ahead. Go through the conditions real quick, Ken. So if utility connections, that would be determined at the time of the permit, the applicant is to maintain a minimum of five foot, no touch around the perimeter to keep the natural vegetation there, no signs on the property. The site would be consistent or built the way it is now and consistent with that, and would not be allowed to expand. And the special use permit would be granted for this garage only if the garage is removed in any way. It would not be allowed to be rebuilt. And it would run with the property because it is a physical structure, and obviously, and it would expire if it was converted into a residence or destroyed or removed. Okay. Thank you, Miss O'Quinn. You understand all the conditions? Yes, ma'am. And you're willing to comply with them? Yes, ma'am. We already, technically, are very good commissioners. Does anybody else have anything they want to add? So I'm going to move for approval. This one's for Jack. Amen. Don't do that to me. Well, if you know, if you know, you know. Motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Curry. Any further discussion? All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries. Unanimous. Thank you. That's going to take us to item number 1535. Chris rising with the growth services department. This is request 24. So six. It's a request for a comprehensive plan amendment for a commercial future land use designation on a site which is located on Highway 42 just east of US 301 and the active rail line in the southern portion of Marion county. The property is nearby that intersection of Highway 42 and Highway 301. It's approximately 2.27 acres. There has been no opposition received in regards to the request. And just for notation, the planning and zoning commission did actually recommend approval for the site, just for notation for staff. This is the existing property. It included a house with a storage structure. There are two residences to the east. This site here used to be a junkyard. It is now currently being redeveloped into an rv storage facility. Just to give you a perspective, this is that main intersection of the location. This dark red here is the dollar general. This is a future 711 which is currently working through permitting. Except for this is the existing historic quick kingdom. Now a different convenience store that's been there for a number of years. And this is the Artman barbecue. Well, you sound like Chris Risen. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't look like him today, though. Oh, I've changed a little bit there. Yes, I'm gone for summer. And again, the area is currently commercially designated, but it does include a large amount of undeveloped commercial properties, which is a concern for staff. And then again, the different zonings are a different combination out in this region. I will note from a staff standpoint, for commercial land use, they have a floor air ratio allowance of one. They also have a residential density allowance of eight dwelling units per acre. They are seeking that this site has an existing b two zone and classification, and so they would be essentially activating the b two commercial so they could use it consistently with that land use and zoning. That would provide for approximately 98,000 sqft in a non residential use. But that would be subject, of course, to site plan and development standards. Just to give you a perspective of the site, this is the area to the east or to the west, which is under construction as an rv storage location. And this is the perspectives across the site. The applicant has proposed that they were looking to do an irrigation supply office on there. We have noted under the b two, however, they would only be able to do the office type uses. They would not have a contractor trades allowance for that site unless they sought either a special use permit or some other changes in the future. For a general perspective, to the west or to the east. Excuse me, you have. This is one of the homes which is to the east, right along highway 42. This is the view down 42. This is a property which is to the southeast and then directly across this is another larger parcel which was in 2015 converted to commercial land use, but it still remains undeveloped. Then as you go to the southwest, this is the Artman barbecue. This is that back towards the west, this is the railroad crossing and the rv storage location, which is currently under development. And their current title that they're advertising is the North Village storage. The site is tightly designated rural lands. It's outside the urban growth boundary or an urban area. It's not in vicinity of the urban growth boundary, but it is in vicinity to a couple of urban areas. The intersection at 301 and 42 does have commercial land uses, but limited development at this point in time. Two sites are under construction, one of which is the mini storage or the rv storage. Plus there is a mini storage location being developed on us 301, but we don't have any other activities at this point in time other than that 711 to the east, you have the Artman barbecue and then the rv storage. So the area's core intersection and properties do remain largely undeveloped. They have an allowance for a great deal of development potential, but right now they are very underdeveloped at this point in time. And there's also a new 32 acre commercial area established on South 301 at the Marion County Sumter county line. They're in proximity to the Oxford Downs facility, and all of that land currently remains undeveloped at this point in time. So this site would represent an expansion of an urban area into the rural area and provide for kind of a strip along Highway 42, which is a concern for staff, and staff would not support the request for that. So under policy 1.15, we do allow for higher densities. Their b two zoning does have a limitation. The commercial would match to the b two zoning. However, I will note that. And then for rural areas outside the urban growth boundary, we do try to see those remain lower densities, lower intensities, until it's time to actually begin to make conversions, if conversion is a suitable activity for that property. So at this point, staff is noting that it would not be compatible with the surrounding land uses. It would adversely affect the public interest, and it's inconsistent with the plan and the statutes that's based on their current and existing situations at this point in time. And again, the planning and zoning commission did disagree with staff and they did recommend approval. Thank you. Any questions for Mister Risen? Just real quick, Chris, can you bring up that the map that shows the current zoning all around this parcel as it sits now? Thank you. This is the zoning for the current site. This",

usual this is really an opportunity for us to encourage new practices and invest in areas that Advance these types of natural climate Solutions where we haven't been able to advance them at a at a pace that we would um want so it's just a really good opportunity to encourage these new practices you'll see that it the package also focuses on immediate actions to sequester and store carbon while supporting some forward-looking needs solutions so that is just kind of an overarching description of the package I'm going to hand it off to each of the four agencies to just tell you a little bit more about their investment areas and then I'll do a wrapup that really kind of focuses in on the numbers um at the end so chair McDonald unless you want to kind of not sure if you want us to just keep moving throughout this or if you'd like to entertain questions as we go we're very flexible with whatever you you would like the format to be yeah I would just encourage Commissioners if you have a question especially a clarification question as we go through the presentation feel free to um raise your hand and I'll I'll Zach and I will call on you but otherwise I'd say just go ahead okay great okay with that I will hand it off to Stephanie pagee to talk about the oeb investment great good afternoon chair McDonald and Commissioners Stephanie page with the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board um and I'll just go ahead I think we're waiting for my slide to advance but I'll just go ahead and start there we go um we're o is asking for $2.5 million alog together and as you can see on the slide the request will help support restoration technical assistance conservation management planning and implementation and potentially easements and Covenants on natural and working lands and we've also requested out of the $2.5 million 250,000 in administrative costs um as allowed in House Bill 349 in terms of how these funds would be dist distributed the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board is a grant making agency and we provide grants to um eligible parties including local governments nonprofit organizations like Watershed councils land trusts tribes and schools and institutions of Higher Learning and we're we would propose to distribute These funds as grants to the eligible entities that that we work with those types of organizations and use our existing Grant Administration structure one thing I wanted to mention before I go on to talk about the programs in a little more detail is that oab's Grant Administration process operates predominantly on a reimbursement basis and so that means we conduct technical review of project applications we award grants we develop Grant agreements we project manage the grants and as the grantee implements the project they submit requests to us for reimbursement so it may look um for the first couple of years for a a project for example that the funds have not been expended when um in actuality the grantee is in the progress of implementing the project and just hasn't build us yet or hasn't build us for the full amount so I wanted to mention that and now we can go to the next slide so the two existing Grant programs that we're proposing to leverage to distribute These funds are the open solicitation grant program which includes on the ground restoration and technical assistance grants and the Oregon agricultural Heritage program and this program includes grants for conservation easements and Covenants technical assistance and conservation management plan development and implementation so one of the values of using the existing programs is it does leverage the rules and and the guidance that we already have in those programs but we would also likely do some customizing to reflect um some of the unique aspects of House Bill 3409 and the funds um that are included in the natural and working land fund so as part of that we're proposing to prioritize uh projects for EJ communities and tribes and we will select projects that have clearly identified climate benefits and we do have mechanisms through those programs to do that so I think I'll just pause there and see if folks have any questions but that's that is a high level summary of what we are requesting uh thank you Stephanie um you included in the list that it may include acquisition of Rights uh or interest in properties um through the egg Heritage program do you have a sense of how much you you might put towards technical assistance versus management plans versus um property rights we we haven't um determined I think one one other thing I'll mention is that OAB is a responsive Grant agency so we accept applications that come in and then EV in this case we would evaluate them for those climate benefits including carbon sequestration and and resiliency and then make funding determinations based on those evaluations so I think one one challenge with easements and Covenants is you could and and restoration projects for that matter is that one or two projects could consume that entire amount versus um wanting to protect some for technical assistance but it it does depend somewhat on what projects come in the door uh I should also mention that my colleagues Jesse kersner and Taylor Larsson from OAB are also on with me and so uh I want want to thank them for being a part of putting this together thank you Stephanie any other questions uh commissioner after yes um thank you so much Stephanie super exciting to see this initial proposal thank you for all the good work and thinking that you and the web team have put into this um I well first of all really um excited to see some of these initial or the summary of prioritization um and specifically the call out around carbon sequestration which of course is a major goal of this fund um as well as the intend intended priority to EJ communities and tribes um I was curious I heard Debbie mentioned at the outset um the goal of leveraging federal funding as something that is key kind of across um agency proposals and use of funds so wondering if you could speak to how you're um that as it applies to um obb's proposal and um also curious around the separately the process that you laid out for reimbursing um entities if that's something that I I assume youve found has worked well but if there's any consideration of whether that might um be adjusted given that these funds will hopefully be available in the near term and something that might be able to um be appropriated at the outset or just anything where you want to add to that existing process okay um absolutely commissioner atter I'll um I'll take those one at a time so I think the first question was around leveraging and a few thoughts there I think the the most clear opportunity for leveraging is in that conservation easements and Covenant space there is a federal program um called the agricultural conservation easement program agricultural land easement if I'm remembering the acronym correctly that does provide grants for easements and Covenants and it requires State match so that that is one opportunity for Levering leveraging federal dollars another is the technical assistance grants could be used to develop or design a project that is then proposed to a federal program so that's another opportunity for for leveraging perhaps in a slightly different way and then uh finally I would mention that many of the projects that oeb funds are also eligible for funds from the USDA natural resources conservation service so the um there is opportunities at a at an individual project scale to bring in some of those funds and then one final thing I wanted to mention is um talking about the technical assistance grants in obb's open solicitation program we historically required match for those funds but in order to make the funds more widely available we um reduced the match requirement for those dollars so it does potentially reduce the leveraging opportunities but it hopefully makes the program more accessible as well um and then the second question I think was around reimbursement um so obb developed a practice of a reimbursement based program over the years in response to feedback from various audits as we were continuously improving the design and implementation of our program so that's one of the reasons that we operate predominantly on a reimbursement basis we do offer advances with certain sideboards so a grantee could request in advance if they needed that cash to help get a project started they do need to provide documentation to us within 120 days of receiving that Advance again for um for good uh Administration purposes is Stephanie not to put you on the spot but do you happen to know off the top of your head what your oab's current leverage rate is um you know for every oeb dollar you often leverage X or Y relative to the maybe not the technical assistance but the the um open solicited solicitations uh I don't have that right in front of me Kathy but I think I can find it by the end of this presentation we're preparing our Oregon plan banial report um that we're required to prepare and that is one of the things that we look at so I will see if I can find that here in the next few minutes thanks thanks so much Stephanie any other questions for Stephanie it looks like um no no I can't see if I can't see any hands up Debbie you're cutting in and out quite a bit we'll just move on have ODFW thank you okay just a sound check can you hear me commission yes thank you Sarah um good afternoon chair McDonald members of the commission I Sarah R I'm the habitat division administrator with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife uh pleasure to be here with you this afternoon um we uh took a two-pronged approach to our proposal here for the fish and wildlife portion of the fund um mainly looking at funding on the ground projects directly and then also creating capacity to even further accelerate uh Oregon's acquisition of federal funds and better centering our restoration work on the goal of carbon sequence sration so really intentional with with the projects that we brought forward for your consideration our total request is just over 3 million um as you may know ODFW has been really active in tracking and successfully acquiring federal funds recently since the bipartisan infrastructure legislation or iiga as it's often referred to and the inflation reduction act programs began releasing funding opportunities ODFW has successfully brought in more than 58 million to Oregon for fish wildlife and water projects so several of the projects that we bring forward for your consideration here have either acquired or are in the process of applying for iiga or IRA funds other federal funds that we were able to leverage",

        "text": " expressing concerns about the timeline and have been very active in working with the team on trying to problem solve within our current Financial constraints of the revenue so this is really maintaining that ongoing stakeholder relationship moving forward and in terms of the budget piece of all of this being built into the budget and the assumptions that Stephen how will that be teased doubt from the budget so that we pay attention to this issue that if we do hear some significant concerns then we come back and have more conversation about this I'm not debating that 50 is needed I think your previous meetings convinced me the work you did like where we need to Center the best interest of Washington County that is in the debate How We Do and how we roll out is the question for me so I'm wondering I don't want the the budget piece to be lost and uh we neglect certain details especially I I wouldn't speak for myself so how will that be teased out from the budget because the budget we're gonna get is a huge binder and they think that this has a significant impact for certain group but then again it has ties to the governor what we're trying to do with our Supportive Housing so we need to let me try to say I think what we need to do is put together a resolution and that we adopt uh with regard to budget direction for these Building Services and Community planning fees so that it's clear that we're we're trying to make improvements to the system that we already know doesn't support the industry sufficiently move towards a more robust system uh and ensure that you have the uh appropriate direction from the board to construct your proposed budget um due due to timing we will bring that rno back to the next board meeting does that make the process more complex so we're asking you to do the Arnold uh no in essence it sets that policy um in place um that we would just be um kind of reiterated in the proposed budget process and proposed annual fee and I think the quarterly touch points I know you'll be getting quarterly budget updates and so this probably would be one of the funds that will be highlighted in that budget update so you'll get a sort of a snapshot of how things are going throughout the year and and then of course we're happy to provide some sort of a supplemental quarterly written update just in terms of service levels things like that I think we can we can do those things and part of my part of my request was also to make sure that we don't get into this position into the future as well that is the bottom line objective of all of this is to try to get us out of that situation yes thank you and that's a part of documenting all the work as well and documenting our expected service levels going forward if we document them we'll know when we're not meeting them right away and so that's a big part of this work yeah onward to part two thank you all and just to hone your estimation skills in the future uh it takes us a minimum of a half hour to get through any departments all right well good afternoon chair Harrington Board of Commissioners my name is Mira samantel I'm the director of Health and Human Services and with me I have Marie Bowman Davis who's our Public Health division manager also in the audience is John Kohler Gucci who is our environmental health program supervisor so he's available for subject matter questions if they arise I know we're a little short on time but I will do my best to move us along we are here today as you know as a follow-up to the work session we did on January 23rd our proposal our staff proposal Remains the Same which is 100 cost recovery with an environmental health but we are following up on some items that you wanted clarification and had questions on in addition to feedback from our Public Health advisory Council um so just some high level um kind of uh eye level Trend setting for what we're talking about today for anyone who in the audience wasn't here on January 20 on January 3rd sorry I mean as a reminder to all of you so the environmental health program within in public health currently fulfills specific statutory responsibilities with a combination of fee revenues and general funds subsidy your board your board of county commissioner serves as the local public health authority governing body and as such you were able to make um schedules of fees you can adopt fee schedules for public health services that are reasonably calculated and not to exceed the cost of services or form um so each year our fees have increased just a little bit about three to five percent on average but they haven't been able to keep up with actual costs within environmental health our existing methodology that we've been using for fee setting predates our current staff and so we've been challenged with understanding how fees are produced I'm utilizing our available data and determining how to recover program costs um so because of that in early 2022 HHS contracted with Marina and Company it's a local CPA firm to revise our fee setting methodologies and tools so we could really plan out our fiscal year Revenue forecasting so we could move towards full cost recovery um so again what we're looking at what we're bringing to you today is a recommendation to budget for 100 cost recovery this would do an estimated general fund subsidy Savings of approximately 260 000 dollars so on this slide um you're going to see a chart this is an updated chart um thank you all for your patience as we had some errors on it last time so we've corrected those errors so this chart shows budgeted revenues and budgeted expenditures going back about six fiscal years it also shows the gap between revenues and expenditures and therefore the general fund subsidy amount um as I said before we've had incremental increases averaging three to five percent but they haven't kept pace with our expenses resulting in that ongoing general fund subsidy there were questions last time about fluctuations in our general fund subsidy why was that um so we wanted to just provide a little more information for you so the main reasons for the fluctuations um first as I mentioned before we didn't have a good tool we didn't have a good methodology that really captured our expenses and that is being fixed in this school that we have in the marina and Company in addition um there were issues in the local economy that impact our ability to forecast at covid-19 as a perfect example there were things that we could not predict in terms of restaurants closing the amount of time it would take for them to reopen how long it would take for them to catch up on business so we just really didn't have a good way to um those those revenues and our Associated expenditures that's why you see this fluctuation um so just for the audience because I know it's small so the blue line up top is the is the expenditures and the orange line is the revenues and that Gap in between them is reflected Below in the gray boxes um let me see you just make sure I covered all these um so again this is why we engaged Marina and Company and our new tool that we have is really also going to be able um to assist us in kind of forecasting in a way that we're going to be able to capture Personnel changes so for um I think it actually might be on the next slide I was talking about workload demands oh it's on the next slide oh wait I'm gonna pause there any questions on this because I know last time there were concerns about the chart and we have fixed that what percentage good question okay so Financial impacts that was like a perfect segue commissioner Rogers um so 100 cost recovery what we're looking at is an average of anywhere from five percent to 11 we have three different categories we have restaurants pools and tourists and other food so it's gonna be different depending on what category as a reminder we have 200 different fees in environmental health the ones you see on this chart up here this is just a small sample and so we have a sample of a restaurant over 150 seats a class 4 food cart a hotel Etc so these are just a sampling of fees we have 200 different fees so that's why you see the big variation and this is where sorry I was going to speak to the equity um our fee calculations resemble a targeted universalism approach to fee recovery or to cost recovery so we're not just doing a flat two percent increase or five percent increase we're going to really base it on the costs of each of those services so that we're having that universalism approach to cost recovery so again it's going to vary depending on um depending on which V it is and which category it is we did add um this wasn't here last time on January 3rd the temporary restaurant Booth commissioner fi I think you had brought this up what about somebody who sets up for a fair or um you know for a farmer's market um so we reflect what that cost would be so it would be it would go from 251 dollars this is an annual fee by the way for all the categories 251 dollars to 254 dollars to a three dollar increase for that particular category questions on this slide yeah and I think um um I had issues with it says estimated 11 but some of them were considerably higher than 11 so I felt like we were being a little disingenuous in that and I don't know how you communicate that I know it's an average but if I were to get a bill that said it was the 25 I'd come back and say Hey you told me it was 11. yeah right so I don't know how we communicate that better but that's that's probably my concern I think specifically you're looking at Pools and Spas that are much more than your 11 percent so anyway I haven't I didn't do my math on those things but just looking at it I think that's my concern with this okay and um and we do have I think the um in the full board packet from January 3rd provides a little more detailed um but definitely in the actual fee schedule it would outline each and every one of those 200 different fees and what their increases would be um we'd be happy to follow up with you um later commissioner I just don't know how you communicated to because the previous information did give you much more detail and that's where I went in and started looking at okay you're talking about large restaurants versus small restaurants and food carts and pools and we heard we have 200 swimming pools or something in Washington County which all of us were really",

and of Washington County and who are instrumental in its ongoing and future successes and whereas the official designation of May as AI Pi heritage month was signed into law in 1992 to and celebrates all asian-americans native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders known as the a nhpi community whose variety of of contributions have built our culture and society and whereas we celebrate all of those who are included within the a nhpi community which is made up of culturally and linguistically diverse peoples representing populations from many countries and islands and whereas the theme for this year's observance is advancing leaders through Innovation which pays homage to The Visionaries and Trailblazers who have shaped our a anpi history and continue to influence our Collective future and whereas we recognize and remain committed to the belief that opportunity is a set of circumstances that make it possible to do something and that opportunity can be built it can be accessed it can be achieved or it can be given and whereas we recognize the innumerable contributions vibrant cultures and Rich Heritage of the aipa community and whereas we acknowledge appreciate and continue to seek the contributions and Leadership of asian-americans native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders who have played a significant role in our history and the community fabric of Washington County and in the fields of Science Education agriculture government Commerce the Arts and many many more now therefore be it resolved that on this 23rd day of April 2024 the Washington County Board of Commissioners does hereby Proclaim May 2024 as Asian-American native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month encouraging all residents of Washington County to share in the special tribute by learning about and celebrating the generations of asian-americans and uh Native Pacific Islanders and native Hawaiians who continue to enrich our nation and our local community thank you very much comments well I really appreciate I remember back when I moved to Oregon in 1990 and worked for my first private firm here and uh they",

        "text": " other part to answer the question is how it fits in the climate action plan in many ways this is one of the early opportunities for everybody in but most everybody in Salem to say I'm involved in the climate action plan because I'm contributing this amount becomes an individual participation opportunity less so than what are they doing else which would be an interesting exercise to see how many people do partipate and if I could add one one note on that you know it's it's think about this both in terms of the things that you can do to just sort of Simply reduce the city's emissions on a you know metric tons basis and then also things you can do to benefit your community overall like you know this is there's a combination like does a project where you put solar panels on top of a fire station and also batteries in the basement um reduce emissions absolutely it also provides really significant resiliency benefits uh for your community in the event of a major outage whether it's caused by um a big earthquake or an ice storm or whatever else um you know we PGE provides really significant uptime um but it's not perfect and it can't be just because of the climate and other um environmental risks that we all face um so that's a spot where you know maybe you can go to your community and say this is going to increase your bill by two bucks a month or whatever the number is going to be it will help us you know get closer to our climate goals and also provide the significant benefit to our community overall regardless of the climate benefits I think that's a really great that's a really great Point Riley and um and mayor you're well aware that City of Salem has the First Community micro grid um and that's an excellent example of a partnership as well as serving the has a larger role in serving the community because it does serve your Public Works which is your emergency Operation Center in case of a significant event so it has multiple benefits um and in that in in that micro GD it also is serving um a small number of customers um but but I appreciate that Riley brought up that that we can certainly have conversations about what makes sense for your community in terms of a pro small scale project great thank you Wendy for that context I think like something that just came to mind we could do another micro grid maybe at our airport in ass with a solar a solar farm out there and then because we know that in the event of the Cascadia our airport could become really a critical asset that we need to keep up and running yep exactly that's exactly right so then it's it has a resiliency aspect it has an economic aspect so it's like multiple benefits to the entire Community great I guess my my last question if I could is one of the challenges as we kind of wrestle with this is the difference between net metering and selling power back PGE for facility so so for example you know at the airport we could put in some solar it be net metered and that would reduce the the airport's overall cost for their electricity but we're not then contributing to the overall grid that's really just a reduction to sale and it's not a CommunityWide benefit whereas a larger facility then would sell directly to PG it would be a net metering operation that's right and there are you know um uh there are statutory limits on how big a n metering facility can be that significantly reduce the actually there might be regulatory requirements I have to check um but either way there are limitations on how big in that Ming facility can be and sort of you know how that can serve to offset any particular um facilities um usage um and I think that could potentially be part of the solution um but it by itself can't be um you know full disclosure some of you may have seen in some media coverage that we have been talking about changes to our net metering program um that sort of that work is also in my shop it sort of paused for the moment I just want to flag that because that just came up and I don't want to not mention it as a current net metor metering customer with solar panels on my roof I definitely am paying attention to that well good well mayor I can guarant guantee you that whatever we do will not change the deal you have right now we are not looking at Mak making retrospective changes at all great good to know thank you I want to make sure everybody has a chance to get all of their questions answered whether it's committee members or staff so if anybody has questions please Now's the Time because I think this is a really important kind of foundational conversation on whether we're even going to go down this road you know that's uh that's why we asked PG to be here just kind of get our make sure our understanding level of this program is is uh established so we can even talk about whether or not we want to have this conversation uh because that's you know certainly something you know we've been talking a few of us have been talking with Wendy about but it's it's you know it's fairly complex and so now is a great time to get those questions answered if you haven't so I want to check in online with councelor Phillips or councelor Gonzalez make sure that you're having an opportunity to have questions thank you mayor and definitely a lot to take in great information but no questions yeah thank you counselor councelor Phillips are you good um I mean I probably have questions I I I just may not be able to phrase them right now um I mean I guess like what I'm looking for is like a sense of scale in comparison to the goals that we as the City of Salem have has set as our um aspirational you know Targets in terms of um you know reducing the carbon emissions that we're doing um and what is needed to actually move the needle um so you know like getting a sense of perspective and then broadly speaking my question would be like what are the deadlines I mean I I think what hearing I'll paraphrase what I think I'm hearing is that this is an opportunity to partner um uh with our our local stakeholder in providing energy uh to go above and beyond what PG is already going to do they've got their own targets that are um set by the state of Oregon um but we can now go above and beyond so just like a sense of scale uh and then a sense of like are there deadlines like when do when do we need to make this decision yeah thank you councelor for that I would just add on to that kind of compound that question a little bit because I'm curious about this kind of conversation about uh scalability or compounding like if we start small what does that look like to build you know if we enter into like maybe just a very small discreet program to begin with what does that look like if it you know this proves to be popular or whatever how how do we scale that up so I'm I'm curious we can hear from PGE about what the councelor asking maybe also my question on top U those are really great questions I'll go with counselor Phil's questions first and then I'll go to your question mayor um so to answer your question very directly councelor Phillips there is no deadline um you know we're building a program that can be opted into by a community more or less at any time we will probably have some timing suggestions um relative to when you would want to start something to sort of match what other resource procurements we might be doing um but you know it's not to say that you have to do this by 2028 or something like that um and then to your question of scale um remind me what Salem's um what what Salem's number is and and when uh 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and okay carbon neutral by 2050 okay that's helpful um so you know we can take that and we can say okay well you know what's what's needed on a megawatt hour basis to do that um and I don't know off the top of my head but it would be relatively is well it wouldn't be straightforward to figure it out but we could get to a um and then we would simply say okay well you know what's PGE going to be doing already you know what percentage of your city's electricity in 2035 will be carbon free um or will be renewable and then what's the incremental amount we would need to do on top of that um that's something that we'd have to go take back and do some math um but that's how we would figure it out thank you I guess I thought of a question that might not be related but like I guess is there an opportunity for us locally to incentivize like private residences to move towards solar in this or is that kind of a separate route from this no it absolutely is and and that's something we've been discussing um with in terms of our our net metering program program um and changes we're talking about making to it we do see a program like this as an opportunity for um communities that aren't Portland that don't have the Portland clean energy fund um to create a pot of money that could be used for a similar purpose um so so yes like could some of this money go to reduce the cost of like a solar Plus Storage for um um for residential customers in the City of Salem absolutely you know that's the kind of thing where we need we can have discussions about that in the participation agreement stage but this program is designed to create options around that kind of thing thank you that's that was a great question counselor that help me understand that a little bit better as well so I appreciate that I anybody have questions any members of the public have questions that we don't normally do that but things like we have people from uh home builders and chamber and folks who might have questions so I U I think one of the areas with the most known unknowns and unknown unknowns is the whole category of risk allocation people identifying the risk allocation the balance between what PGE takes as a risk and what the city takes as a risk you said one of the ways to address that is to start small uh several times you talked about I think you said a 20year agreement is that just your thought that you know locking the two agencies into a 20-y year agreement or a seveny year agreement or a 10 year agreement",

        "text": " 20 minutes or so so we really welcome to add additional actions that are relevant to including externalities so an example of the social cost of carbon could conceptually in that in that train of thought and again this is just an example you can actually see this example on the web page that was shared in the chat and it's also been in other materials such as the two-pager that's available on the ticker project so hopefully that helped clarify some of those initial big picture the the draft actions are across all sectors so even though you know energy efficiency is one action related to the energy sector there's you know there's a series of potential actions i think we have approximately close to 100 across sectors that can be considered for the modeling and then later on in the suggested and then we also have a couple of questions that have come up since thanks for answering that one that are more about the process but there's also one that's about our presentation which is just a reminder to speak slowly that's for both of us maya um so um one is what is the time at time frame for commenting on this initial process yes thank you for the question and thank you for the reminder um so that we have the portal that we hope to have comments for this first part of the process um by december 16th we will be taking comments throughout the the entire project um to develop the roadmap so you can feel free to you know always add comments as you think of them but we'll be checking them as snapshots so for example december 16 comments will be used to help inform this task too which is to really firm up the draft list of actions to be modeled but there will be you know really additional parts of the process for example the co-benefits analysis and there'll be many other opportunities both through stakeholder meetings the global warming um and snapshots when we will be bundling up public comments um for those unless i'm mistaken i think they um public comments are due the 13th you're correct thank you kathy for that yeah you're welcome so if you think of this as a staged process you know the first stage is to get the list so we want comments on that and this was ostensibly what this meeting and tomorrow's meeting are about is to help look at the list and get new ideas from from stakeholders in the public and then also working on the co-benefits at the same time but that's kind of the next step that'll uh and then do the modeling to get to the development of these mac curves and then the final step is to kind of mesh the co-benefits analysis and the economic analysis together that will help us rejigger this mac curve not just based on economic analysis economics but based on cost and benefits but also the co-benefits that are associated with different actions so that will be the task of the global warming commission to then meld those together and come up with the final list which would then build that will meet our greenhouse gas emission goals and that will be the road map to 2035. so this is a stage process and we'll have this done final part of the global warming commission will be the second half of and we'll be done with this project at the end of february 2023 great that actually answered the other question that we had from helen thank you for the great process questions helen and then finally for anyone who joined after that we're having folks introduce themselves if they're representing an organization to say so and then to say um i believe in particularly uh in particular what um what brought you here today to this conversation and so i really appreciate i've been reading them and it's been really great to see familiar faces and names and then also new ones and really cool things that you all are doing around the state so thanks for being here and with that i don't see any other um questions in the chat so i think we could now be ready to move excellent thank you again i will stop sharing and pass it over to chris at ssg great thanks maya you just uh just go on everybody see my screen yeah yeah all right perfect great um thanks everybody um i appreciate it so uh my name is chris drasick i'm one of the consultants working on this project i'm an energy systems modeler and i've been modeling various energy energy systems and services for the last 20 years and i've been a great pleasure to work with uh with the team here on this project and we're looking forward to getting uh getting some great feedback from from from you all and you know behalf of me and my colleagues working on this project uh yeah we welcome you um so uh i'll pass it over to naomi to gotta get us kicked kick started and talk about the process and then i'll jump into kind of going over uh some of the the more technical details of this fantastic hi everyone can you hear me okay chris yep just to check wonderful uh great great to see you all here thanks very much for the introductions in the chat too it helps to get to know you a bit better as well so for today we're going to spend the next 15 minutes on a presentation to take you through the modeling process and thank you for the reminder to slow down i definitely hail from scottish people who speak way too fast so i'll do my best to slow down but also please don't hesitate to put a note in the chat and penny or chris will remind me that i've gone too fast so presentation on the modeling process to get you acquainted with um how we've gotten to the actions that we have to date and what sort of looks like um going forward uh on and then a presentation on action development which sort of rounds out um that process then we're going to do an activity together in miro so we'll share the link to that at the time and we'll we'll take you through that so that everyone has a moment to adjust um to that uh platform if you haven't used it before in order to gather your input and we're going to go section by section um through the actions that are either currently planned or new uh to get your feedback as was mentioned by alan previously in maya to you know take a look at the list and see if anything is missing and what else should we should be adding and we will wrap up with next steps next slide that's great and so specifically what we're here to do today is understand the project process and how you can be involved both as today and it's a stepped process moving forward understand how actions themselves are understand the parameterization super fun word uh process for actions so the additional detail that goes into the thinking there we'll talk more about that as well and we want to receive input on additional new actions in case anything is missing what we're not here to do today is decide on the final list of actions to be modeled and we're not here to parameterize uh the actions um today as well so the output of today's meeting for us will be a list of additional actions to consider for modeling let's take a look at the modeling process so back to chris thanks naomi um so a couple slides here to give kind of a big picture on the the model that we're using and the process that we're going through to lay some context on how we're def how we need to define the actions or how the actions kind of fit into as inputs into into the model so we're using the systems dynamics model and you can see from this big spaghetti mess of of links and nodes we're uh it's a the idea to show that this is an integrate one integrated model we're not using a whole bunch of different models that don't speak to each other and and don't have interaction as best as we can we're modeling all of the different energy systems um within within the state of oregon and these are all interconnected in the ways that are meaningful um so you can see that from you know the demographics drive and ultimately drive the energy use um and they influence land use so you've been putting more people on the land you're changing the land use from forester agriculture and vice versa if you're taking people off that landing you can be you know reconverting it back the buildings that we use you know how the buildings are built so on and so forth so this is all the captured and connected in ways that we can understand and quantify and in them in this process so all of these are built out of uh stocks and flows which i'll get to in a to reiterate what was touched on earlier so we're looking at really addressing kind of this green part here so the integration of the actions is an important concept because the way that we order and the way that and the actions that we add again because we're using an integrated systems dynamics model they'll impact or influence each other so as the question the first question that was brought up if you uh we can do an action that reduces the amount of energy used as well as transition to a different source of energy and those will interact with each other because then it will by reducing the amount of energy that you require in a building for example lessen the burden or the load of the energy that you need to produce and so therefore maybe possibly making it easier to to generate you know a greener source of energy going forward so all of these all of these actions interact and stack on top of each other to get us down to this decarbonization pathway or pathways that we're going to be exploring as part of this project we're also going to be looking at the data spatially so we're going to be modeling all of the different at the county level um and so oregon obviously as you all know is a very diverse uh place so you know the west is quite different from the east the north is quite different from the south so try and understand how these differences impact the amount of energy that we use and the way that we use it is important for this not only from an energy point of view for for looking at the co-benefits and equity kind of aspects of of energy and how how energy and emissions are generated within the state so all of the data that we're collecting all of the all of the the the information that we're generating is going to be county specific to be able to see kind of what the impacts of what the differences between the counties are and to be able to",

        "text": " really did pursue the CPU to make sure we had the maximum flexibility be because we felt like a lot of the current projects especially the snitcher one just up the hill from us they're subduing that up into smaller parcels and smaller sizes and we really feel like doing a bigger box is going to be more opportunity for companies like lamb research and others to come into the market where they that availability doesn't really exist right now so that's kind of where we went that direction we don't have a tenant um identified but we have equity and we have interested parties who believe in this market and this project and in this city and feel like it's a good investment so we're speculatively um which is not something a lot of people are doing right now so that just lets you know our confidence and our excitement to be in this market so I just wanted to share that with you um any questions on that before I uh no I'll just ask my question because we have the option for conditional use for support services to go along with it and I just always I just thought it was interesting that you chose not to do any of the accessory support services that would have been allowed with the building just seemed like one cup to cover it all but we're didn't didn't want to pursue an extra no no make it more complicated right right well we feel with the uses allowed in the EI we we will find a tenant for this building um and again like staff mentioned uh with the the size of the building and getting the U distribution warehouse it opens up that that Avenue we you know we're hoping for manufacturing to bring in more jobs to the community um but we wanted to keep our uh options okay okay um so I'll present the set that we submitted so as as staff presented this is our design of the building um since um tonen is the arterial Frontage Road and we're so far from it almost 200 feet and and over 75 ft above it we had our design focused on to Commerce which would be um the way to access the building and a site so that's where a lot of our entry design and Frontage Focus um as was put um the site plan as as presented um we do have trailer parking uh on the uh Northwest uh triangular parcel um with our water treatment area I'm Commerce and then um our building uh with all of the loading um and trailers parked to the South which is away from uh Commerce Court which myself I'm I'm considering the frontage or arterial although it's not really but since that's where the access is um again we wanted to keep our design Focus um from that Viewpoint off of Commerce um if you have any questions while I'm going through this please uh feel free to uh interrupt me um this our I have one since you asked we said we can interrupt so your design focus is from that Commerce Court right there but this pretty elevated like you say pretty tall building it's going to be I think it's be visible more broadly probably from Murdoch and Oregon Street all that as well did you consider that too or is it going to be blocked by trees mostly or yes and I'll I'll jump to the uh site sections that staff had had uh presented um these are hard to see at this scale but we did do a number of studies along tonquin um of how much you would see of the building and um let me go back to our side elevation which is difficult to see on here as well but there's a dash line that goes through the upper Windows of our building anything above that dash line is what we feel is going to be visible um based on those site studies and that's without taking into consideration any of the existing vegetation that's going to remain along that slope or any new vegetation that will be planted along that slope but that's from tonin Road from tonin Road right but the orientation of the building to tonin is then a large green space area and that visual Corridor goes all the way down to uh Oregon Street so people driving down Oregon Street are going to be looking up the hill I think is what commissioner bble to see it pretty clearly um yes um which is awkward I I understand because it's it's not in our code to say can you address something 400 feet away that it is I don't disagree with that although I have been in the neighborhood that's to the West I I don't feel it's going to be visible from the neighborhood um there's so many trees um between uh the neighborhood and this building from from Oregon Street possibly yes um but we want our building to be seen so I'm not worried about that it's the fact that we did not meet the design guideline criteria for the for the glass uh percentage of glass required as facing arterial because you won't be able to see that glass because it's it's down low on the building so a quick question just to add on that looking through the packet I know there was we've got the visual ideas there are no V visual simulations done prep okay I saw I saw the colored elevations you did make an effort to reduce the scale and massing by doing articulation yes yes so and I can speak to the to the entry so we have a twostory glass um with some vertical fenestrations um canopies at all the all the entries and let me go to the um site plan here we are making this into a multi-tenant building the capabilities we may have one user we could have up to four users in this building so we do have the the enhanced entries um at four locations on the building um I'm going to flip over the Civil plans um um which to see if you have any questions on any of uh anything for engineering that we that we can answer um again the uh the storm Pond is located on the the Northwest parcel um that'll be landscaped I didn't include the landscape plans in our presentation um but they are in your packet I guess I I guess I looked at the Landscaping if I can ask questions and was concern that um there was only 5% of evergreen trees and um we we have seasons here and so they're going to lose all their leaves and we're going to have large swath of truck parking that's going to be visible and I was wondering about um looking at the screening through through that area and on the west side of the property to have a little bit more of the evergreen trees that would eventually provide um a green greencape year round through that um sure I don't think we would object to that um St do you have any comments on the the Landscaping that we've proposed versus uh what commission recommending yeah yeah so one of the criteria um was uh kind of requires 5% of landscaping to be dedicated as Evergreen um I think that it was notated that the preliminary Landscaping is indicated only 3.8% so we conditioned it to be 5% um it sounds like the commission would like to maybe kind of um potentially require additional um Evergreen Landscaping potentially tied to the cup maybe I I would say that because well I don't know I don't know what is truck parking is a use how is that a use in our code Park I don't see it defined so I don't we have one lot or two lots that we're doing one application for and distribution and warehousing is the one lot and then the other lot is truck parking so I don't know that use is if that is part of the cup and if it's part of the cup I think for um I see it for two things one is for screening for the people driving by but it's also light mitigation that Creek Corridor is needs to be protected from light pollution and I see you have a photometric um example that's provided but that I mean still going to be light into the creek where the animals are going to be going through and so if we have evergreen trees that would help mitigate that I just at this time what we have proposed and it may not be represented accurately in this packet is wall our lighting would be wall packs on the building at this point we don't have any like parking lot lighting planned in that back truck court that um or do we have any Street lighting or Lighting on the truck Court in the upper northwest corner there's going to be Street Lighting on Commerce Street which we would think would be adequate to cover that truck Court area at the same time so this time we're not proposing any additional lighting besides what's required for the building itself okay cuz I so I misunderstood this red blob as being a lot of light there I know it would just be we we looking at this the street the public Street thinking it's going to have lighting so why we need to go beyond that knowing and also for the truck sitting up high and against that's also why we put the trucks against the street is to keep them away from the critical areas so let and keep it uphill so to speak okay to clarify you said truck but you mean trailers sorry so trailer we're just parking trailers there and so when the vehicle when the truck comes in thank and so that's when we're going to have the visual screening and typically I'd say distribution between the hours of 4 to 5: in the morning they're hooking up and they're going to be trailering out of there right of the yeah it just depends on the tenant in the use which we don't know at this time so given and I think to Gan to commissioner Sim's Point here is that area while not delineated by the esa report as a significant area does provide and will provide additional habitat and whatnot so I think given the proximity to Rock Creek the addition of Evergreens um at greater than 5 perc is something that the commission would be backing would it be fair to say that the that or another way to clarify would be to put the five make sure that the 5% is in that specific area can we frame it that way that we it's not getting being buried in a different corner or away from the sensitive areas that would be up to your landscape engineer depending on you know the density and holding carrying capacity of that area um yeah it would be nice it would also be nice to have a a staggered or kind of Sero approach to you're adding a pond feature and I'll talk about that in my next comment but it seems like you have an opportunity here not to just throw vegetation at it but to actually engineer it",

        "text": " can actually fill out a survey specific to that region and so we have the sample size summarized in this map it ranges between seven on the low end 11 on the high end in the wamit valley the sample size is 11 and we had about 50% response rate from the the utilities so 20 of those 41 did fill out our survey important to note that the three IUS did complete the survey for us and so we have our actual sample size in this map with the pie charts um on the low end is four high end is nine which is in the lamet valley so you guys were on the higher end and then here we have our final vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix so we have the regions across the top and the threats across the side and I'm just going to highlight a few key takeaways from this Matrix first of all our electric um utilities most often prioritize four threads first was Cyber attack and then we had those three threats that we highlighted earlier that keep rising to the top so Wildfire wind storm and winter storm we have a number of threats highlighted here or or outlined in boxes these are on the higher um end across the different regions and they're largely driven by exposure and impacts and so for the wamit valley you can see that for flood wildfire and Windstorm relative to some of these other regions your score for exposure and impact would have been higher Portland metro drought this one was driven largely by adap adaptive capacity so from that you can deduce that your adaptive capacity was Stronger relative to the Portland metro area specific to drought and then with the human cause threats there are several things that I want to highlight for you first of all this feedback is really dominated by the smaller utilities so while we did get um surveys completed by the IUS they actually gave us no information or very limited information I should say for human cause threats for Cyber attack and physical attack so this is really um strongly representative of the smaller utilities these results um across these the the higher rankings are largely driven by exposure impact and you'll notice that there are four responses that are in gold and are underlined they all have a value of two they're in the eastern and Portland metro regions and these scores are artificially low so we actually got no feedback from any of the utilities related to potential impact of these human cost threats for those two regions so had we had a value for impact we know that the total score would have been higher and so we know that those scores are are lower than they would be and then finally you might notice that we have little variability across the regions for a given threat so if you look at a specific threat um or I'm sorry if you look at a specific region and you can see that each of the threats there's quite a bit of variability there but across the regions it's more consistent and so what we can do is identify where the variability Lies by digging into the nuances of the data a little bit more and this is why I want to give you some information on adaptive capacity so I'm going to walk you through how we structured adaptive capacity in the survey please don't be overwhelmed by this slide you do not have to study it it is referenced in your handout the key takeaway from this is that what we we did is we gave five categories of mitigation measures to the utilities specific to Cyber attack and those categories are identify protect detect respond and recover what this table gives you is some examples of what those different categories look like so you can have a clear understanding of what would fall in each of those categories so you can reference those in your hand up if you'd like there's one similar to this that's specific to physical threats as well so we give this table to the and we ask them to tell us their maturity rating with regard to implementing these types of measures so on the lower end of maturity we would have evolving and this is where they're just now getting the document in place it's not very well integrated yet midlevel maturity would be embedding that's where they're really integrating this measure into their business processes their procedures and then optimizing is when they're really considered to be a leader in their field with regard to implementing that type of mitigation measure and so what we're going to see moving forward is a color scheme for the Adaptive capacity slides where lighter shades of teal and orange represent a lower level of maturity and the deeper shades of teal and orange represent the highest level of maturity optimizing and so what we can do is we can organize all of this data and summarize it in some figures so what we have in these bar charts is Cyber attack on the left and physical attack on the right and you can see those darker shades of teal um being reported across each of these five categories for these two different threats and then you can see um some reporting that they're embedding so that midlevel and then that lightest shade of teal we see it for identify and respond under the Cyber attack and so what we're looking for we're training our eye to go to those areas where the lightest shades are present because what that does is it um illustrates an opportunity for growth right so what it's less mature there's more opportunity to mature the implementation of that measure and so in general you might say that identify and respond and I'm sorry identify detect and respond all have more opportunity for growth specific to Cyber attack relative to the other measures and relative to physical attack so that's areas where we might want to invest maturing those measures so we can take the similar approach for natural Hazard um mitigation measures and so here we're looking at the phys category of measures and these are specific to Wildfire in your region so we have Harden this could be something like applying a fire resistant coating redundancy you know having something like a backup power source remove actually taking that infrastructure out of the hazard zones upgrade maybe have a water pump and you're going to increase the efficiency of that pump and then weather eyes adding something like storm windows and so we can see here now we're looking at the orange color for the natural hazard and again we're training our ey to look for those lighter Shades and so you can see there's opportunity for growth across all of these categories um potentially remove and and weatherize might have the most opportunity here our last grouping of measures would be operational measures specific to Natural hazards and so here we have continuity of operation plans so this is making sure business continue operations can continue under different circumstances with have Emergency Operations plan you know identifying the roles of different people different entities emergency response plan what are the steps we're going to follow in an emergency due to different threats and the Integrity safety plans so we're assessing and mitigating the risks specific to threats and then finally we have situational awareness so obviously understanding what's going on during an emergency and so again we're training our eye to look at those um lighter Shades and there's pretty good opportunity across all five of these categories perhaps situational awareness would be the the most mature um category of measures here specific to Wildfire in region so what I'm going to be doing is giving you guys snapshots of some of the results where we saw the highest opportunity for growth and so quickly on on this slide just a quick summary we have physical measures on the left operational measures on the right the top left is the Cascadia event and the bottom left is wind storm so you you can see um weather eyes and perhaps remove have some of these lower um ratings for maturity for the Cascadia event and then for Windstorm um kind of the same you have upgrade weather eyes Harden so you know looking for those lighter Shades operational measures on the top you have Cascadia on the top right and then Windstorm operational measures on the bottom right and um you know quite a bit of opportunity for growth across all of those one thing I will point out is that for um Cascadia situational awareness did tend to have some lower reporting for situational awareness specifically so this is where we want to do another check-in so the same questions you answered last time for stakeholder engagement we wanting to understand with question nine what resonates with you so what you're seeing do you agree with it you want to say yes affirm you're on the right track question 10 anything you disagree with something that doesn't seem quite right to you or that you want to just put on our radar so that we're tuning into it so give you a minute to answer these two questions and answer any questions that anyone has yeah please go ahead so um I have to say I'm very impressed it's uh it's obviously had a lot of work gone into it um but I have a question about how you have the interaction between the different utilities you you categorized each one of the utilities and what they're doing but how is the overarching integrated policy being addressed so for example uh one of the concerns we have in V is that the existing leeber Dam and hydroelectric plant is planned to be removed uh we recently had P winter storm which took out a lot of the power lines and also took out one power at the time that it have so the proposal is that um the B power butons supply power for the region so if the Leber generating capacity is no longer there we've lost a lot of flexibility due to operational interpretations by e um for commercial reasons they decided that's the best way to go but in terms of the risk mitigation it's hold the Dynamics enormously we' also was using dynamite and V power lines recently which got everyone's attention um but it does speak to what you're addressing in as much as Bad actors can do things like that uh we've got so much exposure to very long power lines coming down from P so how is that added so the question is how are we addressing are you talking about the the interdependencies again yes is I mean there's there's definitely an interdependency I guess you guys are the experts on this but it's my understanding that there are only two um of the utilities that actually generate their own power and the rest buy income so obviously if something happens to one of the two generators it's going to have a different impact something happening to someone who receiv might be able to um just so I think I understand your your question and the issue with the I got your um the concept being kind of fre frame what you pointed out is um eweb uh makes a choice to not",

        "text": "all right good afternoon everyone it's about 202 so we'll get started and i'll stall for a little bit in the beginning here to give people an opportunity to sign on thank you so much for joining us for the oregon department of energy's public hearing on our application to the us department of energy's grid resilience for those of you i haven't met my name is jeannine benner and i'm the director of the oregon department of energy today's meeting is to specifically discuss a program created in the infrastructure investment and jobs act under section 40101 d this is different from the request for information put out yesterday by the us department of energy that's for additional funding that will be made available for similar activities to strengthen the country's electric grid but that's beyond the scope of our discussion this afternoon because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance we have everyone muted currently but as we go through the presentation we'll pause for questions and at that point we'll be able to unmute individuals to ask questions i'm going to jump ahead to talk about the agenda in just a moment but as i do i would ask odo staff who are on the call to please introduce yourselves in the chat and next slide please so for those of you who are new to webex here's a quick guide on how to use some of the features as i mentioned before attendees are going to be off camera and muted but our host will be able to unmute you if we call on you to ask a question you'll see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under participants panel if you click near your name you should get the opportunity to raise your hand and there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar so feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments when you do that make sure to send to all panelists or everyone so that all of the oto staff can see it and help respond if you just send it to the host uh it's hard for the one staff person who's the host to be able to see everything and we'll try to get to as many questions in the chat as we can and through raised hands but we may not have time for all of them i noticed that some people have called it on the phone if you have and you would like to ask a question you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when we call on you and the host done meets you from our end i want to make sure that you know that today's hearing is being recorded and we also plan to post a list of attendees to our website later today because i know it's hard to see the other people who are in attendance all right next slide please we have a lot to get through today in our two hours together here is the for the first part of today's meeting we're going to be focusing on the grid resilience funding opportunity in the infrastructure investment and jobs act the way that congress and the us department of energy have structured the program and the requirements for the oregon department of energy on behalf of the state to submit an my colleague jen center who is our federal grants officer will be leading this part of the presentation the second part will be information about the state's approach to our my co colleague adam schultz who is the lead of our electricity group and the planning and innovation division will be speaking about the specifics of the oregon program and finally towards the end of the agenda we will look for your feedback on the state's approach and i'll say again we'll stop and ask for questions during the presentation and you're welcome to ask them and put questions in the chat but please know that many of your questions will probably be answered as we go through the material so you may also want to save them to the end my colleague ruchi sedir associate director for strategic engagement will be helping to keep an eye on the chat as we go through the presentation and finally my colleague stacey is our host today and she'll be helping to keep an eye open for questions as well all right next slide please so before we jump in a quick introduction to the oregon department of energy or odo as you might hear us referred to on this slide you will see our vision mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable energy transition protect the environment of public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future under what we do you'll see the services that we provide the funding opportunity that we're discussing today will help odo support a resilient convertible next slide please okay so we have four key objectives for our time together today first we want to make sure that you understand how this grid resilience funding works and the parameters that we have to work within when designing the state's program is a huge opportunity to bring federal dollars to oregon to help make our electric grid more resilient second we want to share with you our approach for this funding and what we're planning to put in our application to this approach has been developed over the past two months in close consultation with the oregon public utility commission and is formed informed by some initial outreach with experts working in this space i um i think that i may you may hear some feedback from uh my microphone and i apologize for that i'm literally having uh resilient solar panels installed on my roof today we've been waiting to do this for a while and the installers are finally here and i'm sitting right under the place where they're installing solar panels so i apologize for the feedback and i'm going to be turning it over to a colleague soon so um hopefully you'll be able to hear better but i'll just get through this uh this slide which is to talk about our our objectives today uh and this is our opportunity in addition to sharing information to hear from you on the program design and application and to get your ideas for how to improve it now remember the draft proposal that we're sharing with you today is literally just that it's a draft we want your input and feedback to make it better to align with work already being done by utilities and others and to better meet the objectives outlined in the federal funding as i mentioned earlier we will have some time for verbal public comments at the end and we also hope people will submit written comments through our online portal if you don't want to today or you don't get a chance to speak or if you have more to finally you'll hear today that our approach to this federal funding is in phases this is a five-year program and we're proposing a preliminary approach for year one and the launch of a conversation about more permanent objectives criteria and metrics for years two through five all right next slide please now i will turn it over to gen center to talk about this federal funding yes the federal funding opportunity that we have before us today comes to us through the infrastructure investment and jobs act and under the infrastructure investment and jobs act you can see that it provides 62 billion for the u.s department of energy to devel deliver a more equitable clean energy future for the american people by investing in american manufacturing and workers expanding access to energy efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more americans and building the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations this is just part of the suite of funding opportunities that come to us from the infrastructure investment and jobs act included in that we also are anticipating funds through the state energy program funds through energy efficiency programs including a revolving loan fund and energy efficiency and conservation block grant programs in addition to those funds the state of oregon is anticipating receiving approximately 30 million dollars in weatherization activities that will be run through the oregon housing and community services agency the oregon department of transportation is also anticipating roughly 50 million dollars to invest in the construction of electrical vehicle charging stations the program we'll be discussing today relates to resilience and reliability so that is approximately 50 million dollars to the state of oregon um over a five-year time period um in addition to that there may be competitive opportunities to assist with workforce program training opportunities related to energy auditors and building codes but today our focus of this public hearing is all about the opportunity before us related on resilience and reliability to the electric grid overall we're working on establishing guiding priorities based on feedback that we received in july to help us as we direct the investments under all of these different opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act i want to start by thanking those who took the time to participate in either one of those two webinars or provided your information through the comment portal we're working through that um at this time to come up with our our guiding priorities although it's not finalized we do recognize that under the iija funds it will be important for us to consider equity at every step to facilitate regular communication and to provide technical assistance to build both community capacity and support grant recipients these are the some of the priorities we've applied in the development of this proposed grant narrative that we'll be discussing today and they will be reflected even further as we move forward in future years under this program so at this time i'd like to pause to find out if we happen to have any questions that may have come in so far or if anyone has their hands raised no questions in the chat so far jen all right we'll go ahead and move along so the funding opportunity that brings us here today and the purpose of these funds as outlined by the u.s department of energy is to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events it's also to generate the greatest community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of those and to advance the department of energy's equity environmental and energy justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative in pursuit of all that it provides opportunities to invest in the american a little bit of timing information regarding this opportunity um for the application that opened up on july 6th and we've been working on preparing the proposed narrative that we'll be going over in depth today but our application will be due to the u.s department of energy on september and just to clarify that the oregon department of energy will be the entity um the agency for the state that applies receives and administer",

now on the way out will you will you present or will you uh promote the applicant to be panelist I thank you okay can you also yeah uh it would be Ryan oh yeah I see Ryan too now Ryan David and Sarah is what I was what I gathered cool all right well I think that we can get started with this uh information meeting tonight um let's see slide okay good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for the wagon trail solar project complete application for site certificate virtual information meeting uh the department intended to be hosting this meeting tonight in person um but because of weather had to change plans we do take attending meetings in person seriously and uh at the next opportunity to to host a meeting which will be at the draft proposed order public hearing we will be in person it's actually uh a rule that we need to be hosting that in person so you will see us in person at the next opportunity um in the process step before I get too far ahead of myself my name is Chase McVey Walker I am a senior sighting Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy um I'm joined tonight I Believe by my colleagues Todd cornette Sarah esterson omit Carr and Nancy hatch do we have any actually I see well I'll ask do we have any council members uh attending tonight I see council uh council member Katy is President oh council member Imes awesome well thank you both for joining us tonight really appreciate it and T you do have Anne buer on the line also uh attending virtually and I unmuted your mic thank you and thank you for hosting this yes thank you both for for attending really appreciate it the applicant for the wagon trail solar project is Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC and I see that they are also here tonight um we have David Lawler Ryan Hill and Sarah twitchell and uh before I go into my presentation further I just want to go over a few uh Logistics the meeting tonight will be record recorded and it will be posted to the wagon trail solar project project web page along with a copy of the presentation slides the present the presentation slides actually are already uploaded and uh available on the wagon trail solar web page I will show a link to the project web page later in this presentation for those that want to write a Down or don't know where it is after I provide an overview of the energy facility sighting Council process the applicant team will describe the proposed facility and then following their presentation we'll open up the meeting to a Q&amp;A session and I ask to I ask you to uh please hold on to questions and comments until we get to that portion of the okay well I just kind of went over it but tonight's presentation will provide an overview of the steps in the energy facility sighting Council review process and will highlight opportunities for public participation in the the and that's what I will I'll provide that overview then I'll hand over the presentation to the applicant team to provide an overview of the proposed facility and we'll close out the meeting with a Q&amp;A session this is when the public will have an opportunity to ask questions about the proposed facility as well as the FC review okay the Oregon Department of Energy's sighting division has one primary objective to review large scale energy projects for compliance with appli appable standards and rules for reference citing refers to the technical permitting review of a proposed energy facility against a number of predetermined standards and I'll go into a little bit more of this in a couple slides um based on site specific locational issues that may be affected by a particular facility please note that l land Acquisitions land leases and easements are all outside of the FC review process the Oregon Department of Energy's sighting division serves as staff to the energy facility sighting Council which I will uh also at times refer to as the council or FC the council consists of up to seven members serving in a volunteer capacity council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate and represent diverse professional backgrounds from across the state when Odo citing staff makes recommendations to council Council itself is the final decision-making Authority for energy facilities under their jurisdiction including this project The Wagon Trail solar project this slide represents or illustrates the seven major steps in the review process of applications for site certificates the first step here the first Chevron is the notice of intent phase or step and this is when the the applicant States their intention to submit an application for a site certificate and generally includes information general information about the project this is functionally the applicants conceptual plan the information in the noi uh allows reviewing agencies including local governments and the public to identify applicable requirements and special issues of concern the applicant must address in their application the second step in the process is the project order and the project order defines the analysis area for various types of impacts and ident and identifies the applicable statutes rules ordinances that the applicant must address in the application um the third step which is where we are now um and it's highlighted here with the red box is the application or the application for site certificate and oh excuse me okay the application which is where we are tonight um this step is where the applicant describes the facility its anticipated impacts and provides information to prove that they meet all of the standards I'd like to emphasize that we're currently at this step the third step in the process um and that at this step there's no public comment period associated with the step however when we get to the next step in the process when the Department issues the draft proposed order um there will be a public comment period And as well as a public hearing now let's see following well as I just explain the next step in the process is the draft proposed order and generally the draft proposed order is the Oregon Department of Energy's initial findings of fact and conclusions of law as well as recommendations to counil on whether or not the facility would comply with all of the applicable requirements and I'll get into a little more detail about the draft proposed order in a couple slides following the DPO or draft proposed order um the department would issue the proposed order and this proposed order issuance of the proposed order follows the draft proposed order hearing and uh also follows the energy facility sighting council's review of the draft proposed order and based on the direction from Council the Department issues the proposed order and a notice of contested the proposed order is staff's revised recommendation based on comments received comments received from the council comments received from the public from the applicant just comments received the second to last step in this process is the contested case step and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing um or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft proposed order May participate in the contested case step uh the contested case process step is run by an independent uh hearing officer and following the conclusion of the contested case step would be fex review of the proposed order um and review of the if there is contested case review of the hearing officer's recommended contested case order and they Council would following that review would issue a final order either approving or denying the application for a site certificate the final orders finding of facts and conclusions of law are based on the proposed order and the outcome of the contested case if the council approves the application the council issues a site certificate which is uh effectively a okay the next two slides I have here uh provide an overview of the the timeline the schedule associated with this particular project The Wagon Trail solar project as you can see the department uh received the notice of intent on November 3rd 2020 and then uh issued a project order and an amended project order uh in March 20 on March 23rd 2021 and then August 17 2021 the department received the preliminary application for site certificate from the applicant in August of 2022 and uh it's not represented here but I would like to just clarify is the department uh determined that the application was complete in December of 2023 and then following that determination on January 3rd of this year 2024 the department received the complete application from the applicant and now the next couple steps um the last line item in this table on this Slide the draft proposed order issuance by the department um our forecast is to have that issued in February um and although that's subject to change but that's our forecast now the next couple steps the DPO hearing if issued in February we anticipate would occur in person in March and that would be followed by council's review of the DPO um forecasted to be in April and following council's review of we would forecast um the proposed order being issued also in April with a contested case period spanning the remainder of April ail and into May um and if all forecasting goes according to plan uh Council would then uh review the proposed order in May of year so that's uh our forecasted schedule all right um as I mentioned on December 22nd 202 three so a month ago approximately the department determined that the wagon trail solar project application was complete an application is complete when the applicant has submitted uh information adequate for the council to make findings or impose conditions on all applicable Council standards and then uh following that completeness determination on January 3rd 20 24 the applicant filed a complete application with the following uh this the completeness determination by the department the department uh provided notice to reviewing agencies and the public of um and let's see this meeting tonight the public information meeting uh is not a comment time frame but uh we hold this meeting voluntarily to uh explain the project in the process now that we've gotten to completeness but I want to just uh reiterate that or or explain that a complete application is not an approval or an approved uh facility it's just that we've deemed that there's enough information for Council to make findings or impose conditions so we're still only at the third step of the process for application requirements and Council standards every project has to meet the same 14 General standards uh the magnitude of what an applicant has to provide to document that they've met the burden of proof for each standard varies based on the type of energy facility and the location of the",

        "text": " so I have a hard time I want to be prepared and I want to engage but I I lack to see why this is a wccc topic can someone help me out with that I I part of it is under the wccc uh land use is also under our umbrella and I think that's why we're looking at this um and you know addition to our transportation this is a land use issue in our area that's how it's been presented to me is that you um the Metro Council will be making an urban growth boundary decision by the end of 2025 2024 excuse me so December of this year um we've come to WCC before to give you periodic updates on the analysis that goes into that decision um and this is the last of those uh update uh informational sessions so that when you you now have access to our Urban growth report which is a full report that brings all of this analysis together and that is a decision-making tool for the Metro Council that's something now that you have access to and I hope that this information will just help you digest that information when you get it and um help you weigh in on this important decision that satisfactory May no but I get it I just think that okay what are you asking us to do here just absorb this is not a regional like you say Regional decision yeah here let me go ahead and let me get into some slides here because I think it'll help me explain so can you go to the next slide which had a a schedule so we're not asking anything of WCC today um I'm here to again give you a periodic update to help lead into this next phase of decision making in which it will be important that um you have the opportunity to weigh in on this Urban growth boundary decision that the Metro Council will make in December of this year so you can see that final decision being on this um in the orange color at the very end of this timeline that's the final decision we are at a at a inflection point right now moving between the navy blue and the orange on this line we're transitioning from the collection of data and information to to inform the decision and the actual policy discussions that happen over the next several months leading into the Metro's final decision the information that feeds into that decision includes City proposals for expansions and there's one city proposal it's from the city of Sherwood um that is discussed and is part of the urban growth report um as is all of this information you see in navy blue uh different kind of forecast and information about what's coming both understanding the demand for land in the future for the next 20 years and the capacity within the growth boundary to absorb that need it's kind of the basis of the analysis that we've been doing and that is published in the urban growth report that report is now available on Metro's website um and does this I can um make sure that you get that uh website link emailed to you after this presentation so we're at a critical time um empact is going to weigh in on um on this by making a recommendation to the Metro Council about a ugb decision that's scheduled right now in September so that is an important place for involvement and participation go to the next slide and I'll give you some specific dates um the ugr was published last week and that kicks off a public comment period which runs until August 22nd that's 45 days um Council had a work session as uh on the day that we kicked off Well published the urban growth report mtac will be talking about it this week and MAAC um we'll be getting an overview of the urban growth report which includes the the information I'm going to dig into today um at their meeting uh later this month um that discussion will continue in August in August the next uh thing you can expect is a recommendation from metra's Chief Operating Officer that the urban growth report does not include an answer about whether the boundary should be expanded or not instead it provides data and information as a tool for decision makers it provides ranges of data ranges of growth and capacity um that allow decision makers to decide within that um available information what the right choice is about expanding the boundary or not so the COO recommendation will include a recommend ation for folks to respond to and that will be the subject of conversation at both mtac and empac um at the end of August going into September and then decision making happens um recommendations coming from empac as I said on September 25th um and Council holding a first public hearing on the the recommendation from Metro coo on 26th so those are opportunities to participate um in this decision and to share information that your thoughts thoughts and ideas about the analysis um I'm here just to feed you a little bit more information about the analysis like we have been in months past um and allow you to an ask some questions of me and my staff um about that information before we head into these upcoming meetings of EK and the Metro Council next slide so that information is specific to employment land um we of course look at housing land and employment land um is part of this decision I'm going to focus on employment land for first so you can understand the results of our analysis and I'm going to start first with capacity so if you could go to the next slide um I've got a series of maps here that begin to give you a sense um of the capacity of commercial industrial and mixed used zoned land inside the urban growth boundary the size of these circles relates to the Acres available and you can see the way many of these cluster particularly in industrial um that blue color um you can see is the industrially zoned land that is vacant in the region so that's absolutely nothing's built on it not even a parking lot if you go to the next slide um you can begin to see maps of this is focused again IND same colors industrial is in blue commercial in red and mixed use in purple um this is infill so an example of infill would be um an area where there is vacant land um near existing development so there there's space on the property for new development um many cases we have um industrial properties that maybe have another lot um that they keep vacant for their for future needs this would count into that and our my third map to show you is um about Redevelopment so next slide so these are areas that we've identified as redevelop Land employment land you see commercial standing out a lot um more in this map commercial is in red mixed juice is purple and again um blue is industrial and you see far more showing up there in the Portland area along the river um with opportunity for redevelopment much less of that um in the outskirts although there's some in Happy Valley area and Oregon City next slide okay so overall we um totaled up the number of Acres so these are Acres um inside the urban growth boundary to understand what capacity we have for future development you can see again the vacant infill Redevelopment those are the three different maps that I just showed you um and the Industrial and Commercial land that's available so we do have um capacity inside the growth boundary for a total 5,950 industrial acres and 481 for commercial next slide so the next part of this we're looking inside the growth boundary this is about our demand so what the requirement of state laws that we look forward 20 years to understand the needs for 20 years in order to accommodate um that growth so let's go to the next slide um it started with a a regional 7 count um Metropolitan service area look at employment uh growth potential for the next 20 years um and we looked at that by sector and then this is kind of a process that we take to figure out what that this starts with number of jobs so we do an estimation of the regional employment forecast by number of jobs and this sort of just takes you through how we move from number of jobs into acres demanded to accommodate those jobs because obviously it depends a lot on the type of job um different jobs op occur in different size buildings that take up different land demand so we need to understand what the growth in different Industries are so we can understand what is likely to happen in the next 20 years in terms of that demand for buildings and what type of buildings so this is that process um your cities and counties use an nearly identical process in developing your um employment opportunities analysis we look at um historic ugb capture rates by sector that's how we move from a sount regional forecast to what we think of that seven count what of it is going to um tend to land inside our Urban growth boundary we base that on historic numbers um and estimate the future based on what it has been historically um and then we go into um we look at hybrid work has become much more of a significant portion of work demand than it has been in the past and so we took that pretty seriously this incorporating um what the in office time for different work sectors and employment sectors was and took that um took that into consideration we assign shares to six different building types so at its most basic imagine an office building and the a land that an office building takes up compared to a warehouse an Amazon warehouse for instance and how many employees are inside an Amazon warehouse and how much time that space that takes up so and it's most basic but we have six different types um that we look at account for different um office vacancies vacancy is a normal um part of doing business it's not un usual to have a small vacancy rate of um uh but uh we tend to have higher vacancy rates right now due to covid and Recovery we are assuming a recovery of those to more stable normal vacancy rates we look like I said at the square foot per employee and the floor area ratios which starts getting into an office building can sometimes have more than one story whereas a as a warehousing for Amazon typically is one story and ultimately that gets us to acres demanded so basically with this slide I just want you to understand that we go from numbers of employees needed by sector to understanding what the Acres demanded by each of those um types of buildings are that's how we get to uh demand for employment so let's see the results let's go to the next slide um our results are going to be in terms of Industrial and Commercial so two categories important to understand um that Medical",

        "text": " focus only on what's happening in the region as far as what ODOT does outside to Lobby the federal delegation about these sorts of things I can't speak to that they do have their own Federal Lobby shop that they work with um and so it's possible that they're going out there asking for a lot of things that we try to provide the United Regional front in this conversation so if we were to bring up Wes I would never want to say anything that's necessarily in opposition to or outside of what ODOT is willing to take on or try Med is willing to take on um but we would be mindful of those Partnerships if we were to bring that forward as an agenda item and want to have in from them and you can just see ODOT turn on their camera so um but so um I don't know Dawn or Stephanie if you want to add anything here I'm questions about what other folks are doing so couldn't have said it better myself Aaron that's great yeah I don't have anything to add but I can definitely take questions back um I don't know anything about our lobbyists and on their agenda for this so damn I I haven't been uh closely tied to the planning process of this but I'm happy to take questions back to our lobby team and Tom markgrath who has been planning this in our on our team hey are there things for Aaron I've I've got one more for Aaron perfect so Tualatin is spearheading uh filing a CFI Grant under the infrastructure dollars and getting it done by the end of the month and we're doing it in coordination with Sherwood and Tigard I believe it's due by May 30th so I would love to follow up with our Representatives also on a DOT and I know they won't look at the applications that quickly but uh just checking on throwing this if we may you know if we check the boxes right that kind of thing because we're looking for 15 million dollars uh what's the project sorry this uh uh CFI the electrification uh Grant that's part of Dot's infrastructure Act yeah there has been some talk at the with um Prima and Metro as they're trying to put together who we're seeing at the federal level about seeing if there's any opportunity to meet with folks who are looking at the electrification portion of all of the new funding opportunities so thank you for that reminder so I'll put that um in the hopper with their consideration again it's a matter of who's available to meet when applications are pending so um but that's really helpful so here's how I'm going to summarize what I've heard is that there are a number of projects that are being looked at that have you know throughout the county and they have a lot of multimodal considerations but also just making sure that people can be safe as they move through our transportation system regardless of what type of user they are and we can use some of those talking points and themes as we put together kind of well we're going to discuss this with our federal delegation and what the opportunities are at the federal level to support us and then ask them for what we're not seeing um so I I will work all of these pieces into the conversation about how we need the federal government to step up because there's the um making sure that the um the standards by which were reviewed do not overwhelm our ability to make progress in those goals um also just the diminishing return on every dollar that we have created locally creates us um is we're seeing increasing gaps between how we can close that that funding to finalize these projects that have been well planned and well thought out um and then talk some some specifics around each individual project and then using a list of you that are attending I will be making assignments to folks about how to talk about the things that you all have brought forward and make sure that that reach even if you're not on the trip that you are represented by the Washington County group that's that petted out there um we tend not to get a ton of face time for those Thursday meetings because we've already met with them on Tuesday but we want to have these talking points ready and prepared to go um and everybody have an opportunity especially you know with representative Salinas being relatively new to this um any guidance we can provide her federal office on how to help us pull down more resources into her District the better off we are so um if any more projects come forward and then I'll look again at the list of pending things that we're also aware of and try and plug those into some overall talking points but I think it's you know the system has to work for all users that the standards by which for judge have to make sense for making progress and that um we need to be able to close funding gaps that are unexpected based on the cost of everything going up over the last few years and everyone looking at Revenue shortfalls because of how Oregon decided to tax everyone but I'll leave that separate snide comment to myself and not put it into talking points um with that um as we get more of the itinerary thrilled down I will share it out with those of you that I know are attending the trip um and if you have staff that are also joining you and I don't have that name it'd be really helpful um I know that folks sent tomarcraft their emails and cell phone numbers if you could also share those with me in case I don't have them it's really helpful for me so that way if someone is lost somewhere in Washington DC they can get a hold of me and I can find them if I'm like we're missing a mayor and we're about to go in through security and this gets complicated um so especially for that Thursday trip and then the final piece would be for asking folks if they're interested in joining a Washington County the geography dinner on Wednesday night just so I have a head count of who would want to attend that um I may may maybe won't um invite our representative from the jpact group that also sit on Metro to join us but we might not they might they might not be special enough to join us um for that dinner um but uh if you guys have questions the the itinerary is you know still floating out there if you have questions about anything that will go that's happening about security about anything that's happening in DC please feel free to reach out to me and to Stephen because we will also both be there um joining you on this trip we will be sitting quietly in the background um but I've done one of these trips so I have tons of experience um attending so but I'm happy to answer um and work with you to make sure you feel like you get the most out of this trip on behalf of your local governments because that's why we go so commissioner and could you say when we should expect the the layout of the scheduled agenda I am not 100 certain when that full agenda is going to come out I am only really in charge of the Thursday portion the ref is um TriMet and Metro are getting everything else nailed down and so much of that is about when the federal agencies get back to us about who is available and where we can go so um I don't remember when my next check-in with those folks is um but as quickly as possible as soon as I have the information we'll get it out to you I can say that Tuesday evening will be well after that Alaska flight land because it's purple we'll all just do the meeting on the last flight um but we'll as soon as I know I will let folk know and I will probably create a living document that everyone can um push forward related to or so you can see it and then keep it updated as I can it's my first time attending uh this type of jpac related trip so um I'm wondering in terms of like the layout TriMet is John do you know if you're so there will be a TriMet agenda and then Washington County agenda it sounds like what you're saying Aaron that you're developing the Washington County agenda and scheduling those meeting with our delegations and then TriMet is doing China and Metro work together climate and Metro work together to establish the jpact agenda which is Tuesday and Wednesday um and then on Thursday when we're doing those Washington County specific meetings that's the agenda that I'm working to develop John did I cover that and what's happening on Monday Monday we're flying out there I thought there was something happening just that evening there is a reception for folks to coordinate and get together that evening after everyone lands the assumption is that we'll all fly out on Monday during the day I believe yeah and that's all right based on what I know Aaron um try minutes working with Metro to get the overall agenda finalized and I think you're right what we're waiting on is hearing back from the agencies on who can actually meet with us um that's what we're waiting on before the final comes out and more will come forward I think at jpac about this as they go through developing those final documents thank you both and our questions for Aaron thanks Aaron we'll be in touch thank you all right that brings us to item C the jpac agenda I'll turn the floor over to Mayor you're muted Steve all right thank you you know I'll just point out chair Beaver Nick that you're probably the only person that cared that I was muted everybody else was hoping I would stay muted but thank you so um on our budget or I'm sorry on our agenda um you know we will be looking at um the unified work planning work program and uh then we will be also spending time looking at the carbon Reduction Program uh and approving that and then also high capacity Transit strategy which you know will be uh kind of basically what Ali already presented today that will be presented at jpact also and I will bring forward some of the some of the issues that you shared today I will bring those forward Heidi just trust me I always bring forward Hall Boulevard you know just like when um mayor Knapp was with Wilsonville we automatically brought up you know the Boon you know the Boone Bridge so anyway we got that covered so those are those are the big things and then um you know the project list input or the regional transportation plan um so that is pretty much it uh for our TPAC reps is there anything you want to bring up or highlight from your May 5th meeting if they're promoted or not or raise your hands if you wanna discuss something which is always important I",

Josh Eggleston to Branch officer Julie Wernicke Transportation Planning dimensional project excuse me thank you have to swallow that by the sandwich right um so just I'm just going to do a really brief update I've got some uh photographs to pass around real quick for everybody peek through those our pre-bond purchase fire engine was delivered to Eugene last Thursday that's the first picture in the packet and we expect it to be in Salem here by the end of April and begin training our cruise hope to happen search by first of June so it came from Wisconsin driven out to Eugene and all of them will follow that at the ladder truck that was a pre-bond purchase uh is scheduled to uh have its final completion and Factory inspection in May will be delivered in June and outfit training and service by August this year for the bond uh apparatus we've basically purchased all the acronyms which are reported last meeting and we are expecting the arc truck aircraft firefighting rescue truck um to be delivered by next May 24th um we do have an existing RF truck that will function uh in that purpose uh when the planes begin Landing here so we're prepared to that two ladder trucks will be arriving uh the next two letter Parks will be Reviving in August of 2024. 16 fire engine will be arriving in September October November of 2024. heavy rescue in August of 25 the area you have vehicle in September of 0.5 it's two Wildland fire engines will be a fall 24 and two ambulances some are 24 and those are dependent on the chassis delivery uh whenever you order commercial chassis sometimes they're behind and six o'clock you know we have identified seven properties uh for each new station location we are going through the vetting process of really digging into their viable properties so at some point probably this fall we'll be bringing back uh some recommendations to this group or which properties we would bring forward to purchase your uh station instructions for both station 12 and you said seven properties of total or seven properties that would potentially uh you know in other things like Wetland issues and there's all kinds of you know who owns it so we're just kind of delving down into that stuff we've got I would say we've got two or three properties for each location that is that are ideal so we're not constrained by having to the last couple of pictures in that group are uh just wanted to point out that we are switching to Electric Johnson Supply tools so right now we have gasoline now ordered uh four cycle engines that have a pretty sweet carbon footprint they run on hydraulic fluid um we did some extensive testing earlier this year in preparation for the bond to pass and it did so that's great uh on some Electric Tools they are absolutely fantastic they're quicker they're cleaner cut an entire car apart with one battery um and the new cars have that boron steel in them and lots of more more steel and safety managers a difficult cut so these tools are we have pilantro now it's hydraulic power so this is the next version of so those will be all electric and then our fans that we have on our water trucks and our heavy are also gasoline powered and we are switching to electric powered fans they run 45 minutes on a battery and then you just plug them into an electric source so so they're very portable so you can take and get initial ventilation in your fire buildings very quickly and they're made in Albany so it's a local purchase and the dealer that we bought the Camacho tools from is well those can be used underwater um so they're very you know in extreme circumstances we have to cut into a car or whatever it's under water they'll work so they're pretty high-tech uh technology they've come a long way so I just want to highlight that that we are looking at ways to reduce our carbon footprint it's a small reduction I realized because we're we don't run these motors every day but it is a production and it is important to the electrification of where we can take advantage of that um the last thing I wanted to say was we did a little more research on Portland's electric fire truck it's being provided by peers who was our apparatus manufacturer Portland doesn't actually own that truck so I didn't buy it um they're doing some kind of a trial period with Pierce Pierce still owns the truck so I've asked my folks to have a conversation with our sales people about is there an opportunity for us sometime in the future to have a trial truck there's infrastructure that has to go in place to do that but I still don't think they're ready for prime time but it would be next to figure out what are the what are the in a real life experiment so that's my report what is the um what's the uh plan for deploying the new equipment in various stations around the city is it based on you know how many ancient hours are on a particular truck or is it based on usage particular stations yeah so the brand new truck we're getting one injured in one ladder those will be put into the fleet uh and we will take the truck with the most mileage out and put it in reserve status we try to balance the islands across the entire place so for example station three is our busiest station and uh they've got a Placer on the truck that says engine three well we can slide that placard out put another truck in there and slide back in so we try to balance the mileage across the entire engine Fleet as they come in we'll we'll do that uh we'll explicit game trucks at once it takes us a little while we have eight trucks you know in service insert a jigsaw around jigsaw around but it's the entire fleet So eventually they'll all be new trucks in fact the truck that we're getting this spring is so similar to the trucks we're ordering once we train on that trucks thank you thanks you picked that one because one was so just quickly the progressive try to get ourselves but start that construction as small as we talked about last meeting doing construction in parts during the summer time on April 25th for those things so Alan the number one question I got after yesterday's speech was regarding with Bill press and my use of the term cycle track and I knew that that was going to be people were going to be like what are you talking about races what could you talk to us a little bit about what that means how I got into the project and you that we shared I guess by email what we're talking about there is a separated bike facility so it's out of the street separated traffic by the curb on both sides of the street on both oh I I just spoke yesterday I thought it was two ways a single two-way it is two-way but it's in both directions yeah I accidentally spoiled spoiled here announcement speeches but anyway that's that's where the facility is and it was a bit of a trip to Incorporated in this project because the industrial safety is a consideration right away that's why I try to make the facility as compact as but luckily relative to General travel planes so there's no bike Lanes on the pavement they're all these disciples good thing about a cycle track is uh those tracks will dive down to the and prose against so they'll cross the multiplication does come down to the street level where we're crossing intersection I can show you what that looks like that'd be great by taking the five foot Five Points we're able to build it within the same level right so myself excellent yeah Mickey has a question I do have a question I was wondering I mean I think this is absolutely fantastic but I'm wondering how um under our current design standards how we can incorporate something like with something yeah this was actually it's another Street section okay so it's the typical Street section or something we're going to the on projects last year all at the same time save America so so even though we haven't that's Transportation this is a master plan yeah we can go ahead and start putting things like this in projects that's what we approached this one I when we uh we've got something in the in the future and developer okay so that's the distinctions that this is our projects that's helpful okay yeah it's wondering what the difference was okay I mean they can't put those over to three sections as well sometimes just to follow up on that I mean it surprised me that there was a cycle track because speaking out on the tsp well here's what a collector's read looks like and it is like so I was really pleased to see that excellent yeah okay so I know that 12th Street retailing is included in the bond later will the buy things that are on 12 13 which are kind of that couplet going through there well they connect it all with the bike Lanes here on in theory they should right fantastic so I would love to when we go to review those payments on 12th I don't think 13th is in there but 12 is for sure but I'd love to see if we can make those as protective as we can so that you know then you're going to have this whole corridor from the 12th Street Promenade and Union Street Bike way if you can connect it all the way out there being protected in that way I can be really fabulous and I don't know what that looks like I know 12th Street is rather wide and we have parking on both sides and a bike lane already there so I'm trying to see if we can do you know work the magic like you guys did with this project on looking at the space we have and trying to figure out how can we make it work so that we do have as protected as we can I'm looking forward right now that connection is directly on the 13th it should go around that corner um yeah yeah last week and we're actually working with that process now that's on the agenda to the chair dance now if you're successful with that there were a lot of times one thing about McDonald's so I wanted to say one more thing and it is not about bike Lanes it's actually about Manimal covers the sunken ones all over town that you feel like not at all I wanted to just give",

        "text": "and we'll get started around 1002 so if you have a couple minutes go grab some water get back and we'll get started then thanks thanks to those who've joined in the last few minutes we'll get started in about a minute thanks all right it's 1002 by my watch and so i will go ahead and get us started um so thank you so much for joining us today uh this is an initial conversation with interested members of the public about two heat pump programs that the oregon department of energy will be standing up hopefully in the new year um i wanted to just quickly get started by um asking folks to go ahead and introduce themselves in the chat as we get started just say your name and then any particular interest you have if you work for an organization or you own rental properties or anything that you would like to share about us so we kind of know who's in the audience today and can make sure we're ready for questions and hit some points that we think will be relevant based on on who's in the audience today so just to get started the oregon department of energy we are an agency that exists to help oregonians make informed decisions and also to maintain a resilient and affordable energy system so heat pumps definitely fit into that mission as you know they provide a more efficient heating and cooling than other options on the market we also just want to flag that this fits into what we do as an agency by being one of our new energy programs actually two of our new energy programs and while i've got this slide up i'll just go ahead and introduce myself and then i'll ask other oregon department of energy folks that are on the line whose images you can see on the screen to say hello today so my name is christy split i'm the government relations coordinator for the department i'll also be sort of your host today as we go through the uh the the program uh or the programs i suppose and i'll hand it off to james hi james kogel uh i'm a policy analyst uh department of energy and also will be the administrative rules coordinator for the two programs good morning everyone i'm stephanie cruz i'm a facilities engineer for our energy efficiency and conservation section and i've been um following and supporting the program from legislative concept and we'll be sticking with it for the duration i'm doug bear analyst in the wildfire recovery program which currently issues incentives for heat pump installations great and patricia um i'm patricia phillips i'm here to help with uh just uh trying to get the meeting going and to take some notes so let me know in the chat if you're having any issues thank you thanks patricia so really quickly an overview of how webex works if it's not familiar to you is we are big fans of using the chat that's why we had you try it to introduce yourself so you know where it is had a chance to find it hopefully for those who couldn't find it the screen in front of you looks my screen is black when i look at it but i hear other people's is white and it's inexplicable to me but you may have a black screen you may have a white screen but you can see who the panelists are and then you can also see um into the chat and that's a good place for you to go ahead and ask any questions along the you can also raise your hand and you can raise your hand a couple of different ways but the one that you can see easily on the bottom here is if you click under reactions ray's hand is the top one we kind of make fun of the icon it doesn't really look like a hand raised it looks like a fist raised so that that's the one to look for so if you would like to raise your fist at any point we will go ahead and call on you um at the when the next right opportunity strikes for an interruption and we'll have plenty of chance for questions as we go through so i'll move this along um yeah one thing to note i don't i haven't we do have a couple of folks on the phone so just for folks on the phone um before i move on um you can um star three to raise your hand so it's star three and then star sticks to unmute so um if you're on the phone and want to engage in the conversation uh that is the way to do that and i'll try to remind us of that throughout the so um what i'm going to do is go over sort of senate bill 1536 a little generally and then i'm going to move us into the two programs one at a time that we're asking folks for input on as we approach rule making for these two new programs and along the way i will break for questions so we can do like hand raising and questions at that point or again i'll keep my eye on the chat and so after i talk about each program i'll go ahead and see if there's any questions in the chat so it's kind of the approach and the plan here so no need to hold questions till the end just go ahead and either raise your hand or put them in the chat and then whenever i kind of get into the next logical break i'll grab you so um for those of you who don't know the origin story of these two heat pump senate bill 1536 passed the legislature in february of this last year of 2020 so just about six months ago the governor signed the bill and we were able to start getting to work on the programs the bill was a response to last year's heat dome event so for those of you who recall we had extremely hot weather mostly in the valley the willamette valley and down into the down further into the state as well as washington and canada bc were also affected and in oregon we had 100 oregonians die most of them were in their own homes heat waves are the deadliest natural disaster that can happen and so um the uh a big a really frankly giant coalition of organizations worked together to bring a cooling concept is what um they were referring to it as to the legislative session and so what came out of that bill are several different measures to address heat relief there's for example an an emergency heat deployment program emergency air conditioning deployment program that's the oregon health authority is running there's also a program at the energy trust of oregon where landlords can get um like portable air conditioners to create community cooling spaces and then there's a lot of provisions directing sort of landlords what they can and cannot do when it comes to restricting air conditioning units for example in uh in their properties so a lot of different pieces are in that particular piece of legislation the agency was also directed to do a study in the bill uh regarding cooling needs for affordable housing throughout the state so there's a lot going on in the bill but today we're just going to talk about two things and those are the two things listed right here the community heat pump deployment program and the oregon rental home heat pump program and as we get started in our conversation today i just want to make a note on the inflation reduction act so this bill passed gosh it's maybe even six weeks now i should it used to be just last week or something but time is flying by um so as you know this passed uh not too long ago and the oregon or the u.s department of energy is currently hard at work on implementing a bunch of programs from the inflation investments and jobs act and so we're still waiting for details on that bill that passed last november and so we do not expect to get details on the aspects of the inflation reduction act for quite a while now for those who've been paying attention they'll know that there are some heat provisions to the inflation reduction those provisions have very little detail in the legislation themselves and we have no idea when we'll get the funding in order for us to have programs that reflect that new funding we're not sure yet for example if these two programs we're working on could just take the money and do more work for more folks throughout the state for longer or if it'll require us to set up new programs with new rules so in the meantime what we decided to do as an agency was what i call setting up our programs in a vacuum so we know that the ira is out there and will have some heat pump provisions but we want to make sure that we have a package for oregonians to get heat pumps starting early next year so that's our goal and when we find out more about the inflation reduction act we'll come back and we'll get our programs dialed in so that they can reflect that new stream of revenue i do want to flag with the inflation reduction act there are income restrictions so for example you'll hear kind of a big number of the highest possible incentive for heat pumps but that is for folks that are low income and then the program it looks like might cap out at 150 percent of area median income being the the highest income level we think in reading the statute so we'll wait for details but i just wanted to flag that um off the bat to the folks that are on the line so does anybody have any questions about what's in senate bill 1536 or i guess about our approach on the ira knowing i don't know many details and then we'll dive into the heat pump programs sandra i'm gonna go ahead and take you off mute all right what's your question yeah we can hear you okay uh i was interested in uh the date of effectiveness uh i know that uh when the bill was passed it said that april 1 was the date of effectiveness so does that mean that any heat pump installations thereafter would at this point we have kind of a two-part answer and then i'll dive into the other two um the other into the programs so um the oregon rental home heat pump program has a provision in it that says that you have to apply before the installation so that program will not be retroactive the community heat pump deployment does not have a restriction on retroactivity however most of the details for that program will be left up to regional administrators so i'll get to that in a second and so at this point we were interested in hearing from folks if they want us to have something in the rules one way or another but um but at this point i think it's something that would be left up to the discretion of the regional entities uh and",

        "text": " this every day so they need to be part of the mix too and and they are electrical qualifi and they would be a great resource they do have you know tools and they are are considered first respond responder so I would encourage them to be part of the the mix I've watched um anyway I just from experience I would say don't forget to acknowledge that those are resources available okay I just thought of something else too that I wrote in my notes um and that is just out of curiosity if the um County Emergency manager has been brought into the loop on this this kind of stuff if they are even on other projects in Oregon but um I think that's a good resource to um have part of the discussion is the emergency manager for the county both counties you council members um chair how if I may I just wanted to add and to point out as um we continue forward with this project but um so there is an existing condition that Council previously imposed in the original site certificate it's called gen pso3 it was before the Wildfire standard came into play but it I'll just read it it's prior to construction and operation certificate holder must provide training on fire prevention and response that includes instruction on facility fire hazards they shall notify the department and First Response agencies um at least 30 days prior to the training and provide them an opportunity to participate etc etc and just know that that's kind of a typical condition we previously where we were imposing under Public Services now the challenge is having 10 different conditions that all kind of do similar things and then making sure that they come together in a way that isn't um overly crazy but I think the Wildfire mitigation plan does incorporate this Emergency Management plan which is where these training requirements come in so maybe it's something we can think about again is like how are all these conditions and plans talking to each other to make sure that it's super clear um and that a first an emergency response person if we were to coordinate with them isn't tasked with reviewing 10 different PL and attending 10 different trainings if that were the worst case thank you so in response to that Sarah um again I think that reiter Ates the fact that it's important for us to include it in the Wildfire mitigation plan since it's even though it's spoken about in another plan having it in this is necessary um thank you council members thank you council member IMs I uh do want to say that we um yeah we do agree and our preliminary recommendation was that um and is that there should be coordination with the local fire service providers and the opportunity to provide comment on the adequacy of the plan um and uh comment on their ability to respond um because in the record that that hasn't happened with all the rural fire protection districts or most of them um at this point um we did want the council's input on when in how um that should occur I mean that's something that we can decide but uh there are kind of the options of putting the burden on the certificate holder to go out and do that and provide us evidence that they did um or there's the other model of the certificate holder giving us their best guess and then we circulated and and I think in an Ideal World both that happens where we they do the work and we verify that that it's done and everybody's concerns have been addressed but we did just want to see if the council had any opinion or preference on on how that coordination occurs um and we would recommend that it occurs prior to construction but that that's also part of yeah your process councelor Byer I think um preconstruction is probably the burden on the applicant and then staff from Odo can be involved as as you feel necessary um but you have enough on your plates already um so I would I would require sign off from the local emergency management or some sort of letter from um the Fire Protection District saying yes we've been involved this is good or we would like to see this I think in the when I worked in Crook County the Emergency Management fire person said can't do it until we have the final engineering design because things can change so much that with solar wind may be different but you know let let the applicant and the emergency responders work up at timing preconstruction and possibly a check in before operation starts because it's a different world then there are different things that could happen so maybe kind of a two-time checkin but asking the applicant to take that on with some sort of verification to staff that was just off the top of my head but thank you this is Kenton I concur with what councelor Byer just said in my yeah it it's good chair how councelor R yes I agree with uh councel buyer's um recommendation and I think having um even just a form of letter like you recommended you know something to the council stating that the fire districts and other emergency um managers and Public Utilities have all been contacted and that they are good with the plan yeah thank you council members that's great we really appreciate the direction um I think we kind of one more topic area and I'll call on Nancy as I see her walk away from the ability to do this um yeah so this was just a map of the affected uh rural Fire Protection District I I did want to point out that uh we we have only received comments from I own Ro fire production District so far so we will be looking to coordinate with these other entities um as well as with um other the utilities and emergency response coordinator in the um uh so next slide please um okay so the last uh topic uh I wanted to go over the standard I want to go to was the cumulative effect standard for wind energy facilities I thought it would be helpful just to review the text of the rule um before we get into it there's kind of two issues um associated with this but the primary one was about uh well I think the council received a lot of General comments on the record that um they commenters believe that cumulative impact should be uh viewed more generally should apply to more than just wind energy facilities and um should include a wider scope of impacts I think our recommendation is that that's really outside of the scope of this current proceeding but um we did just want to raise it to your attention again as you think about your rle making priorities or more I guess rule making functions in the future um so the the other issue were really about visual impacts of the facility um both the visual impacts of this facility but then generally the visual impacts of wind energy development in Moro County um and youtil uh so what and I guess we'll go through this and I can come back to this but what we saw is the standard that addresses cumulative impacts or visual impacts is this standard um and the required finding is that the council find the applicant can design construct and construct the facility to reduce cumulative adverse environmental impacts in the vicinity by practicable measures including but not limited to and I'll skip down to um five designing components of the facility to minimize adverse visual features and six using the minimum lighting necessary for safety and security purposes and using techniques to prevent casting from the site except as otherwise required by FAA Administration um there are conditions uh addressing lighting specifically in the um site certificate that does require I think the use of minimum lighting necessary and and kind of repeats this so uh I won't talk about that much more unless the council has more questions on it um but I kind of did want to go through uh the other comments about visual impacts and and then get your feedback on how you'd like us to proceed um if I can get the next um no well I guess first uh there is also requirement to consider cumulative impacts on Raptors and other sensitive Wildlife species uh we had included a proposed condition in the DPO uh requiring uh certificate holder Rec uh represented setbacks from uh Big Butter Creek in little Butter Creek um the certificate holder requested setbacks from Little Butter Creek the those setbacks be reduced from8 miles to 0.5 miles um since the record indicates that the turbine locations were final um and that the only micro sighting changes can occur are really small and that the certificate holder had relied upon that point Eight Mile setb back to demonstrate compliance with a number of small technical issues we're not recommending the council make the change but um we wanted to give you the chance to weigh in if you thought we okay um so next slide um okay and then so the G and but issue more specifically um and uh this is an area we don't have a ton of local knowledge but um you know people on the record just commented that this is an important Landmark to people in the community it is one of the taller peaks in Morrow County um it is uh within the site and there would be a number of turbines I think there's about 18 turbine locations on the but itself uh with um three or four close to the peak of the but um the the but itself is not identified as a significant or important Scenic resource in the County's comprehensive plan um it's on private land that's not subject to any other special management designation so we don't believe it's a protected resource under the scenic resources standard the protected area standard or the recreation standard um so some commenters recommended that the certificate holder be required to address the adverse visual impacts of the facility from the turbines and the lighting under the cumo of effect standard which we just reviewed um and if I could get the next um we will say we we don't have a recommendation on how that should be done we don't think there were practical measures raised in the comments that can be easily implemented without um adversely affecting the operations of the facility so but I we did want to scope out the issue more for you and and see if you had additional ideas wanted us to go further um this slide shows the current state of energy development in the vicinity um you can see that this uh facility is proposed to be cited uh obviously adjacent to the other Wheat Ridge facilities towards the the left in the yellow um you can see the striped uh components of the proposed Sunstone solar project and the proposed Wagon Trail solar project um also close to the bombing range um there's an existing or multiple existing local jurisdictional wind farms to the north of the project and then the proposed no one Hills uh facility would be going into the East um if I can get the",

counties that you'll see here uh lake is mostly non-irable Wasco um it's mostly arable Moro has been mostly arable in high value um so you can kind of get a sense of how that uh Farmland classification impact plays out across the state all right next slide so I've been talking for a while looking forward to the future um dlcd will continue to track the potential impact of solar approvals across farmland um I want to give a bit of a shout out to the Department of energy staff who are extremely helpful um and uh thank you guys for your assistance in compiling data needed to create this section of the report we're looking forward to continuing to collaborate with staff at the department of energy and Department of Agriculture on these conversations regarding the sighting of solar on Farmland going forward into the future so I'm happy to answer any questions the council might have if we have time Todd or I'm also happy to come back and um provide additional information on this topic that I like talking about well thank you very much I'm sorry go ahead Todd I was just going to say I mean um I think we have plenty of time um so if council members have questions um this is a great opportunity this is a great presentation thank you very much Hillary is exactly what I was hoping for and and you know if any of your council members have questions I think we certainly have enough time chair Grail yes this is Kent and Todd I want to thank you um for uh requesting um Ms foot to come over from dlcd and do this presentation I had a career in this for like 38 years uh in County planning and this is one of the best presentations I've heard on um well the conversion of AG land um and anyway very very well done Ms foot I do have a question we've been seeing application applicants come in that uh we're trying to raise the bar on making sure that they provide us with all the information we need in order to justify these exceptions and I think we're doing pretty good at that one of the questions that I have is I've heard of the term and I'm sure you have two agrovoltaics and that's where a solar facility can be put in but yet underneath it there could still be some agricultural use of the land do you have any comments on that yeah so it's something that's kind of frequently in conversations so as part of our 2011 rule making we did have Provisions it might have been the 2017 world making I don't want to miss it there but there are Provisions in our rules that would allow a developer to expand their project footprint if they had approved agriculture plan with the no developers took advantage of that opportunity to submit an agrival take in exchange for sort of uh expanded so that provision in our rules has since sunseted and there hasn't been a ton of conversation about that so it did seem like that incentive uh wasn't necessarily working interesting uh thank you good question oh sorry go ahead Ken I was just saying a good presentation Mr vote well thank you very much Vice chair how um I appreciate it it says hey I'm buyer um echoing Kent's thank you to Liz foot for the presentation very helpful um a couple of things that are interesting to note we aren't seeing solar development at any scale in the Willamette Valley which again suggests that the Farmland protection programs of the LCD are working well but just a reminder kind of to us that we the department of energy has different policy goals perhaps than dlcd even though we work for the same state government and our standards um in applying our citing criteria are different than what the counties do I think it's interesting that we're still seeing most of the solar on non-arable lands and that's encouraging we don't have that particular or test in the f-sec decision process but certainly we've weighed those issues as we considered some of these bigger projects and we'll always I think have different standards than perhaps the LCD and County governments have but it's interesting to see how those play out on the landscape and this is a really good summary so thank you if I might jump in just in response um councilmember buyer so I didn't have time to make an update on my secretary report because I just sort of concluded the evaluation yesterday but we did receive earlier this month uh notice of intent for a 199 megawatt solar facility in Lynn County so just south of Brownsville it would be about two and a half square miles right next to I-5 um and so we are going to get the notice out on that notice of intent very soon so obviously that's going to be high value Farm ground it's in the Willamette Valley so this is the first that we're seeing of that scale and I'll have a bigger update on that at the June 23rd thank you thank you that's that's really informative and interesting that we're starting to see those kind of proposals and that will really um test the Council on our decision making so thank you other questions comments well I want to say um uh chair Grill yes council member Condon is Raising her hand she'd like to ask something thank you for the help Vice chair house go ahead councilmember um thank you chair girl thanks Vice chair how for recognizing me um thank you so much for the presentation I am not a planner I have no planning background and found it very very informative as a foundation so so thank you for that a question um and related to an earlier topic we discussed with respect to um House Bill 3179 and I'm just curious how that Bill how you consider that bill knowing knowing this information and being in it daily um that's an interesting question council member Condon um so it's a it's a little bit and you know we're sort of waiting to for things to settle out and uh finalize and of course um you know we will work with um the framework that the legislature provides for us going forward and I think the important thing here is that we keep having these conversations among our agency staff that are working on these issues and uh collaborating to to make sure that these programs are sort of carried out in an intent with the law and with policies that have been thank you for that I'll just take that and I'll wait and see I'll see what um and if I have a follow-up on a different if I may if no one else and it's related to Drought we've heard by some of the applicants uh water as an issue and I'm wondering how that plays in in a long-term view for for the work you do um so I think this is a very interesting talk topic council member content so thank you for bringing it up um so water you know impacts the program in a number of different ways and I think it'll be really interesting to see what the integrated Water Resource strategy that's currently being developed for 2023 by owrd um might include relative to land use this time around as far as energy facilities uh goes um water is implicated and how you define high value Farmland under 195 300 right and you know actually under the original definition it impacts the land use capability classification of uh land that we're talking about so it can influence whether it's high value or um Etc as far as how it impacts the program otherwise um it's come up in conversations with counties around how sufficiency of water should be evaluated when you're looking at a farm impacts test you know is this use going to be taking water away from allocations for irrigation or otherwise but there are no good answers um to those questions right now so it's something that we are uh engaging in conversations on again through the integrated Water Resource strategy process that owid is managing right now um I think we're having that conversation about how there could be more coordination between the land use planning program and um and the Water Resource Department's uh program as well thank you for that as well um and if I may I have just one more um and it's related to Urban or suburban's uh sprawl onto um Agricultural and Forest Land versus um an energy facility that may have a shorter lifespan than than construction buildings and you know harder Builds on the landscape and I'm wondering how that fits in to how um uh the department looks at or the commission looks at um solar versus uh development of uh industrial for industrial use um other industrial use or housing mm-hmm yeah so there's a lot of uh so thank you council member Condon so there's a lot of conversation that's happening right now um about Urban growth boundary expansion about housing um you know and when agricultural lands are officially urbanized that's happening through a zone change um or through an urban growth boundary expansion and when lands are added to a um they are no longer set aside for Rural resource uses they are now intended to be urbanized going forward into the future and when uh the Zone the property is removed from Farm zoning or Forest zoning there's an exception process that goes along with it where you know there needs to be some demonstration that there are reasons usually now this day and age um there are other Pathways for an exception but typically you're going to find more reasons exceptions um that that property shouldn't be protected under the program that there's something unique about that property or development that's really needed um to precipitate that removal from production so it's a very different process than what we're talking about with solar or maybe you know some other uses that Merit an exception where a certain level of Solar Development is permissible even while that property is still maintained under you know protective exclusive Farm use zoning um ostensibly because a county is found that it's not going to impact you know agricultural operations in the surrounding area the cost of agricultural operations in the surrounding area likewise any other type of Industrial Development that might be permitted say as commercial activity in conjunction with Farm use that's allowed um under the program you'll find also solar projects and other types of resources that require taking an exception to Statewide planning both free just like you would if you were changing the zoning um and so again it requires that there's something unique about that property or about the circumstances or about the proposal that merits waving you know the standards that implements those principles and policies of the Agricultural lands Protection Program I don't know if that answered your question",

        "text": " easy this just states requires no new electric transmission lines or gas or petroleum product pipelines that would require a site certificate and then we talk about what is fsec so the the plan electrical load is 40 megawatts a day and um that would be served by a proposed on-site substation and an additional 1100 foot service line that would not constitute an energy facility by the council's definition similarly for their natural gas supply we cite the council's definition here and then we note that their boilers heaters and other process equipment would operate using natural gas and that would be delivered by a new 8-inch natural gas interconnecting pipeline and it would be approximately 3 800 feet long would tie into that main northwest natural gas pipeline that we showed on the map previously so in in this case it also would not be an fsec jurisdictional pipeline so the fourth criteria d produces synthetic fuel at least 90 percent of which is used in industrial refueling facility located within one mile of the facility or is transported from the facility by rail or barge so next has represented that over 95 percent of the finished products would be transported via ship or barge at the existing port westward dock they'd use about five ships a month or 60 ships a year they have a third party logistics provider provider that they've noted has priority doc access under a long-term lease agreement and they did provide those documents to us with part of their response to our request for additional information last year they've said that a small portion of the fuel less than five percent may be transported by a rail or truck for local but again with what they have stated in their application they would meet this so here's the last one councilmember jenkins had talked earlier about natural gas being used for conversion energy so the last criterion states they must emit less than 118 pounds of carbon dioxide per million btus from fossil fuel used for conversion energy so they report in their a value of 115.9 pounds co2 per million btus and they had a calculation that they provided as part of the response if you look into natural gas a little bit and what are the values that other people use so northwest natural does reporting to the oregon department of environmental an annual basis and when you convert those reports to this pound co2 per million bptu unit you find that they've fallen in a range of 117 to 117.2 over the last 10 years very narrow range the uscpa uses a value of 117 and the council also in other parts of the statute uses a value of 117. certainly seems that the statute was was intentionally written to allow natural gas to be used and to exclude other forms of a fuel that would more carbon intensive so we did receive public comments that contend that the facility will exceed 118 pounds of co2 per million btus based on the life cycle emissions associated with the natural gas used and and basically as staff sees that there are two flaws with those arguments the comets focus on methane leaks at various points in the life cycle of natural gas the council standard explicitly refers to carbon dioxide and not methane and so we don't whether we should consider life cycle or not we certainly don't believe we should be considering nothing and then second the council standard focuses on the point of conversion which is consistent with other council standards related to co2 that's the second part so you know staff's conclusion and recommendation is that the facility does meet this criteria wrapping up here our recommendation first of all although it's not required for the exemption we still firmly believe columbia county's requirements that are outlined in their final orders where they issued their still apply and must be met the department does recommend that council find that the proposed renewable fuels production facility as described in the exemption request submitted by next on march 31st 2022 is exempt from jurisdiction so leave it here for your deliberation uh council could choose to approve the proposed order as the final order you could approve the proposed order with modifications or reject the proposed order and issue a final order denying the request for exemption thank you ali council have comments questions in total agreement with the staff's conclusions and recommendation and so therefore i move the council adopt the proposed order as the final order and approve the request by next renewable fuels llc for an exemption from the requirement to obtain a site certificate from fsec as presented by staff thank you we have a motion this is handling all second promotion thank you we have a second to that other questions comments well this is hanley under comments i would say that you know it's our responsibility to read the clear language of the statute um not uh try and add additional interpretations on that so um i think this reflects the clear language of the statute thank you yes cindy um just a question and a comment with respect to councillor jenkins um i would i would agree uh with councillor jenkins comments but the clear language in the statute reads exclusive use and where did exclusive um allow allow let's see allow separate definitions for feedstock and reactant and reactants don't come under that exclusive but feedstocks do and i realize it's under you know the title is but why aren't reactants a feedstock hey uh wally do you have any comments to thank you for the question council member condenses wally adams again for the record um if i may i'll go back to a slide where i highlighted that phrase again when at least when i read this and i'll just say when i read it you don't want to speculate about what the council how the council read it in the past but exclusively uses biomass i don't i don't think you can stop there i think you have to read the whole sentence and so exclusively uses biomass as the source of material for conversion to a liquid fuel and again to me i believe the way that that's written is referring that primary material the vegetable oils the animal fats the biomass material that is being converted and is not intended to talk about the other things that are necessary to achieve that conversion i think it can be read differently i i don't disagree with that um i don't i don't think i mentioned i'll at least mention here that we did consult with doj on this as and i'll just say that consultation staff was comfortable making this recommendation as well you know we have thoroughly reviewed it um can it be read differently yes we just believe this is the more correct thank you thank you for this comments if there are no further questions or comments and i'd ask mr secretary to please call the role hanley is taking care of my tech issues over here thank you okay hanley jenkins cindy condon marcy grill yes ken howe yes jordan truett motion carries madam chair thank you mr secretary wally thank you for that um thorough presentation that's a lot of technical information so i appreciate your interest in getting it communicated to us um that concludes agenda item c we will move forward with the agenda item d which is the public comment period this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment which includes the boardman to hemingway line proposed order i will i don't know who's going to figure out our comment nancy thanks uh if you will go ahead and do your part with because we got this phone hybrid thing going on that's great all right cheer girl it looks like we have uh angela crowley how's her hand up angela i'm going to go ahead and unmute your mic people in the room i don't know if you have um forms that have been filled out nothing yet no hey there this is angela crowley cook i'm the executive director of asea the oregon solar plus storage industries i would turn my camera on but i'm not quite sure how to do that so i'll just keep talking with you through the audio um i wanted to comment today on your next agenda item about protected areas scenic resources and recreational i'm hoping there's time to comment during that agenda item as well after we hear from staff but just in case not i wanted to share with you of cs thoughts before you so osha has participated in several of the work groups giving rise to this request to begin formal rule making and while we appreciate that several parts of the rules need to be updated our strong preference is that the formal rule making be postponed until the review of fsec is completed the odo implementation for the climate governor brown's climate executive order 2004 says that fsx should simplify procedures for review where necessary and to evaluate standards and application requirements to determine if requirements should be adjusted for different types of energy facilities including renewable energy the report goes on to say rule makings are intended to create efficiencies and reduce the time and cost associated with state jurisdictional reviews while having no negative effect on public and so we're concerned that the scope of this proposed rulemaking goes beyond just updating the rules it does not simplify procedures it does however increase costs and time and does not recognize the unique nature of renewables product projects so it's our strong belief that the rulemaking will be better informed when the results of the review of fsf are completed and so we asked that this formal rule making be postponed until that time osseo will continue to participate if the formal rulemaking does move forward we believe the rules can be more streamlined for solar facilities and to bring us back to some context we know we're in a climate crisis and oregon feels the impacts of that crisis acutely with increased wildfires droughts heat waves ocean acidification changing in habitat and all the other impacts we know about decarbonizing oregon's energy system will require a significant build out of renewable energy facilities with models suggesting that the most cost effective time frame is before 2030. the already lengthy timeline for renewable energy facility approval and permitting makes 2030 a possible date but somewhat ambitious given all the uncertainties in the existing process those uncertainties are unfortunately potentially exacerbated with some of the proposed solutions in the draft again we agree we need to keep regulations up to date and rules but we are concerned that the changes inject more uncertainty into the citing process applications rely on evidence-based process creating uncertainty or open-ended requirements through changes places a greater burden on the",

        "text": " had this conversation a little bit during the work session and we were hoping to have a little more ground under our feet upon fully intended in this instance on what that land Supply land Readiness looks like that conversation is still um waiting for a final report out from the site writing or the land supply subcommittee of the task force so that report hasn't been completely finalized yet but kind of looking at what is that large law Aid is a huge part of that but also making sure that we have site Readiness that's available for those smaller and medium-sized vendors within the the latter of semiconductor Advanced manufacturing and support services so it's not just making sure that we have one big large lot and that's going to take care of the question but making sure that we have the resources from the state to make those lands available for quicker development not just for one really large lot but for lots of a variety of sizes from 50 acres to 100 acres to the larger properties that become the center of the land use conversation what still is not clear is whether or not there will be a super citing provision they're really looking to see if they can find Solutions inside the urban growth boundary that would not require that type of super sighting but that question has not been fully answered yet in in finalizing what it's really going to take to have um a favorable application go into the U.S Department of Commerce and in talking with the staff in um representative bonamici's office they're also tracking this very closely this is something that's incredibly important not just to Senators Wyden and Merkley but also to Congressman bonamichi's office is there's a lot of Investments That become available for Oregon if we become a hub and create opportunities for good living wage jobs for um with an opportunity for more folks to get into those median income jobs that are above a living wage and above minimum wage so in finding out from them what the Department of Commerce is really focusing in on for Oregon is the final stage and making sure that we have right sized this initial 30-day package and when we have more details that's when I'll come back to the board and make sure that it's meeting your needs so that we can figure out if our logo is going on the supporting materials or not so at this point in time I'm happy to answer any questions related to those first 30 days the Sip application I believe is due towards the end of February that's why it's being rushed through at the beginning of session which complicates the you know like it's it's never really a time when we see a lot of work in the Ways and Means Committee it's never a time when we see tax credits um really considered but it is of utmost importance to have Oregon show its work that we are willing to work and we are ready for that chips application from the state to be supported so that we can support the businesses to bring down those resources to help us create better communities with better opportunities across the board um with that I'm happy to answer questions and I'm sorry I don't have more on-site readiness it's okay Commissioners are there any questions or comments on the semiconductor conversation slide go ahead commissioner fly thank you chair Harrington um Aaron thank you for that overview I was just reforming you said something about the incentives piece in the first 30 days and I was reflecting back on my notes what I wrote down back when we had that presentation um and one of the incentives that was being recommended was extend Enterprise Zone that's not part of the first 30 days it is I just short-handed that to sip and gain share because that's what we as a county have focused on but yes that would also include um extending the sunset on Enterprise and Rural long-term Enterprise zones which are um how other areas of the state have created more opportunity their shorter property tax exemption areas the county itself has not um to my knowledge opened up an Enterprise Zone um in County unincorporated areas that some of our cities within Washington County have in addition there's a number of other cities and counties that have looked at the rural long-term Enterprise tax abatement program to incentivize their their areas where they provide those Advanced manufacturing other support services that support um this part of the industry but yes it is part of that initial 30-day effort okay yeah thank you for the explanation because in the in the previous presentation the two were recommending subred like extend game share and combining the two so we're our board will see a conversation that's combines to two extending gain share and extending the Enterprise Zone okay yeah my expectation is there will be one or two bills depending upon relating to Clauses and the the laws that LC requires us to follow as far as how many topics you can have in one one bill um game share has a separate uh Sunset it is only tied to the Strategic investment program tax abatement or sip tax abatement Enterprise zones don't come with a gain share type program okay yeah I just was referring thank you that clarifies for me thank you the form will be is controlled by the legislature yeah other comments or questions I don't really have any comments that I didn't make the last time I'm all supportive of uh having us take a look with caveat the state has to be an active partner I mean this is not fair to local government not to be and my other one is this goes back my memory and then sometimes we've dealt with my things I've kind of Forgotten but we looked Once Upon a Time many years ago in Enterprise zones or zones and I thought legislative folks internally I should realize legal folks internally yeah I told us it's not not permissible for a county to have an Enterprise Zone dude just for cities but maybe that's all changed by now so if that's the case they'd have to enable through some legislation as to have an Enterprise to do these things is that is that still would that I thought that's what Aaron was saying maybe I decidedly they have to allow us to do that yes okay counties could not have Enterprise zones okay well that sounds still true all right yeah go ahead unincorporated areas yeah the one question that I don't know the answer to and we'll look up and make sure that I get all this detail right and confer with Tom and his colleagues in the general counsel's office to make sure I don't act as a lawyer in any way shape or form is the the rural Enterprise zones might be slightly different and that might be where Counties have invested um I need to double check that though so please don't take my word on that um and as to your appointments um about being an active partner we are trying to right size uh um investment package that the legislature will bring in the hundreds of millions of dollars um to Bear Insight Readiness so that they are paying oh and and how we run that program I think is the other key piece of are we going to continue to use the regionally significant industrial sites program or make modifications to um so that the state is really putting the money forward because that I think is key to the industry is that they need those upfront infrastructure costs um cared for and one of the key messages that I've taken away from from this board is not just the on-site it is the off-site it's all the things that make the capacity possible including the livable communities around it making sure that it's not just one property that wins it's that our community wins when the state invests just have one follow-up go ahead uh Aaron what you just said remind me of to ask this question and um is I I know you said there's 1900 bills I'm I'm not gonna quiz you but I am wondering if there is if you're hearing any talks around if there is a bill to undo what I don't remember the bill number but in my notes somewhere you should add that support yes um she mentioned the site Readiness this is my question is related to sight Readiness to just be clear and something that you said Aaron that reminded me that's the question uh there was a bill I think um in 2014 40 78 in 2014 that does the rural designation rural Reserve versus Urban Reserve designations is are you hearing um rumbling conversations about to undo that bill did to undo the did it pass in 2014 it um that's the bill that set the urban and rural reserves in Washington County um the litigation of also referred to as the grand bargain um which is uh coming into question right now there are individual bills related I think that are looking at specific areas where that might happen but that's also where the super sighting piece of what might come out of the land um area finding a large lot may look at um areas that have been designated as rural reserves as potential sites for super sighting and that would again he could chunk out of that agreement that was reached in house bill 4078 in so rural reserves are um a constant piece of conversation there are some specific legislative Concepts that I I have not identified quite yet but I am certain are in my um that would look at some of those designations I think that this um the other component to this package that might disrupt that bill is related to the super citing and providing that someone likely the governor with the authority to supersite even if it is um a rural Reserve if that is the only means of finding identifiable industrial lands that can be made development ready thank you in case you didn't hear earlier as part of board communication uh commissioner FYE had the opportunity to meet with Mr Tom Vander zanden and uh hear a little bit of history from his thank you I I was unfortunately in a Committee hearing already at 8 A.M this morning so thank you so um uh I forgot my question already oh yes so on the semiconductor conversation uh you talked about not having seen an updated report yet do you know if there are draft versions circulating um my understanding is that there's a memo and it's probably I will I can share that that the initial take but they had to do more research and they were planning to meet again I believe it's this week and so it should be forthcoming what their final recommendations are but I will I will confer with um active and Lut to make sure that we have all of the information to you and I will provide it with um the Friday memo that um comes out if I can locate it",

Greek okay let's create 2450 North Foothill Road um first of all thank you for being here Odie thank you for being here it's a very informative you know I'm going to start by saying I I don't think there's anybody in this room who doesn't value and appreciate the strong utility infrastructure that we have and I understand the need for redundancy I get that but the point I think I want to make to and to Ode is I guess I don't understand why this is needs to happen you know pbnl already has 230 kilowatt lines that exit Lone Pine substation Head East up the hill and then parallel Foothill Road a good 600 yards up behind residences away from people we talked a lot about um the impact lessening the impact and can you help me understand why there wasn't a proposal to piggyback or parallel those lines and not intrude on our communities our families on impact our property values it seems like that would be a real feasible alternative to doing what you would propose to do to us today well the first thing you have to be clear on is what we have to do is get from loan so you're already limited by your endpoints you have to get from one to the other now you're limited in paths to get between so um our our routes do try to follow lines as much as possible that's why we're going uh and I don't remember the names of the roads to the north but near Kirkland Road where we're going to be double circuiting along next to the 115 so we do try to account for following existing easements to impact people as least as possible it's also why we're following roads to the best that we can because roads are already an impact one of the things that wek requires of us is that if you have a circuit that serves a purpose and you're going to Bill a build a second circuit that seems serves the same purpose you can't have them in close proximity or to each other or on the same structures as each other for a long period of time so it would be no different than if I had two plugs for a lamb and I plugged them both into one socket and they both ran to the same light and then I put them right next to each other on the ground if I run them both over and cut them they're both gone They don't serve the Redundant purpose so they have to be separated in order to serve that redundant purpose can you can you grow that what is separation say that again what is separation what constitutes separation what does that mean how far apart do they have to be in most Administration about really wide open area uh it seems to be readily available for a second set of lines yeah in most cases it's what they they look at the ruling span uh distance and in this case it would be about 600 yards 600 meters even if I paralleled now I'm 600 feet away from an existing line and not bumped up and next to it like I can lines that are not the same circuit I have now increased the impact because now I have property that's stuck between two power lines for 600b or 600 meters I don't know if that made sense but all of that is taken into account in order to try to find a route that again it's going to be the least impactful that we can get in so I understand what you're saying and this goes back to what I tried to say earlier I don't know that I'm going to give you an answer that's going to satisfy you but we do look at all of what you're bringing up to try to find around that would follow I mean existing lines existing roads all the way between two even if we do that we're still going to find people who are impacted and who are going to be angry and say why didn't you put this line around that hill where I wouldn't see it or it's not next to 17 other lines okay okay thank you okay so I I did want to at least try one more time Brian Millard Ryan Millard in the room okay he's not in the room all right so that's it for my comment cards before we turn it over to the webinar and the people on the phone is there anybody else in the room that wants to ask a question or make a there's no one on the phone no one with the hand raised but let's go ahead and read that do you want to read it okay so for people who are on the webinar and the bottom of the main window is a set of icons click on the tab that says participants and then click on the handout icon on the bottom right of the participant and that will raise your hand and then Nancy can see you on the computer and she will call on you and then if you want to lower your hand you click it again to lower your hand so for people on the webinar if you're interested in asking a question and making a comment um please follow those instructions to raise your hand we're going to give you a minute just to see and then for people who are on the phone if you press star three on your phone it will also Ping On Nancy's computer and she'll see you I actually have an buyer and has a question okay and buyer is on the webinar so yeah we can hear you okay this is Ann Byer I am a fairly new member of the energy facility signing Council I wanted to take time to thank the department of energy staff for their presentation as well as Pacific core and thanks to all the people who are sitting in on this presentation I just want to encourage you to stick with the process I I understand that it's long but there are many opportunities for public comment and I know that I and the other council members really take your concerns and your comments into consideration I think a really good example of that is on the new Wildfire standard where the council did just adopt a new standard to address concerns that we had heard about from the public so thank you all for your participation stick with this because you have valid points that you're raising thank you Nancy you can you can re-mute me thank you Anne thank you council member buyer is there anybody else Nancy that has their hand up no I do not have any others do we have any Star threes on the no ma'am okay that's fine what you had said regarding studies show the properties are not really affected so many feet out or are you willing to put that in writing I'm not sure what are you talking about EMF or monetary yeah yeah it's the EMF that that's that is scientific data I mean they have you can measure it you can measure the field so then why do property values fund it interception yeah perception well yeah perception but if you could where can we give them information I mean by Realtors and stuff if we want to give them information if you're going to sell a piece of property they ought to be at um work knowledgeable have some something that can show a perspective buyer so the only real the only study that I have ever personally read which was done by the real estate community it indicated there was no cost impact on houses because of the existing utilities I will have to go try and find it again it's been a very long time but what what it did conclude is that what you might find is that a home near a line might take longer to sell than a home not near a line or a home near a substation might take longer to sell than a home not near a substation time can be valued as money but as far as what this particular real estate study indicated is if a home is worth a hundred thousand dollars here it's worth a hundred thousand dollars there it just might take longer to get it that's the only one I've ever personally read and it's been it's been a while since I've read it I'll have to go back go back search but if you put a comment in or leave your name I will try to find it for you I spoke to an Maia appraiser and he said the opposite of what he just said which is what I said earlier though too you get on the internet you're going to find Six studies that say it's this six that say it's the other well I didn't go in there I spoke to a Mai real term but the opposite ways again though it's you're going to find opinions that vary across the world We Believe some of these questions are just they're I can't give you an answer that is going to satisfy you I'm telling you what I believe I'm telling you what the company believes uh who you want to accept as what the real impact is going to be that's going to be up to you I would fact if if we come to you for an easement I would be unafraid to factor that in to a request for compensation the goal the goal through that compensation is also and again I say it this way intentionally at the end you will feel less angry at us if we compensate you appropriately but if I put a line near your property I've never had anyone say thank you all right um any other okay I see one more um you mentioned that there's a small section of residence on hillbrow that already have transmission lines then stacked on top for single pole those go away at all if not the transmission lines but the high power lines go away Bill Gates drought yeah no no this doesn't replace alignment this is needed in addition so if there if there's a section of transmission line that is like the one that goes near Kirkland Road near the north we would double circuit it you would see a single set of poles with two sets of three wires or six wires",

        "text": " renewable hydrogen for export and so and renewable hydrogen are are markets that are growing globally and so there's certainly that possibility of you know if there were excess uh renewable hydrogen produced in the northwest that this could be a very valuable commodity uh to ship over to asia we don't really touch too much on that in the in the study um but to some degree great and then a question from jason you gas plants are not allowed in oregon um it's referring to a recent bill passed hp 2021 hydrogen plants are allowed so is blending allowed for new plants and jessica was asking for confirmation on whether blending with conventional fuels was the question we didn't hear it yeah i'm gonna assume that there that jason's asking about blending with natural gas and you know that that's a great question um that is you know one of the challenges of uh incorporating renewable hydrogen is going to be you know figuring out the answers to some of these questions eligibility and citing um janine offered that she heard that there's some investigation into using hydrogen at the coma washington's port and then sashweth asked if there's a specific reason why short duration storage was included since lithium-ion batteries are more suitable to that currently based on efficiency and hydrogen will find its most effective use in seasonal storage as per your research that is a great point and as mentioned that's really where um those uh lion batteries shine um here i was discussing um you know i use the the nomenclature of short duration energy storage where really i should i should say for um you know potential grid balancing services batteries are really well suited to that um in terms of you know in the near term as we seek to try to deploy more and more battery storage to be able to help uh integrate all of these renewables uh there is a question of is is that a role that hydrogen will um also play renewable hydrogen kind of those balancing services in the meantime as we try to build out all of that storage that short duration storage i don't see any other questions um in the chat so back to you great next slide please i'm gonna try to pick it up a little bit okay so the next study requirement is an assessment of the potential for coupling renewable electricity generation and renewable hydrogen production to increase resiliency uh or to provide flexible loads we have addressed some of these um certainly we're talking about rps 100 and one of the outcomes of overbuilding variable renewables i touched on is that as you add more especially with the same generating characteristics um so for example you know the time of day you know how they operate um or just even the same kind lots of solar for example each additional megawatt is less useful and less valuable than the one before it the marginal value is less and so to illustrate this this graphic shows what a glut of solar does to electricity prices in kaiso uh in the day ahead market which is especially interesting because mostly we've been seeing uh more negative pricing incidents in the real-time market not necessarily the day ahead market so up on the top um you see parabola indicating year by year the hourly solar generation in spring months in kaiso as this solar generation has grown year over year you see the blue below those are the electricity prices and you see those dipping farther into negative pricing territory and for longer as more solar is added negative energy prices might sound like a good thing and these are wholesale prices um but there are downsides and you know first off it's just a clear signal that the market is operating inefficiently and a second um you know certainly systems like kaiser they have a dispatch order where they favor renewables but you know there are a number of fossil fuels as well um that are on the grid that maybe can't ramp up and down as quickly and so renewables might be bumped at times in favor of those fossil fuel plants that can't ramp um and it can affect um you know if that energy is otherwise curtailed then it can affect uh production tax credit and facility uh contracts to provide a certain number of megawatt hours per year to say utility banking on that to meet their rps next side please so when you have that over building of renewables followed block by a surplus of generation your choices are to sell that power at low or negative prices or to curtail that power uh you know california has had some success at times of exporting a lot of that power to other states but you know certainly you're seeing those negative prices in that last graphic and then certainly higher and higher curtailment in the kaiso uh nearly every year what an ideal option would be um is to have flexible loads that consume that power on demand when there is surplus and so as we've discussed electrolyzers are such um a variable demand um and then if um you could also pair those electrolyzers with fuel cells uh to provide grid balancing services for short periods of time um though batteries um traditional batteries lie on are more suited to that but there is that possibility um so our findings here are similar to those enumerated earlier when discussing the rps 100 clean and that is renewable hydrogen from electrolysis can address a lot of these grid challenges posed by decarbonization um and that electrolyzers and fuel cells can work uh to support the more efficient deployment of resources in general electronizers can serve as variable and they can also be as discussed earlier cited with grid constrained renewable resources any questions here looking good so far all right like i said i'm going to try to hustle since i'm a little bit behind uh next slide please study requirement forecasted cost discussion with respect to how that might affect renewable hydrogen nope it's the next slide oh it is the slide never mind you might have heard that this is um an especially volatile time for energy prices in general and there are spillover effects associated with that uh for the near-term costs of renewable hydrogen and additionally there is you know funding from usdoe and just general rising interest in renewable hydrogen in general that has led to some technological advancements um and even breakthroughs uh some of which could affect future prices um you know this is all to say that the forecasted price of renewable hydrogen a moving target um and certainly one factor is policy i touched on earlier that potential for a hydrogen production tax credit it seems increasingly unlikely that uh that's gonna be in a bill passed by the federal government but it's still a uh and that would certainly lead to a lot more uh projects uh making getting over that financial um uh you know hurdle of of penciling out you know the conflict in ukraine certainly has affected natural gas prices and while this may not affect forecasted costs for renewable hydrogen it does affect how costly renewable hydrogen might be uh relative to natural gas and so certainly in in some jurisdictions in europe have announced recently that some renewable hydrogen production is reaching parity with traditional hydrogen production using natural gas as an input because of those volatility prices in natural gas and then um you know there are other confounding factors um for example economies of scale all of these that kind of affect you know how the hydrogen sector ramps up in the northwest but there are still a lot of analysis that we are drawing on um such as cost ranges where renewable hydrogen becomes competitive in certain applications such as heavy-duty transportation um in that sector the upfront costs and the total cost of ownership of emerging new models of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles um is going to be a big determinant of adoption and so we're still seeing um you know what those numbers are are going to look like um and we're also investigating you know the cost range at which renewable hydrogen could be an affordable compliance pathway for some of oregon's climate and energy programs like the climate protection program so not only for natural gas utilities uh but also some of those um sites that are going to have specific greenhouse gas emissions caps and then finally as the hydrogen industry in general moves forward to embrace a carbon intensity approach to categorization of it's possible that renewable pathways may not be as cost effective as uh you know potentially other lower carbon intensity pathways like for example natural gas steam reforming paired with carbon and capture and storage uh you know that could end up having a very low carbon intensity score um you know that given the you know the fact that most carbon capture and storage in the us is not operating at you know optimum levels you know it's not necessarily considered a fully commercialized how that would work you know there are a lot of questions as to whether or not that's the case but it's definitely something worth entertaining as to whether or not renewable hydrogen is not only competing with um traditional hydrogen um but also other low ci hydrogen that may end up being more cost any questions oh thank you keith for that uh resource on total cost of ownership yeah no questions just the helpful link from nrel thanks keith great so there's one um last study requirement to discuss and these are the barriers to adoption of renewable hydrogen those uh technological policy commercial and economic uh we've touched on a lot of these today and so i'll just briefly go over them here um but some of the regulatory barriers that maybe i haven't spent much time on include those around certification and tracking you know what is that going to look like for renewable hydrogen will it be similar renewable electricity or perhaps most likely it'll be more similar to a book and claim process used for renewable natural gas um you know how will we define renewable hydrogen what um what is pipeline injection going to look like and how will those development of standards pan out in terms of parity across states and federal requirements you know there's that scale of renewable electricity i mentioned needed for renewable hydrogen production versus renewable electricity needed for increasing loads from other decarbonization pathways you know there are ways as i mentioned that renewable hydrogen could um could address this but it's still um in some ways a barrier as well um we have relatively high wholesale electricity prices compared to some other western states here in oregon uh we're also experiencing some transmission congestion and citing new energy facilities in oregon can sometimes be challenging so all this adds up to questions around how attractive oregon is for renewable hydrogen project developers compared to other states that may not affect consumption as much because if all of our neighbors find themselves awash with renewable hydrogen development then certainly we would expect to get some of that supply but it's an open question",

        "text": " are some technical requirements within the committee review that the competitive committee uh members would be looking at um and odo would do and kind of open we're actually still listening feedback on this too this would be something if you had ideas but odo uh internal team would also kind of do a ranking of making sure that things are to industry standards and can kind of would um would be in like the things that are representing the application um are feasible and would work out so i think that would happen uh either concurrently um with the committee and that feedback would be brought back to the director but it wouldn't happen beforehand because by the rules anything that any applications that are complete you have to move forward to competitive review i'm not sure if that uh yeah i think that that answers the um i think we'll we have some technical aspects on the um the scoring guide the rubric that you all looked at last year or maybe in january um so it would still be there but there would be a separate technical review all right i don't see anything else in the chat i don't see any hands up or anybody off me jumping up in their chairs to to talk so we can move on to the next slide so one of the other things uh which gets into we're not sure how many hours per week um or sorry how how many applications we're going to get in or what that review process is as we're new processes kind of figuring out how to manage that workload for people who are on the committee uh so one of the uh things we wanted to propose for feedback and see if anyone had other ideas of how we could do this would be breaking down uh to a number of groupings of the competitive to having multiple competitor review committees if necessary um so the first scenario and these are the different scenarios of based on the number of applications we received so if the number of applications is under subscribed and we don't um you know there's more funding available than requested uh we wouldn't convene an external review committee uh we would do our completeness check uh internally and there's our feasibility training and then any applications that are complete and feasible would receive funding um first the second scenario which we hope we get at least two where we're slightly would allow us to have competitive review committee uh and they would look at all of the they would look at all of the um applications that we received and so the process for that would be oda would do our completeness review we'd do um the single evaluation committee would review all the projects and then as we talked about earlier deciding on maybe uh everyone ranks scores individually we have a consensus meeting um or something like that and those reviews would go to the director and then in the end we'd have kind of a wrap-up meeting with everyone to discuss um the results in the awards um that would work essentially the same process of review uh completeness review committee uh evaluation director um recommendations and an award for all these other ones but for the if it's moderately oversubscribed to keep the workload again for the um committee we would break up into multiple competitive review committees and that would be by the opportunity announcements so currently you know we could either do that by planning and construction opportunity announcements um or we could do it by all four of the competitive uh the construction and planning uh for energy resilience and um renewable energy systems and if we're largely oversubscribed it would break out the committees by that opportunity announcement like i just said uh extend that by one to two weeks and then potentially have other ways of breaking down the application um so maybe use a portion breakdown committees to review certain portions of the criteria um in the evaluation committee again with the idea being how do we best manage the workload to be able to stick to our timelines and get going so are there other ways that we could divide up uh you know or have competitive committees if we wanted to if we ended up hopefully with a you know an oversubscription um that would allow us to kind of moderate the workload one thing i'll just point out in the chat i got a thumbs up from another member um and hopefully brandi who put this into the chat you heard some some seeds of this as michael was talking on this slide because you typed this up before but um she just mentioned considering like breaking down the time commitment maybe in the interest form um by having like a training and then individual review and then ex like setting the expectation that we'd have that discussion and i think part of it is that we don't know how many applications we're going to get and i meant to kind of sprinkle this in when james was giving the program update we have some hints so i'll just kind of let you know the hints we're getting about how many applications we might have so far we've done we have a public webinar next week which is our first public webinar that we've publicized ourselves with 70 folks rsvp to attend that's next we um it includes a lot of sort of eligible entities but it also includes contractors like amaresco has been coming to these and is coming to that one for example just to give one example not to like give them an advertisement but i know that they're a contractor so when they see their email address i know where they are um but then the other the other hint is we've done i think webinars so far where we've gone to associations like the league of oregon cities and and had them invite folks and done a webinar for them and we've had a lot of people turn up at those we've had well over 100 people turn up to those and ask questions about if their project ideas would qualify and sometimes we've said no a lot of times it's been things that could work so that shows us that there's definitely interest out there the other hint we have is we um we're going to talk about timeline in a second james mentioned we sent out a survey about should we extend our application deadline for first review and we had 44 folks take that survey so these are hints that we have just to kind of help give some context to this but i think um yeah kind of figuring out the contingencies right depending on what happens so any thoughts on these um randy's idea sounds great it's like i think what we're thinking and adds a little detail to it and putting it making it public is great yeah i think it does sound like we have a lot of interest we're trying to be it's like exciting but also kind of nerve-wracking but yeah right i don't see any other um hands up or any other chats other than randy's saying it looks like we have a lot of interest thanks manny all right i'll go to the next slide all right thanks uh so as christy was mentioning uh we did send out a survey um we're launching online application portal on monday uh so on our original timeline that would give applicants uh less than three weeks to submit an application so we asked a survey of stakeholders which um hopefully some of you saw if they would um suggest that we extend the timelines for submitting applications which would of course then have a trickle-down effect to the review and award process um so the vast majority of respondents ex said we should extend the timeline and uh more than two-thirds said we should extend it by a month so here's what that timeline would look like uh if we extended for a month um bringing award extension uh the director's award process essentially into into september uh mid to late to september and uh so we just want to get some feedback on on that timeline and knowing that that would also kind of we would start the hope to start the second round of crap sometime in the late summer fall for the next round so this is our adjusted plan that we're thinking about so just wanted to take some time to see if there were any concerns about that well there are no concerns about that one last question i might have for the committee as we've talked about um we did just get a question from jackie does the director's award process include the contracting period or is that only the time required to send out the directors uh that does not include the contracting period that would happen after um that would yeah the director's award process would be sending out the announcements of who who's been selected and how much of a grant they would potentially receive um i will also just say um i know i think michael said it but i just want to make it clear that i think we're kind of figuring out how we can make sure that we time out the second review deadline so it kind of matches up with this one um so that there's like so we kind of do this and then we kind of do it do it again as soon as we can afterwards to try to get get the last i'm not sure exactly how much money we'll have left over but something like 11 or 12 million dollars still so we want to make sure we have that um also on our minds in case anybody is feeling like well what are we when are we going to do that second round all right i don't see any hands up or so one last question if we got two minutes here would just be uh and if people want to let us know later um we've got some great suggestions about time commands for the committee and if there's and we said we're actively working on compensation but there are any other support or materials that uh would be helpful for the committee that you know or you think we could use that would also be helpful feedback you can write that to us now or or later all right all right i'll move this on one thing that i just thought of that we haven't really talked about is engagement um we've done i think we i've talked to some of you about this but we've done what i've been calling sort of usual suspects outreach but as we hire on that final staffer for this program and we're also hiring on um somebody that's through our heat pump program that'll be like an outreach so we think that with we want to like start to get out into the community on that program and with this program along with it so just know that we're planning on doing sort of a not the usual suspects outreach approaches like a next step for the program as we hire on the rest of our staff for this and other programs do you know anybody who's really excited about incentive programs send them our way especially if they're really sunny people that like to",

you want to introduce yourself uh good morning my name is Paul Hines I am the program manager for a project search program with Albertina Kerr the provider agency oh uh my name is Moises I was a former intern at project search yeah just recently graduated great welcome hello thank you so each year around this time our ID Services Program partners with others in our community to promote respect for and educate others about individuals who experience ID we seek to raise awareness about the inclusion of people with ID in all facets of their community life as well as awareness of barriers that people with ID still sometimes face in trying to connect with the community in which they live we come before you today to share some information about ID services and then to also request uh that you adopt a proclamation proclaiming march to be ID Awareness Month in Maran County so in 1987 President Ronald Reagan proclaimed March as developmental disabilities Awareness Month March continues to be the nationally recognized ID awareness month and this year's awareness theme is a world of opportunities our Oregon ID system is built upon values of person centeredness self-direction Independence and Community inclusion for people with ID Oregon was the first state to close its institutions for individuals with ID and support people's right and choice to live in their own homes and community in 1990 approximately 1,200 individuals lived at Fairview uh Training Center here in Salem and the last residents left fair viiew in the year 2000 today all individuals with ID in Oregon live in a Home and Community setting in 2008 Oregon adopted an employment first policy to promote community based employment for people ID the employment first policy is a philosophy and a presumption that individuals um with ID can work in jobs fully integrated in their communities in Maran County more than 3,300 people receive ID services and live in their homes in community based settings Maran county has over 900 personal support workers and dozens of inhome agencies supporting individuals in their homes and throughout Maran County we have more than 350 24-hour residential and Foster homes that support people with intellectual and disabilities so in keeping with the world of opportunities theme I've invited guests to join me this morning to talk about a program operating in Maran County that is supporting people with ID to access a world of employment opportunities I'd like to introduce Paul Hines to share information about uh the great work Albertina Kerr and project search are doing in our local community and Moises seira to share a bit about his experience participating in Project search thank you Karen um so I will start with um a little bit about project search um project search is a 9mon internship that partners with a host business in the community um those host business can be a little bit of anything um I think we get to it in a little bit but um it is a 9month internship program that is designed for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and the idea is that we partner with a host business in the community that will provide mentorship and training and job skills throughout that 9month period so when the interns are there they are paired with a department and a mentor for three months at the end of that 3 months they transition into another department with a different Mentor doing a different job learning different skills for another 3 months before they transition again into a third job so by the end of the the 3-month program they have have three unique jobs to put on their resume they have a ton of skills that they've built um a lot of strengths that they've identified um barriers that we've encountered and overcome and how we overcome them so that what in the future when they obtain gainful meaningful integrated employment in their Community we have the the knowledge and the skills to support them to do their job sufficiently um and effectively and maintain that um so project search as a whole is not something that I designed or Albertina Kerr um it is a worldwide uh organization at this point um project search National started in 1997 at a children's hospital where a uh one of the charge nurses there um recognized that a lot of the people that were coming in were just doing so to have a place to be um and she kind of took that as an opportunity to say hey what is there any reason we can't teach some of these people job skills here here so that they can be employed at the hospital so she partnered with a special ed teacher and they designed this internship program back in 1997 um and today it has expanded it is in 48 US states nine other countries and there are 715 active programs worldwide we are just one of them Albertina Kerr has three programs in Oregon um and then other provider agencies and other entities do that support in other places um it was designed to address the critical unemployment rate um some numbers you may not be aware of um over 78% of individuals with ID are not employed in the community um however uh when interns complete the program um there is a 68% success rate that they are they find meaningful um integrated employment in their community that is non-seasonal at an adequate rate of paying um graduates from kurs program have gone through um and obtained meaningful employment in their community Through um uh agenes such as odhs we've supported people that work in mola County that work in Washington County um we have supported people that have been in their jobs for years that have gone through promotions that have gotten pay raises um and the the most important part um is that we have support multiple people that have transitioned out of Support Services is they no longer get support um through a provider agency in the form of like job coaching and on on-site support they are completely independent in their jobs and they they have built the routine they've built the job skills and they've gained independence to the point that they no longer need that um the the project search program provides a safe space to make mistakes it's one of my favorite Parts about the program is it designs a place where um the individ idual that go through the program are able to make the mistakes that they are unaware of without losing their job um we are there to provide those supports We Have Skills trainers that work with everybody to um learn the unwritten rules of work um some of the things that we're expected to know when we start working when to call out how to call out um what to wear what to say when to say it um we teach all of those skills through the program um in what we call our professional development hours so the program starts with 1 hour of um what we call it classroom time we don't like to call it class but um it is a you know lecture Le discussion-based um variety of topics we have um one day every day for nine months to talk about something different so we talk about a lot of varying job skills um communication technology health and wellness finances and uh career exploration where we learn about different jobs we have guest speakers come in and talk about the things that they do and the opportunities that their field offers um financial literacy time management um we uh educate people on how to use computers in a safe way um writing professional emails to their teams to update them on what's going on um how to navigate search engines how to use the resources that they have in front of them to build the skills in their job um and one of the things um one intern I want to talk about real quick he's not the turn this here uh not Moes but um one of my favorite things about uh this young man on the on the screen here Omar um early on in the program uh when he when he started last year um I taught him how to use a screwdriver he had never used a screwdriver before so I had to to teach him the placement how do you create torque you know how to screw this screw into uh this piece of wood to we were building a shelf um and in one of his rotations he was partnered with a um like a facilities department and by the end of it he was replacing washers dryers he was using power tools um he was and safely and he is actually in the process of being hired by that team right now um again this is somebody who had never used a screwdriver in his life is now going to work in a facilities Department doing maintenance and using power tools regularly um just really really great opportunities and and really great um uh just just opportunities for people to learn skills that they never thought they would learn or they never thought they were capable of um we kind of jump in there and and say yes you can here's how and and we teach those skills um we work with a lot of different host businesses um Banks hotels um government agencies uh restaurants hospitals um manufacturing plants there's there's any anything that has any kind of an organization that has different different opportunities where they might have office work admin Hands-On work you know facilities maintenance stuff like that um you know clothing laundering food anything where we have different opportunities where we can",

        "text": " off site to cut them down to smaller sites because it is very very difficult in these rural areas to get them on site and and there's been this oh sorry good you had a thought going so go ahead I was gonna say so because our repower had a very limited um so if we take a similar site in Arlington they exchange the hole in the cell they they put in a whole new cell a whole new generator ours had very few large components so we weren't able to the blades going off to be reused so everything had to go to be recycled right well there's there couldn't be any additional profit from the components coming down however other sites are able to reuse these blades so they can take them down within their portfolio based on based on how many new components go up they can take down their blades clean them and usually at other facilities um so our our contract didn't allow that but again that's a possible use for for some of the other blades that come down as if you have neighboring sites with the same technology you can use them well that opens up so many questions can't yeah so thank you chair so this exercise you were doing was the first time in Oregon the first time you guys have done it you were breaking the new ground uh inventing as your mental yes sir cool yes sir so if you go to the next slide so again we we had we had heard rumors of what what then happened and I I had to see it so I had to see it and so I did I went out to Missouri so these blades are from Shepherd Central I I I saw them get cut up and then I took an airplane and met them in Missouri so some of our blades are being transported by Rail and there was a log Jam of of components with the rail and so some had to be trucked so these ones were tracked so this is an abandoned rock quarry in Missouri and this is the only company that could guarantee that they could process 900 blades so what they do here you see as I mentioned so we we cut the blades up several times I guess strapping down like Pringles and this begins the process here of shredding so they're able to take each section of these blades they put them into their their big chip Shredder it was originally designed for wood and they worked with the manufacturer um our our some of some of the component is actually harder than wood so some of the some of the angles some of the tips are harder than wood and they were breaking their their Crusher so they had to reinforce it if we can go to the next slide and so this gets chipped down into several different and then is actually used in five local concrete facilities the the end product so the end product gets continually chipped down and shredded down into a um a fine finer product and it gets used in five of the local concrete facilities making making concrete and again so this is this is an hour and a half north of St Louis uh so serves a pretty large area on the Missouri but again the the only facility that I was able to take on the the amount of work and so they uh again a very little facility that they've got there and they were starting to receive um other blades from other states as well so they're going to continue to expand and be able to as well in the future expand into what the end product can turn into so several people have have ideas of trying to make them in the Press board or trying to turn them into pallets but but the scale isn't there so when these re Powers occur that you end up with hundreds of blades so a facility needs to have that space needs to have the large equipment to move those process them in in a pretty quick manner right so our goal was to have all of our components off-site as the reapower is finished we couldn't have our components sitting in the farmer's field as they're trying to plant their wheat over the winter so that again our blades are almost gone almost off site as the as the repower our winds down in the next month it'll be clear and they'll be able to process the rest of those all right sorry please so given that this is the only project that you answer where the only facility in the country that you're aware of that could take that ball into planes and now you said they're all sort of hit blades from other states do you have any concern that in the next several years it's more repositors and more recycling place it's done but there won't be a place that this facility is no longer evenly nominated it might not be places to go well no sir because we we are a very large site so they're not going to get 900 blades ever at once all again okay so I don't think that's an issue but they they were looking to expand as well so they had additional rock quarry ground that that they could hold you know they could receive it and hold it and then process as they catch up so um and again now that they've proven the concept I I also assume that other companies will try and get into that vein as well so you may get also some farmers and some some of their hurricane chippers try to process blades at the same time so this this is the first that we're aware of on this scale but I I assume other companies will try it in the future yeah Daniel so what percentage of the blade is wood can you go back to two slides let me zoom in at all do you think on the top there if not that's okay so I the exact percentage I I don't know I was just going to show you a couple so you can see a couple of the parts so a couple of the internal structures as they sit cross-section wise so so those are wood but yeah a lot of it's the fiber boss yeah from my concerns is Woody and right so so some of some of it gets processed and is actually the the heat source for the cement so they're able to yeah as right so you saw that they had multiple conveyor belts yeah so they had when I was visiting they had two piles and so it sounded like one was one one was actually getting mixed with and then they were using that as a heat source as opposed to their their fossil fuel resource for the the cement but that's how I understood the process to go yeah I mean I could see the fiberglass in concrete but the wood would you know reduce the Integrity of concrete yes sir Cindy yeah the question I'm curious if there you had mentioned uh well just as uh blades are are replaced with larger and larger plates is there a resale for the small smaller blades you feed um happening yeah so those blades could have been sold for a pretty penny yes ma'am so some some blades are worth more than others some blades hold their value some will have better craftsmanship a better manufacturer but but yes that that's definitely a market that's there the the secondary sale of older components because that that style was this this is actually wood from Brazil that style is not manufactured anymore so if a site had these blades and lightning destroyed a blade um just just any damage to a blade that's non-repairable that they would be out of luck so there is a market for certain types of blades definitely yeah that's funny um so and the blades are replaced is there a difference in longevity of the three replacement blades the first plates only last X number of years but the longer blades yes ma'am yes ma'am so we're expecting these new ones to be another 30 years from now so the original blades I I believe were a 20-year lifespan we're expecting the new blades to be 30-year so again that so the the repowering one of the one of the beneficial aspects is the the infrastructure of the site's already there so our substation is already there all of the roads and the cabling and the towers are there so if your Towers can sustain the longer blades and the more your infrastructure is already there so you can get 20 to 30 percent more out of your wind Park and another 20 to 30 for forty percent of the cost of a brand new build so you're you're piecing together older technology with newer technology that's going to last perform better and last longer yes sir good yeah thank you did you recoup anything in the in like selling the app it's the way I'm going to say is you know the the ground up fiber the scrap Valley is there scrap value then I recoup anything I'm not I'm not I'm not aware of that I'm I'm not in that so our our new authentic there then I'm not sure our goal was just to properly dispose of it recycle everything I don't know on how that works so with the cost of fuel it was the summer I had two thousand months oh yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure there was anything I'm not aware so I'm just curious um so and we certainly include conditions for recycling or resale of the material uh what your Lessons Learned in this project or the main premise is going forward what others could learn would be what we could learn yes ma'am yes ma'am I I think we've we've covered them already is being able to to fall back on our on our site condition that that our our contractor will follow these rules and then be able to coordinate and find the facilities that that can accommodate and certainly so having Portland here as a as a larger Hub was able to take a lot of the metals but they it did fill up so at one point we had to reroute and we were sending to a recycling facility to the east of us because Portland could not take any more of our components that's right yeah we haven't been on paper not BK Auto Salvage taken the cells and the yes sir yep so just having having the other infrastructure in place uh of again so depending on where your wind farm is being able to offload to reputable recycling facilities again not not easy to find in some cases I think the other point is is that we shouldn't limit the recycling opportunities to disposal we should you know we should look at you know are there opportunities to reap it up right you know I think we should be broad enough in our requirement that we allow Apple opportunity to explore that's good and my question on resale upstairs yeah that's a recycling than you would to have to ship it all the way to Missouri yeah yeah that's that's that's very good I think",

36 we have closed the public comment period our next agenda item agenda item G is the Nolan Hills wind power project proposed Order review proposed contested case Order review exceptions hearing possible material change hearing and public notice of possible hearing to adopt the final order Kate Sloan the Oregon Department of energy senior citing analyst and Aaliyah miles Oregon Department of Justice senior Assistant Attorney General natural resources section will be the general counsel of the general Council division are going to present Kate the floor is yours good morning thank you madam chair good morning Council for the record my name is Kathleen Sloan I'm a senior reciting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy and as mentioned we're here today to go over the Nolan Hills project and um I just wanted to start with the slide that shows Council the materials that have been provided to date just as a the council reviewed the draft proposed order in May and June of last year we issued a proposed order in August of last year August 4th and when we issued the public notice we also issued the public notice on contested case and a contested case was requested by Umatilla County and it will be covered in a another part of this agenda item um by both Patrick and Aaliyah miles from doj so I just want to make sure that in council's packet and in their previous uh receipt of materials you've received the proposed order the proposed contested case order that was issued in May the exceptions filed by Umatilla County and then also the responses to exceptions and we're going to go through all of that today next slide okay so this is just another overview of the agenda item for today I'm going to be presenting on agenda item 1A and 1B which is the actual proposed Order accepting the contested case proceedings that will happen in between so we'll initiate review of the proposed order on the application for site certificate excluding the issues evaluated in the contested case proceeding this will include a straw poll to preliminarily determine whether to affirm reject or modify staff's recommended finding effects conclusions of Law and conditions of approval from the proposed order Council will then review the proposed contested case order and hold in exceptions hearing Alia miles senior Assistant Attorney General with doj Department of Justice will be the legal counsel to f-sec since Patrick Rowe is acting legal counsel to Odo who is party to the contested case there will also be straw polls after each grouping in the exceptions hearing I will then resume council's review of the proposed order in agenda item 1B if based on the straw polls on the proposed order and the proposed contested case order there are any material changes Council will then hold a material change hearing which could occur today or at a future meeting if based on items one through four on the slide council is ready to make a final decision on the application you may do so and that decision may also occur at a future meeting if you so decide next slide so I'm going to launch into my overview of the proposed Order review next slide a little bit of this is just going to be a refresher for Council since it has been over a year since you reviewed the project so get you familiar so the Nolan Hills win project is proposed by the applicant which is Nolan Hills wind LLC which is a subsidiary of capital power Corporation it's a proposed solar and Wind Facility within a 48 000 plus Acre Site boundary and it's located nearby near the town of Nolan here in Northwestern Umatilla next slide just another slide that shows the micro siding Corridor I think what's of note here is if you look at the large Purple Patch that is the proposed approximately 18 196 Acres um that would be the solar component the solar array I mean it was the subject of a goal three exception in the draft proposed order and the proposed order the facility will also include up to 112 wind turbines and two potential options for transmission line which is kind of hard to see but one goes off to the West and then one goes a little bit north and when would it connect to the Umatilla Electric Co-op I believe is what that stands for Cottonwood transmission line and the other one would be an option to connect to a five mile BPA transmission line near the Stanford Stanfield line next slide so just to review where we've been what we've covered and kind of where we're at we're kind of in this hybrid area between the contested case and the final um we like I said we issued the proposed order in August of 2022 uh contested case was requested by Umatilla County we've had contested case proceedings that have been ongoing pretty much wrapped up this past month and we're here today to cover both the proposed contested case order the exceptions hearing and then Council can consider whether or not to move forward and adopt the final order next slide so I know it's a little hard to read but it is a summary of the procedural history on the site certificate the complete site certificate was submitted was deemed complete January of 2022 we issued the draft proposed order in April of last year um Council started its review in May of last year it was uh held open the record was help held open at the applicant's um to June 24th of last year where they were able to provide additional information in response to comments received on the record of the and then we issued the proposed order and notice of contested case August 4th and on August 22nd Umatilla County requested standing in the contested case and as I had mentioned it's been a contested case proceeding since then in May the proposed contested case order was issued in June exceptions were filed in June responses to exceptions were filed and now we are here to review all of the above and also a possible final decision next slide so the focus of the review today is really to cover what we would call substantive changes made in the proposed order from what council reviewed in the draft proposed order following council's meeting to review the draft proposed order the department must issue a proposed order in accordance with ors-469-370 subpart 4 taking into account consideration the comments of the council the public made it any public meeting or public hearing written comments received before the close of the record of the public hearing and agency consultation and the proposed order the department must recommend either granting a site certificate with conditions or denying a site certificate for the facility and as you know we recommended that Council approved the site certificates next slide the list here is a list of standards based upon our review of the proposed order and then changes made from the draft proposed order there were no substantive changes made based on comments received under any of these standards listed on the slide that is not to preclude counsel from having questions or wanting to cover any of these standards it's just that they're not the focus of my presentation today there were two standards that we made what would be considered substantive changes one is organizational expertise which will be my next topic of discussion the other one is under the land use standard which is where the issues in the contested case proceeding fell so that will get covered by Aaliyah and after I'm done with my presentation part on the proposed order but I just want to be clear with Council",

        "text": " that would then be addressed yeah any any development that comes in they're going to have to meet whatever the standards commissioner hel would you like to comment well you know I'm a big Rian area person and that really concerns me especially with the sound too so I I I don't know what to do Olivia did you want to okay well I I will make a motion here and see if that has any any traction to it um and I would like to move a condition that we construction um I don't know if there's a better way to say it conr griped structures um for other hard surfaces within the within 50 ft of the stream ban I would need a second to move to discussion second hel I don't know if I need to go say much more about the reasons for that except that um I think it is significant um to have a repairing and buffer in the Shel area that seems like not only just an opportunity but the correct opportunity given the contamination issues and to me at least there seems to be a good relationship between the Restriction um and the reason for the Restriction so that's that was why I suggested it are there any questions or on uh I do not disagree about the importance of reparing and buffers um I guess I'm struggling with our purview at this particular moment is residential versus perverted to Industrial and that is more or less our scope and then any if it goes back to an industrial then subsequent uh application for development or Improvement would then address the buffers or setbacks or requirements of set development at that time so I'm a little reluctant to impose conditions right now now uh as opposed to down the road upon further review if that makes sense that's very reasonable to me I understand that point of view other people have a point of view that they want to share or ask a question T yeah I would just say I'd be hesitant to um put that sort of condition on this uh without seeing it on a on a map you know like I be very interested to see what 50 ft looks like to this piece of property it's a good question I don't know if staff has the ability to that magic out but I see conferring I think we can pull a map up it's a very small lot so actually we're just measuring where is 50 ft on here um the lot Clos to the creek does have a building today so I think if there was a condition it would be on new development right so would the current building I also think it's worth noting that that entire lot is within the FL way the majority of the lot along the creek is in the flood way including the existing buildings so any modifications to that building or if it's torn down and replaced would have to come into compliance with the current standards which typically does not allow new structures in the flood W area of the creek and there's a setback from the ordinary high water mark on top of that is that is that accurate the 50 Foot riparian buffer is measured from the top bank and that's uh no removal of vegetation um in this area the 50 Foot buffer is kind of separate from the flood plane and flood way there's only flood way there's not additional flood plane outside of that area yeah so our code does not have a buil within the 50 ft today so in theory say this property got reson tonight and then they tear down that bilding to minut they will have to comply with all of our standards PL way whatever but we don't have a standard that we would apply that would be a 50 foot set back no Bild we might in the future as we're going to the go five project that would be a goal to get there within a few years but it would just depend on the timing of that but again flood flood way is very restrictive Laurel that was be my comment as well flood way development is much more restrictive where if you're placing any patent um fill structures you have to provide a pretty intense analysis showing any of that placement is not increasing the flood level so that is um that could be a challenge if the I feel okay how how big is the floodway or it just depends upon circumstances of they're all different um the floodway of this for reference on the um in the aerial image it goes about uh pathway into the building the existing building I feel like we may benefit from uh deferring this hearing and having some more information related to the questions is that something that's possible for us to do and I guess I will look over as well to um our applicant can be continued for sure contined that I do think we have a a different map we can bring up if you give us a few minutes where we can turn FL Lane for you it's just we minute break minute three minute break if you don't minders pulling that up decid minutes no I'm not okay we we'll take a three minute turn to our hearing so maybe Laurel can walk us through with this map is showing the property that's highlighted in blue is the subject property building and then we can show you the area second but let's do that did you want to see the well I think we have a question right so commissioner hel did you ask a question that we Tred to answer at this point I think I did I tried I just want to know what the floodway is as far as where it is on where it is on the property ex thank you thank you so the kind of green neon color that you're seeing the design area majority of the and you just highlighted the parcels blue so what Laur was saying is in this green area it's going to be very difficult to rebuild to meetly standards pav pavement or new building ter that's correct even modifications to the existing building um we look at evaluation where if you're improving building more than 50% it's current value it's come up to current standard so really any modifications could trigger and for the scale of the lot just lastly if I could that lot's only 100 feet deep from North to West from from north to south sorry so if you're trying to visualize how much is that green right 50t the whole lot itself is 99t I will withdraw my motion because by best response to that information so thank you for presenting Mr Beer brenelle I think there was one other concern kind of like a chilling effect on other people developing into mul family res with area uh and I'm wondering if if there is a condition or some sort of compromise that we can reach regarding that concern but but I do think it's a point that we should discuss a little more because if we are going to try to move that entire area into residential I do have some concerns about what industrial side right there might do and if that is going to hinder our goals our Salem um I do obviously have concerns about the Equitable nature of having a stand owner sort of pay a price for that but um is there a solution where they can have an El use that is consistent with their intentions that would maybe have less of an impact on other people want to turn that res I don't any thoughts Olivia do you have any parts I mean I that's a great question um potentially we could work with the applicant on a different Zone that would allow some industrial uses and not as intensive as IG um or we could work with with them to see if they would accept a condition maybe in bigger buffers or screening or something for new development I was just looking up to see what a 40 foot setback with scen with a wall along the property line between industrial and residential 40t yeah with a wall um that would be for new construction so the property um maybe Peter if you could turn the blood way off again the other property to the north it's part of the zone change request is is bacon I right there's a building but that's if the properties are directly adjacent what about across is that 15th Street you turn the zoning on so we can see welcome to a planner life we do all day long on and off the layers on this map so properties went directly to the North and then across the street I believe we're all owned by by just checking and again they have requested multi family um for like long-term plans of of having places to expand housing they're not clearly using them for housing right now yeah across the street I mean we just require General Landscaping in the front yard and again if they use the existing building or site the way it is none of that would come into play this are we sure we don't want to defer this C andow for more conversation between the applicant and the city it just there are so many questions here I'm not comfortable voting yes I don't feel like I have enough information yeah it's fine by staff if you want to continue it just be a motion to continue we might ask the applicants representative if they have a specific day that would work for it to come back we' like to continue with this specific day yeah dat okay do you guys want to tell me what date works for you all and then we can well we have one meeting in yeah so I think the next we've canceled March 5th although me to we have it otherwise um March 19th or after that for would be April 2nd be here March 19th but be a of these capable hands I'm sure great can I ask what the goal is between now and the next hearing so that you can select an appropriate date for that reason yes that's a very good question um I think that I think there are some concerns on the commission about the viability of that space um given the given the various um restrictions on it and how how it could be accommodated in terms of land use so land um industrial you know the selection of what kind of industrial sites could go there if we if we have um 4ot barrier for example what does that mean if we have flood plan restrictions what does that mean it seems like it would be it would be helpful for us um if you would come back with some more information on how that space can be used um and what are the restrictions that you're dealing withes that make sense okay and then just I just want to make it clear that my applicant doesn't have any any development proposals so the site is entirely PID there are buildings on site he is asking to just be able to utilize them in",

        "text": "with you as needed we'll give just a couple more minutes as people get signed on a few people had trouble signing on so okay well let's go ahead and get started I'd like to call the August 11th meeting of the Oregon global warming commission to order uh welcome to Commissioners and um to the public to our meeting we've got a lot to talk about today uh and some really really exciting Milestones to to discuss so uh really glad to be able to kick us off today we will soon become the Oregon climate action commission as part of the Senate Bill 522 that was designed to kind of modernize the commission and we'll be talking about the work plan associated with that work as well as the provisions that we're in 5 30. um so excited to talk about that as well as to put some new topics uh on the agenda for us to learn more about um so um first I just want to thank all of the legislative Champions who helped pass uh the Senate Bill 522 and 530 as part of that more comprehensive climate package um it's really great to to see the legislature's trust in the commission and willingness to give us new responsibilities and new resources so that we can be as effective as possible at advancing climate action work in Oregon then in particular I just want to thank senator denbro who worked tirelessly uh on getting Provisions from those two bills into the climate package but many others were instrumental in passing the provisions in these bills as well so broad thank you to the after a few introductory remarks uh we'll do the roll call just to give people a little more time to sign in um and get it online if they haven't yet um before that I'll just um make a couple comments about our the public comments that we received and um we received two public comments since our last meeting the first was from an elementary school teacher uh uh she wrote To Us on behalf of uh herself and some of her students who had done a project on sustainability and climate action and they found our website and thought it was very useful to their efforts and wanted to thank us for that and they also found a resource that they thought we might want to add to our website and so we will be doing a pretty comprehensive update of the website uh later this fall early winter and so we'll definitely think about how we can reflect uh their advice to us about including this green gray green guide or guide to going green at home resource on our website and just thanks again to Ms Platt and her students Jessica Jocelyn Adam and Madeline for sending a note of thanks to us it's um it was really nice to receive that the second comment was a request to add the commission to an organizational sign-on that was calling for an end to trade attacks on climate action I believe that trade issues are outside the purview as a of our commission but just wanted to acknowledge the request and appreciate that Outreach we will have time for public comment during today's meeting that's estimated to start at around 11 35 and people can sign up to testify Zach and Stacy do you want to remind folks what they need to do to let us know if they want to testify sure good morning Tim McDonald and for folks who are on the line who want to be able to provide some public comment there is a button at the bottom you'll see like a smiley face uh Emoji of sorts and next to that is a hand so you can raise your hand to let us know that you want to get in the public comment queue and then the other way is to potentially um just put a message in the chat to let us know that you'd like to be able to comment at that time great thank you and we'll come back and remind folks a little later in the in the meeting today about the opportunity um and just a reminder for Commissioners it is Can it can be a little challenging to see when you raise your hand so if uh for some reason I don't call on you please feel free to unmute yourself and and chime in with a question or a comment appreciate that um just looking at the folks that have joined us we have um a new commissioner um representative Levy I wanted to welcome you to the commission really or appreciate your interest in being on the commission I know you are uh in in transit and may not be able to respond right now or or later in the meeting but just wanted to give you an opportunity to say something if you'd like and and again welcome oh thank you very much I appreciate it and you probably won't be able to hear me much of this meeting so I'll keep myself on mute thank you for joining us look forward to working with you me too and then also wanted to um acknowledge and introduce Abby Reeser um our new Linda she's going to be providing administrative support to the commission and I just wanted to welcome her she's jumped right in and is helping the voting members of the commission fill out some paperwork with excellent Door Service uh so we really appreciate having you on board Abby in and look forward to working with you do you want to say a quick hi yeah hi everyone very excited to be here and get working with you guys so now I will go ahead and do a roll and starting with the voting members I have uh commissioner Ford here commissioner Reitman here commissioner Jackson commissioner Jackson I think you're on mute if you're trying to say something yes welcome thank you thank you commissioner after excellent did I miss anyone who's a voting member I don't think so we have a number of non-voting members uh senator dembro OK commissioner Decker hi I'm here director Bateman good morning I'm here and then um sitting in for uh director felden I'm I'm here good morning everyone good morning and I'm just going back through the list again we've got a number of staff from the Department of energy who will be presenting to us today that are joining and Suzanne Carlson is here representing the Department of Transportation thank you thanks everyone and welcome uh I wanted um oh apologies um and Mary morelands is is sitting in for commissioner Anderson apologies had you on the list but missed missed that chair McDonald excellent thank you Alan um and with that um I wanted to open things up for commissioner updates and I'd specifically ask commissioner Decker to give us just a a snapshot of the work that is being led by the puc and related to implementation of House Bill 2021 and the reviews that the puc does of the integrated resource plans with the agencies uh well we really want to be able to highlight this work in more detail at a future meeting this fall but I just given that the importance of the work wanted to give commissioner Decker a few minutes in our updates just to kind of make sure we're all aware of the good work they're doing uh and and so is the public this was identified in the roadmap in recommendation one just the importance of making sure that this work as well as the work that Deke you has been leading on the CPP or well-resourced and and advancing well so commissioner Decker do you want to just say a few words this morning and then take more time than a future meeting uh hi folks uh Megan Ducker I'm the chair of the Oregon Public Utility um as a reminder HB 2021 requires Portland General Electric and Pacific Corp to plan to 100 clean by 2040. and I'm going to cover also deq's climate Protection Program which I think is seen as deqs but as a reminder it requires Gas Utilities to meet and aggressively decline in cap on ghg emissions so taken together these activities cover a very significant amount of the total ghg emissions reductions the state is trying to achieve as you might remember from the giant wedge they represented in that Tigger report that I think the chair was referring to I can give a very brief overview of utility planning and what the puc does there in the time I have here but the message I really want to leave is that well the puc's oversight of utility planning can guide utility actions toward compliance with with these meeting the goals of these policies you know slashing emissions quickly with affordability and equity is not in in my view something the puc can just make happen through regulatory enforcement alone I can't overstate how important it will be for people like those on this commission who care about successful climate policy to understand utility plans around these programs to acknowledge that the real hurdles that they demonstrate to making HB 2021 and the CPP successful and and to be really thoughtful about where additional continuing state and federal support can can make a difference so super quickly the puc has for decades required comprehensive forward Planning by utilities electric and natural gas and we call these integrated resource as the chair mentioned we require these roughly every two years so that the actions that the utilities are taking in the near term reflect you know the best current understanding of what the future um right now the puc is in the middle of its review of the first plans that deal with HB 2021 for the electric utilities and the climate Protection Program for the Gas Utilities um there are currently opportunities to learn about and get involved in commenting on these utility plans in dockets for each individual utility at the puc decisions are expected largely to come in the first half of 2024 and I want to note that the next cycle of plan development will begin from there so each utility involves interested people in their planning efforts to for you know to one degree or another and and those that that engagement while the utility is developing the plan is frankly as important as telling the puc what you think about the plan once it's completed so utility websites do detail opportunities for engagement at you know more and less technical levels there are certainly efforts by the electric utilities as required by HB 2021 to engage participants at a less technical level than we've been accustomed to maybe at the puc over the years so hopefully that is enough of an overview to get you interested and uh maybe we'll have the opportunity to provide more information going forward thanks thank you commissioner Decker and I appreciate um kind of correcting that notion that that uh the CPP is not just a DEQ effort but a really important part of your work as well so thank you for that and um kind of a good segue to this topic the commission the next topic on our agenda maybe before we go there",

        "text": " that it must be submitted with a copy of the officially recorded title transfer instrument deed warranty deed or contract showing the legal description for the parent parcel no such document was included with Maring uh with the friend's application Maring County's planning division uh says that it won't accept incomplete applications but so far this application has not only been accepted but has been approved at every stage the second issue has to do with a requirement this is an application for a conditional use permit to the extent that Maring County believes it holds an easement over the disputed property which would which would entitle it or the friends to develop the property without my client's approval Maring county code requires that the application be signed by an authorized agent of maring County no Maring County official has signed the application Luba has already reversed a decision of maring County for the same application and the same applicant for failing to comply with the code signature requirements here we are again 3 years later and the application still lacks the required signature for the third issue is that the application lacks documentary evidence to support the friend's self-serving statements there are many instances in the friend's application where they say that a Criterion is met because someone else said so or because they have permission from another entity we've repeatedly raised the question where is that evidence the hearings officer just took the friend's word as sufficient to satisfy its burden and it's not not friend Council just said that they did submit um expert testimony in the record to uh to support the Criterion um I'd encourage you to look at the application itself there are there's no sworn testimony um at most there are a few email exchanges with different entities all of which were are ambiguous and don't actually satisfy the required just to orient you to what we're talking about if you're not familiar on this slide is a picture a Google image an aerial view of the property down here is the bville general store which is operated by the friends of historic bville this is the disputed property as it looks today Julia Kramer's property is down here shayo Pam's property is here and Miss masel Cheryl Mel's property is over here I'll remind you that the parties are all involved in litigation in Maring County Circuit Court about their rights to the disputed property in connection with that litigation we've received response to request for admission and we've attached those responses to the appeal and have asked that they be included in the record the first is positive issue in this case is that Maring County does not own the disputed property you don't have to take my word for it because on this slide are the admissions of Maran County where they admit to that very fact so Maring county has admitted that my clients are the fee title owners to the disputed property it is also admitted that fee ownership of my client's properties extends to the center line of the disputed property Maran county has admitted that the county does not own the right of way unless the county owns the fee interest in the the land over which the right of way exists and it has admitted that the fee title owner my clients not only own the land but everything Below on or in reasonable airspace above the land including trees or other natural growth finally Maring county has admitted that it has never compensated my clients or their predecessors for the Public's use of the property so these are all now Undisputed facts between the parties and as such I'll ask that you keep them in mind as we discuss the remainder of this application on this screen is the only basis that Maring county has pointed to when asked what right it has to Grant the friends the right to develop the disputed property and again to orient you just a little bit we're talking about this strip of land right here but Avenue this is Miss Kramer's property Miss putnam's property Miss Mel's to provide just a little bit of historical context the site was once a private commercial dock in the mid to 1800s that commercial dock operated until 1908 and then it was it wasn't used any longer because railroads were introduced and it wasn't needed anymore the area became overgrown and was no longer used that is until 2015 107 years later when Mr Williams president of the friends of histor Beville requested that Maring County add a new park to the site because the park would supplement the Beville store which is struggling because the community needs a park and because the county doesn't have many parks in the northern part of the county so this would be a nice addition these are all quotes from Mr Williams and the sources of those quotes are all in our written submissions Marin County staff have said that Marin County owns an easement to this over the disputed property there is zero evidence to support that conclusion again the only document that Maring County relies on is this plat recorded in 1871 at most this plat demonstrates that the streets would provide adjoining Lots access to their properties there is nothing expressed or implied by this plat that would lead to the conclusion that the disputed property could be used as a recreation site extending in to the river yeah and hang on just a second commissioner Willis what's a public RightWay so what they're what the county is saying is they have an I just want to know what what is when you're understanding what's a public right away if if there is a public RightWay somewhere what does that mean a public RightWay could be a road it's it's it's property that's been dedicated to the public for the Public's use for what purpose if is it for any use well like if there's a public if there's a public right of way can can the public do anything they want no so what can they do what what right does the public have in a public right of way the scope of the right of way is determined based on whether the right of way is Express WR meaning it's written some down somewhere in an easement or in a deed or whether it's implied that determines the scope of the right of way but what is it what is a public right of way what what does it do what what rights does it confer and to whom if land is dedicated to the public by the owner of the land the public can use that property in a manner that is set defined by the scope of the public dedication so if for instance there was a road and that was a public right of way then the public could use that road to travel on is that correct correct except I will say the Oregon appell courts have said that a plat like this is insufficient to demonstrate public dedication and easement this is so that might be getting too deep into I understand your I understand that that you don't think that this is a public right of way but if it is a public right of way then the public has the right to travel on it is that correct it depends on the scope of the right of way do you know of a public right of way that the public does not have a right to travel on have you ever heard of a public right of way where the public doesn't have a right of way I I can't answer that question because the scope of any right of way is going to be limited by it by its scope so is it expressed is the right of way expressed somewhere or is it implied if it's if it's a plaque it's implied unless it comes with expressed Lang language about what that right of way is supposed to be so I understand that this that in dispute is whether or not this is a RightWay but have you ever heard of a RightWay where the public doesn't have a right of way isn't that what it means to have a right of way I can definitely think of situations where land could be dedicated to the public but the public may not have access to it so for example would it be called a right of yes for example there could be areas of land dedicated to the state of Oregon National a park for example and the Public's not given unlimited access to that Park they are given certain access stay on the trails or the or it's closed completely to the public but that doesn't mean that the land does not belong to the public or to the governmental entity to whom the land was dedicated but we're not talking about public lands generally we're talking about public right of ways right so in a in a specifically a public right of way do you know of a public right of way where the public doesn't have a right of way isn't that by definition what it is the property isn't owned by the public it's still owned by a entity so so sorry I I think I'm trying trying to get some clarity on what's a dispute and what's not a dispute so do you dispute the definition of public right of way do you think that that's not clear no what we dispute is the scope if any ex if a right of way exists we there's a dispute about the scope of it everyone agrees that my clients own this property so to the extent Maring County believes it has an easement over the property the question is what's the scope of the easement that's that's all that's an issue you can call it a RightWay you can call it an easement really it's the same thing it allows someone else to enter onto private property and do something but is wait excuse me can I just interrupt here and I really appreciate that this discussion well I'm not a lawyer and it's way over my head it's it's a bit troubling to me that we're even having it because this doesn't appear to have anything to do with the actual permit criteria which is what we're here to discuss so we we need to not be doing what something the circuit court is trying to do on their behalf we need to really focus on this this application so we might need to get advice from our legal council just to be clear Jane I would just ask micophone um to the extent that you're you're talking about easements what J hang on I'm sorry yeah what criteria um are you um objecting to are you saying that we have that uh the applicant hasn't met the burn approve on so if you're talking about the FL I'm talking about the flood plane and the criteria that the hearings officer um uh based her order on which criteria does this testimony apply to this is a foundational issue okay so not not because we're here on a permanent application so this is a lan use hearing and so I guess our request",

meeting so that's great we already have all of our dates and we're getting ready to set our last planning committee date any day now so um we can go ahead to the next slide i think at this time a lot of folks are pretty darn familiar with webex but um you can raise your hand there's a raise hand button at the bottom of the screen you can also hover around by your name and there's a raise hand button just remember it looks a little bit more like a raised fist than a raised hand and then um you also um can see the mute button and start the start stop video buttons as next page and we don't need to go over this one we've already probably we should be good on that front so just as a reminder on these meetings um i've already said a lot of it but um that you know we really want to have a great conversation today be respectful of each other one thing in addition to these work group agreements that we've talked about before i just want to mention that um you know one of the things that's exciting about the study is it includes a chance for recommendations from this group so i really hope folks will be thinking about not just this is a place to you know recap those barriers that you know we've we've all known about for a while but thinking about solutions too so i just kind of want to encourage folks to think about things from that that venue of like how could this barrier or complaint that i have be turned on its head and into something that could become a recommendation from this group at the end of the day um if you have technical issues linda ross is the best person to contact in the chat and we'll move on to the next slide and then i put a link into the agenda too so you can always find it during the meeting by going to the top of the chat but we'll be going over the background we have a long list of stakeholder perspectives so just know that i'm going to be running a tight ship on 10 minutes for those presentations so everybody be mentally prepared for me to use my stage hook as and then we'll do a break and then we have a nice nice chance for a breakout conversation about the top three barriers and then the top three opportunities that you want to make sure make it into the report we'll report back out from the breakouts a discussion of main takeaways we'll talk about next steps and then we'll close out the meeting um and we'll have that public comment right there at the end um one note just for everybody right from the top we have this meeting today june 3rd our workshop number three will be on the 28th and then our june 28th and then our last meeting where we'll talk about possible recommendations and kind of wrap everything up will be on july 28th so just remember the 28th from here on out you should be in good shape next slide please oh this is just the list of who's going to be presenting yep and i don't mind um picking it up from here great thanks we're starting to get into some of the content um i think the next slide is a little bit of background but um yeah we've put together a a really great group of speakers today and what we've found in these discussions especially when we start talking about barriers is that um you know sometimes the the discussion can be a little hot it can be a little destructive and we just want to recognize one that that many of the barriers to development anything but including energy projects are there for a reason um that we want to be smart about and that barriers or or gates do serve a purpose but with that said there are barriers that maybe are not serving the the function that was originally intended or perhaps or serving a function that's become a little bit outdated and that's where i think we'll have this opportunity for recommendations the reason that we have such a great list of presenters today is that we really have a wide selection of real projects that have encountered real barriers or in some cases overcome barriers and discovered opportunities for development what we really want to do is stick to real world factual information today no speculations um about you know what people might be trying to do what's um you know what i heard somebody did anything like that we're gonna stick to real world examples for about the next hour and a half and really get a lot of um direct input from our our speakers and hopefully this will you know get us into a good discussion about these barriers and thinking about how we may overcome those barriers um you know just keep that in mind as we go along that we really are trying to come up with these real examples in the field where we've where we've seen opportunities and barriers both being encountered project developers all across the state yeah moving on the you know thinking about this study and the opportunity that we have here both with the presenters but also with you know the the heavy hitting team that we have in this work group we have a real opportunity here to come up with these first recognition of places where policies could be changed and then turning those that recognition into some recommendations in the report and so just keep in mind that we have this objective of you know objective and opportunity to share a lot of this very timely meaningful information with the legislature and that that's what this report is all about and we're right in the middle of it now so this is our chance to get this right so before we um before we go into the perspectives from the project developers i'm going to share some information most of it was already presented or shared on the website in the background document so i'm not going to go into tremendous in a lot of this material some of it we talked about in the last meeting but to set the stage for the discussion i think it's worth um just recognizing some terms and um you know recognizing the the policy landscape within oregon within that document we've already developed a short list of known barriers as well as a short list of known and these lists are short because we haven't had this meeting yet and really what we want to get out of this meeting is to expand these lists of barriers and opportunities and dig in where where we can potentially overcome some barriers and potentially to unlock some other opportunities for project development in the future and especially where that development can bring to local communities this study is limited in in scope to up to 20 megawatts which in many oregon policies is referred to as small scale and so that's really where we're looking for these opportunities is um these smaller scale less than 20 megawatt projects that can bring",

        "text": " habitat it allows uh a discretionary approach proposing um that type of development which entails a detailed environmental report and a more intensive type 3 review it's flexible but it's rigorous um when other options are not available and it requires a site assessment an impact evaluation and a mitigation plan to offset the impacts and again it must meet or exceed the intended level of resource protection uh as the lightly limit decision so we had heard that there was a concern about taking care of trees on on individual properties um and they and the need for an easy process to handle um handle those situations so we have our Draft rules provide for this type of process with uh an on-site disturbance area allowance of 5,000 square feet uh around of impervious area um provided the lot does contain at least uh one or more existing residential dwellings or any trees that are located within 10 ft of an existing habitat a habitable building are remove are are able to be removed by right and if the property owner needs to remove trees outside of that area then they need to follow the tree retention and replacement requirements for the Upland wildlife habitat finally uh other proposed amendments include a process to allow adjustments to certain development standards including lot areas setbacks or landscape requirements and that's to facilitate the preservation of significant habitat providing in in incentives and flexibility for um development sites to preserve more habitat a map modification process when there are uh issues with uh uh where the uh significant habitat has been mapped on an individual property that they believe is inaccurate and then there are conforming amendments related to CDCC sections including refining a definitions and and clarifying some of the exclusions for tree cutting requirements at this time um staff is recommending that the uh that we take your questions uh and get your feedback and questions at this time and then uh conduct a public hearing we ask that you continue the hearing to August 21st so that we can have further discussions and deliberations and uh we are proposing that we our consultant team will review um the requests for U map changes thank you very much for that U M Miller uh Commissioners questions commissioner will um I just had a quick question about that last statement you were requesting or suggesting that we at the end of tonight's uh meeting we continue for the purpose of um further discussion yes and an open hearing yes so tonight we might hear from the community and there might be some information that you take in that you want to deliberate about and or may have questions about that we would like to get back to you at the next hearing for so to make sure that we um have a thorough discussion of any any issues arise and And to clarify So based on expectations of public uh comment you're recommending that we also extend that hearing for further public comment at the next one or would the would the record be closed no uh we would we would be open for uh further testimony okay just that's good to know okay thanks and our assumption was that the Planning Commission since the package was so large that you might have a lot of questions that we would be able to answer a lot of them probably tonight but maybe some of them we couldn't um and and that you might hear things from the public that you wanted to learn more about so our thought was you might want to continue because of that if you were ready and you felt that you you wanted to move forward that would always be possible commissioner Monte Blanco thanks uh that was a super helpful presentation really appreciated it could you go to slide 41 oh gosh I'm G put my glasses on here it's like two 42 just one more um can you explain number one to someone who doesn't have a planning and land use background please sure so in in this instance there might be a property owner with a a house and some Upland habitat that is on their property we're we are recommending that we have a 5,000 square foot perimeter really it's about the size of a of a regular lot Suburban lot is about 5,000 square F feet to allow for any tree removal that they uh request um kind of right and as long as there's a dwelling as a type one process so if I'm a homeowner with a lot of land I'm allowed up to 5,000 feet where I can take out a tree yes that's than thank you I appreciate that very much I the idea there was that we did hear from a lot of um of property owners concerned that they wouldn't be able to say take out a tree that was next to their home that they were afraid might fall on their home um and so we wanted to provide at least a a a a limited area within which they they could remove trees um while the larger area would still be preserved that makes sense thank you Kaiser hey Ju Just oh yeah okay I'm good uh just to uh follow up on that um and not to get too far in the weeds help me understand something because I I had partially the same question but I think it's just a little different so what we're saying here is all right we're gonna have a 5,000 foot uh zone or or or box that we're going to allow people to remove from what I wasn't totally understanding there is is that so is it based on an existing home that is situated there and then you take the 5,000 foot box uh you know vertically or horizontally from it or is it literally you can find a 5,000 ft box somewhere on the property and designate that area as the place where you want to remove trees I it just was a little unclear to me and I I I I think you mean it's supposed to be including whatever home is there right it needs to include the home so it needs to include the home and then are the boundaries of it again when I say vertical I mean depth or width or is it just depth from from the front is it from the front front facade of the house is it from the drive where kind of what's our boundary on it it's of the choosing of the prop property owner what 5,000 square feet they want to use so it's a box kind of like a like a lot would be right you have your but you could you could use the front part of your house as the starting point go all the way back um till you get 5,000 squet okay or you could use from the from the street side in front of your house as long as your house is included in it and go back that way if you want it for example right okay and again same way if you wanted to go horizontally along the street Frontage with your house in it just got to include that house right perfect thank you I'll just read from the section it's 42271 um and it does say that the disturbance area um is a contiguous area so it's not separate areas um it includes existing and proposed structures impervious areas Landscaping um and then tree removal within that area um and it would include areas 10 feet from the building hi um yeah I just wanted to clarify it doesn't actually have to be a box so it's a polygon and um the idea would be that the applic so if you had a barn a shed a tennis court other improvements on your property you would draw the polygon and a house you would draw the polygon such that it would include those areas right and then within that polygon you could remove uh the trees so in order to protect those not just protect the house from again you know tree damage but but also perhaps other structures or you know improvements so it yeah does not have to be a square could be a more organic shape that's helpful I appreciate it thanks commission fry following up on the topic your hand here um so that but that does require a type one application and and homeowners being able to navigate a little bit the county process um with with this um with these regulations there are going to be some some different changes and I'm sure there'll be a lot of um help along the way through our on our website and things about how how that process will work and kind of thinking ahead a little bit how that's how to navigate yeah um I would add that we did look at whether we could make that an out andout exemption right so that there would not require a type one it there were advantages to making it a type one and that there would be a record of that decision so that when the person has established their 5,000 square F feet they come in to do the tree removal later it's like it's within their approved 5,000 square fet everything is good and so um it there were a lot of like logistical reasons why a a very simple permit was a helpful tracking tool um and um I think we felt that it was a little bit complicated to try and write it as an exemption and have it you know be something that the county could then um follow up on right should somebody expand beyond that 5,000 squ example so there were trade-offs there but I think that the the permit gives the county the ability to track that and the homeowner as well okay commissioner Rosenberry thank you chair I I want to make sure that I'm understanding this thoroughly the draft requires a permit request so there's a permanent record of which 5,000 square ft been assigned so that can't be changed for two years five years is there a permanency related to to this right it's a it's a one time 5,000 square feet on that site so you know presumably if the applic know somebody potentially would not have to take all their full 5,000 I suppose on their first request um they could identify a smaller area and come back in for additional like expanding that area later um but the intention is that it's it's it's a one-time as if it were an exemption but it's got the type one approval um Again by way of a a means of tracking that decision and then does that follow through to a second owner of the property yeah it the approvals follow the land um would you go to slide 39 39 that's it thank you um I wasn't understanding how this um first you identify a certain area and then within that area the tree canopy covers okay I I had one other question um could you talk a little bit about es and where that came from and does it have a history of working well and",

        "text": " conditions of approval is really important and I'd like that specificity so carrying it forward to other proposed projects I think is a good idea and and tightening up the conditions as counselor Condon mentioned as we get more experience so I think this is a step in the right direction so thanks thank you so we do have three new recommended conditions in that regard and really they are tied to the phase of the facility as council member fire mentioned one of the things I've learned is that oftentimes the the certificate holders team shifts from construction to operation so having those two broken out I think is helpful again reinforcing that they have demonstrated qualifications and expertise to do the work that needs to be done and having someone on site that really is uh or on on board that is really responsible for for tracking and managing those site certificate conditions whether it be in construction or during the operations of the facility in the long term so the next standard is the land use I think Council will remember that the question that came up over the addition of the 169 Acres was really related to the water rights the fact that it's irrigated agriculture we talked to the county the county provided as the special Advisory Group provided comments um that that were in support of the water white transfer for similar use um and that as long as there was no net loss of irrigated agriculture within that County as a result of this transfer of a water right from the parcel for the area e to another area where we can use it for a similar use the landowner has indicated in a letter that they will transfer that water right um and also that was a comment that was made during the certificate holders comments during the public hearing was to assure that yes this is something that they will do they have committed to but to make sure that that happens we have recommended a new land use condition number eight which basically States just that that if they opt to build within this area e that they will provide us with documentation that the water rights associated with that area have been transferred for similar use within Lake County to ensure that no net loss to irrigated Act I don't know if anyone has any comments questions on that otherwise I will move on and under retirement and financial um because there is a change in the facility component and also a need to update it for current um 2023 dollar values based upon those we came up with a number that is just a little bit higher than 38.1 million for retirement and we do have a letter on file that says that the certificate holder should be able to acquire that 40 million dollar Bond we didn't make any other uh recommended changes to that but I see council member Condon has a comment thank you Vice chair how and thank you Ms Sloan um just a question I'm curious I probably could have looked this up but as Heffernan Insurance Brokers uh provided a bond for us just a point of information apparently not that we're aware of okay thank you but they are on our approved list for for financial institutions so they just haven't provided a bond before thank you thank you council member Condon and so standard is the Wildfire prevention and risk mitigation standard I think of note is that this standard had not been fully adopted at the time that the site certificate was approved so there are some recommended changes in the draft proposed order to reflect the new newer the existing Wildfire prevention arrest mitigation standard and so it's part of it is to move what had been included under the Public Services existing conditions that kind of wrapped up in an emergency response things like fire to pull that out of there and make it much more specific to this newer standard and and provide some more robust language and recommend recommended language to reflect this new standard to address Wildfire risk so the first thing was to replace that public services condition and we there's two parts to it there's a 4A and a 4B and so basically we have recommended a wildfire condition to reflect both 4A and a separate condition for 4B and so they're very similar but one applies to operations of the facility and one provides to that prior to Construction Construction so the language in here is similar to what we have asked for more recently in Wildfire mitigation plan the certificate holder is required to submit for Council approval a final Wildfire mitigation plan so we have a draft in the draft proposed order but it is subject to finalization and there will be additional information that needs to be included and in that are some of these conditions so let's give you a chance to read it and it keeps going on to the next slide and again this is to be more consistent with how we're addressing this newer standard in our site certificate condition counselor sure thank you Vice chair Hal so this whole Wildfire mitigation um plan review and approval for us is a a new thing right and as I was reviewing the material um it wasn't long after the Lahaina um fire and one of the things that I don't see in our conditions or really anything else we've discussed is any notification uh process or procedure for adjacent landowners should an and I'm wondering if there is an opportunity to include a condition for an alarm system or notification system that you know by the time the fire department is called people come to the site in maybe a while and so is there an ability to put a condition on that there be some sort of alarm system uh should an ignition occur so can I ask a clarifying question so I make sure I understand is it is it more aligned with like oh my gosh there's a fire we got to tell people right now or is it like an after like an after action response where there's been an incident and then they're going to notify the adjacent planes it's at the time at the time yes okay yes so Vice chair Hal councilor Byron so it looks like in subsection five There's an opportunity to require some sort of no notice to adjacent Property um I know in Deschutes County you can sign up for Wildfire alerts or other safety alerts but maybe leave it to the developer in conjunction with the County Emergency managers to figure out the best way to identify property owners I know in Christmas Valley um they're the properties are really big there aren't a lot of structures but there may be other resources at risk some of the property owners may be absentee but figuring out with the the County Emergency managers the best way to notify so keeping it fluid to not say you must call everybody or you must text everybody but to at least have the applicant explore with the local governments what that best way to notify Under The Heading of minimizing risks to public health and safety does that make sense no that I think that's a really good comment and I appreciate it I think that typically because we are requiring this preparation of the Wildfire mitigation plan I think that in the plan that's where that information could be included it would logically be included and you know so much of the response is that interagency whether it's the incident command system or you know the county state federal fire fighting teams I think that that would make a lot of sense I don't have any other questions about that comment but I think it's well taken um thank you and I think that the existing standard allows for that to be incorporated into a plan and then similarly um like I said these are almost identical language but one was for prior to construction and this one is prior to operation so this is the one that would replace the existing Public Services condition for B to make it more specific to this standard and also apply to the operations of the facility and again it has that same language that identify those preventative actions and identify procedures to minimize risk I think that's where it would logically fall in there but I think it's a really good comment and we'll make a note of that for sure and then the last two are basically uh kind of follow-up conditions to the requirement of the the Wildfire plan is that it be adhered to during during construction and operations of the facility and that Council will have the ability to to make comments on that so I believe this I'm not sure if this is the last one or not so um under citing standards for transmission lines again it's because of that change from 115 kilovolts to 138 that we just needed to recommend changes to that language to say exactly that um so that it's consistent with the current proposed design okay so we issued the draft proposed order on August 1st and opened it up for public comments um which closed at the end of the public hearing on August 24th um the department has recommended in the draft proposed order that Council fined based upon the preponderance of evidence on the record and with recommended new amended and existing site certificate conditions that the site certificate may be amended as requested we are also recommending that Council find that with existing recommended and new conditions the facility with proposed changes will continue to comply with that general standard of review so we have proposed in our draft proposed order that uh Council approve I'm going to go next into the public comments that we received so we received one written comment submitted through the comment portal during the public comment period it was received on August 21st there were no other comments made by the public um other than what was made on the record during the public hearing and just really briefly going to overview council's been provided with this comment in their packet before the August meeting it's also incorporated into uh the comet the comments that are listed that we will include in the proposed order basically just the commenter submitted uh a copy of a paper that she helped write and in general kind of anti-renewable or at least calling out Renewables it's not necessarily being environmental but these comments honestly were not specific to this project it even said that in her submental not specific to this facility this draft proposed order or the amendment request and so just want to emphasize that since our response to comments is is tied to uh being tied to a standard or the facility or the requested Amendment so for informational purposes it was and then our summary of the comments that we received at the public hearing as I mentioned we held the public Hearing in Christmas Valley on August we counted 11 members of the public that were there and an additional seven individuals attended through the WebEx so it was available via WebEx as well the certificate holders representative did make",

invited to attend and Beaverton School District did not although they are still uh okay with sending written comments if they would like I'm just I was just curious yeah relatively speaking Yeah yeah just you know when you look at any of these numbers in the overall you know numbers not huge how many attempted uh no one no one you went over 52. well you know I you have to hold my feelings weren't too hurt because I figured well we did a great way I they all saw pretty much this presentation and saw the invitation letter which explained it so if there were no questions somebody coming from far away to Beaverton City Hall in the middle of a Friday whatever or was it Monday they can still ask questions so I have one last question given what I said earlier about data centers and economic development zones what given your that you're the part of the EC Dev team with the City of Beaverton and therefore immersed in all things at Kev what are the chances of these two Washington County areas out of your full Beaverton Enterprise Zone area Landing data centers well I I'm not a betting person so I'm not sure I can ask answer that question because I really don't know I think one of those you could probably imagine would not be a you know a good candidate for a date or because it's already fairly fully developed and the other one I think it's it's still fairly small uh to be able to to cite the data center and uh that's that's about as good of a guess as I can make right now we I we would certainly push for your educated guess and yeah and in our in our in mind you know and I I don't have a lot of experience with data centers because we don't have you know but uh the fact that we don't have any probably would lead me to believe that it's not likely that we're going to get um that's I'm not trying to kind of wave around your question but that's that's the good explanations and there's a total aside the Western Avenue Redevelopment is coming along we can get we can finally drive through there which is a major benefit you have something to understand well I just wanted to let the board know that even though we didn't attend the um meeting the signal that the two are here and Mr craigie has been working closely with Beaverton oh absolutely and thank you for the many letters you sent we were properly notified I'm happy to hear that and yes I I was remiss in thanking Matt for his support and uh and we've been in close contact on this and and I've answered a few questions he sends I think Washington County has had their input into the process so thank you for reminding me of that yeah well going for the presumptive close uh Commissioners are you ready for this to come to us May 16th on the consent agenda do you want a thumbs up you bet the only thing I'm a fan of into prisons I think I found missing is Matt and I were talking and he said that you would be favorable to a gain share provision for Washington County oh wow I've learned over the years not to wade into that end of the uh part man survival this is what you say are there any other questions I I was just about to say if there are no other questions any sensible question I mean back to the uh the city council yeah I I do want to take just a moment and say thank you so much for the work here because uh at Beaverton has done a great job in uh focusing on economic development from all angles and I know I've worked to go for a long time and I know you've been really uh dedicated and it's and it shows in the growth and the the way that Beaverton has expanded and Matt also you're still sort of new here and sort of but I really appreciate how how well you know just over two I can't quit I'm here longer than he is but my point is that Let's Open Stage that way I I really appreciate the work that you do with our other Economic Development leaders throughout the county and we we haven't had that in our history here so it's really important and it shows with just having both of you at the table right so it's good work thank you and I really appreciate that and yes again Matt does a great job of convening the local Washington County uh folks and we've we've worked through a lot of naughty things over the naughty hey not okay be careful complex complex two so complex things especially during covet and that was a time when all of us were scrambling and uh he did a great job of stepping in and really kind of keeping all the chickens and cats in the right place yeah it's been a very productive Forum it's been uh great to bring everyone together now monthly good yeah so great thank you uh Board of county commissioner wait wait don't go away first I have a serious question okay okay maybe I misunderstood I was looking at the map and trying to understand your comments and Families is part of this Outside The City of Beaverton and I think it is and if so why isn't it Annex is part of the of doing this is the question just let me repeat the question why is an annexation part of the process of the requirement to take out an Enterprise Zone and you're asking us to participate in at least I and I think others feel that cities are the best provider of urban services why wouldn't this area be within the city of beavers in all of it it's not part of the statute for Enterprise zones it's not it's not a requirement for the entitlements uh so I I don't really know why it just that's not a requirement if you go there once before in relationship to be rich in the Nike campus yeah uh well I wasn't there uh but that's probably why I'm here I got a different pocketbook but I don't understand I I can't really comment commissioner on why that's not part of it it's just it's well related to that but different I think you have two of us who are encouraging that uh but we need to get a upaa drafted and done yes and you're better off to do it with uh current five of us before the end of 24. then not but I would support that so you might want to take that back to the shop I will take that message back because I finally remembered to bring it up thank you you're not saying just for this area you're saying to hold you the whole city yeah in Washington County we need to get back to it now that we're past covet right yeah yes okay pause is over any other questions thank you very much take the rest of the day off Bill don't worry about it Matt go back to work head straight back upstairs I will take that back someone you knows I ain't doing it yeah you don't have that Authority oh and somehow we've made it to the end of our work session agenda which I've already misplaced so if we're not at the end of the agenda you need to set me straight we are at the end I did have one announcement um chair you had brought up earlier um CPO revisioning it is next Tuesday work session we were able to squeeze in a bit earlier um and if the board recalls the meeting that that was moved from the Ada policy was also um needed to be moved out and that is on June 9th do I invite I think six sorry so both items are scheduled for next week's board and commission appointment on the northwest act so we should be done by mid-morning next Tuesday and not have a need for the afternoon so they're both on for next week cool okay uh and stay tuned I hope we'll have more filled in in our rolling agenda set for our June first round table and I just sent uh by the way for your information I haven't been on email all day so why just send a text to Megan asking her to notify CPO one or CBO seven remember we talked about the re-envisioning and it got backboned so we're going to be I want to make sure that that information is getting to them that we're it's scheduled for next week yeah oh but our work session is in the afternoon it's not in the evening I'm just having trouble keeping track all the meetings sorry of course I was having it was obvious I was having trouble with dates too so we're in the same boat anything to do with numbers well and I think that brings us to the end of today's work session darn it now we get to go home and read the it's one yeah no kidding the six budget documents that are on my desk I think they're I think Washington counties is pretty riveting but I'm after talking to chair Smith last night I appreciate our situation uh there's isn't hosted yet but they have all of their budget committee meetings in one wow that'd be from the Pharaohs I don't know how you do that too much information I appreciate that ours are spread out returned bye",

        "text": "good evening welcome to the Salem area mass transit district board of directors meeting today is Thursday July 27 2023 is 5 30 p.m and this meeting is now called to order with the clerk of the board please note for Quorum and I would like to state that director Ramiro Navarro is absent this evening and we have director Sadie Carney attending virtually is okay and our director Duncan is currently absent but we're hoping she will be joining us virtually I will now pass it over to General Manager Pollock to provide our safety moment great thank you so this month I would like to focus my comments on a recently completed safety event the bus rodeo bus rodeo is an annual safety and skills competition for Transit operators who volunteered to participate the bus rodeo also in the bus rodeo involves a pre-trip inspection and a driving test in which a Transit operator navigates an obstacle course the course consists of various obstacles that must be negotiated with the time limit for example the offset where the bus must complete a simulated Lane change the diminishing clearance obstacle which is the audience favorite where the bus maintains a minimum speed of 20 miles per hour while driving through a narrowing path outlined by barrels and the Judgment stop which is the last obstacle in the course where the bus must stop less than six inches from a cone placed on the finish line this year we held our first rodeo since covid and we had over 43 participants including 27 Transit operators five administrative and maintenance Personnel who currently hold a commercial driver's license and 11 administrative Personnel who many for the first time drove a bus last we also had one special participant who we may hear about later who completed a partial run and the winner of this year of this year's competition for the administrative employees was Melissa the administrative employees who maintain a CDL with Seth Hamlin our Mavericks who are people who don't qualify for the national competition either by time or driving record with Peggy store and the Masters Transit operator champion who will represent chariots at the American public transportation association's International Rodeo next May is Gerald Falls and a great time was had by all it was good to see several board members attend even though it was quite hot that day we had a a great day and a great safety training event s thank you thank you general manager so we don't have any changes to the agenda tonight so we'll move right along to item three for our oath of office where our newly elected officers will take the oath of office at the board of directors special meeting on July 13 2023 the board held officer elections at which time new officers were elected and announced at this time will each office each officer will take the oath of office will the officers please step forward in front of the diocese right and we have two online we'll do them next month okay let's raise your right hand right hand I we will state your name aye Ian Davidson Square that I will support the constant Al Constitution and laws of the United States and the laws of the United States and the state of Oregon as vice president for the board of directors the board of Salem area mass transit district for the term ending June 30th 2025 June 30th 2025 or until my successor is fully acquainted and qualified or so my successor is totally appointed and that's what we have and with that I would like to invite our now Vice President but former president Ian Davidson to provide outgoing remarks but before we do we would like to formally recognize your all right so we have two items here with the transition of officers I'd like to take this opportunity to remind community members staff and members of the board oops to please be respectful and refine from disruptors during this meeting all right one second okay Ian thank you for all your service as wanted to present to you this plaque I did want to say one other thing so we've got that plaque that formalizes your service as Ford president but we know that you had a very special title and we wanted to commemorate that as well so for those that don't know um when I was elected were president I had very young children at home so we're trying to explain what a board president was relied on bus Manor and so this is a wonderful shirt thank you very much yes it'll cherish this in the plaque but mostly assured it was uh mainly director Carney's idea and we just wanted to make sure that you always remembered your time as board president and all the many accomplishments that you had which including all the multiple federal grants that we've received for buses and infrastructure you know with our new electric Corridor which we're so excited about the adoption of a strategic plan adoption of the Dei plan implementing weekend and later night service was a very effective leader during the covid pandemic and early development of the South Salem Transit Center um so do we need to take a quick picture because I know for the plaque where do you want us all right so I will now hand it over to you to make your outgoing remarks sure thank you very much president you know as president thanks for the opportunity to share some remarks and some Reflections um early on in my time as board president general manager Alan Paul encourage me to think about what I wanted to accomplish during my short time as board president and he specifically noted that it would go quickly and and so as I considered his question I settled on four things that I'd like to reflect on first I wanted to make it easier for people to serve on the Chariots board despite their life circumstances representative democracy works best when it is truly representative and the board accomplished this in May 2021 when we adopted a stipend policy for all future board members the modest stipend provides a small amount of money to cover some of the costs of Public this is not something that will make anyone Rich far from it but it will for some this will cover the costs of babysitting that they might need to be able to attend a neighborhood association meeting while for others this might cover missed work shifts while they attend to their board and this I think most importantly opens up public service to people who otherwise would be unable to serve people who will and can become great public servants second I wanted to Green our Fleet thereby reducing the pollution we admit in our community in October 2019 we significantly reduced the climate pollution of our compressed natural gas buses when we switch to renewable natural gas and then in 2022 we transitioned to using renewable diesel in our diesel buses this is a far cleaner fuel than fossil diesel so these two changes made it so that we have now the cleanest Transit Fleet in Oregon however in addition as president you know espressi noted over the last four years we have received four separate awards that have funded 20 battery electric buses which is almost one-third of our local Fleet 10 of which right now are sitting at Del Webb's operations headquarters soon we will launch our first electric bus Corridor around Route 11 or longest in busiest route and there is certainly more work to be done here but I am so very immensely proud of what we've accomplished to Greener Fleet we are and will continue to be Oregon's cleanest Transit Fleet I wanted to reduce barriers for Riders we've accomplished this in three significant ways first and most importantly thanks to the first of its kind investment from the state we reinstituted Saturday service and the for the first time ever instituted later evenings on weekdays Sunday and holiday service this change alone has been utterly and completely transformative transformational for our community we also adopted a new Fair policy that standardizes fares among our regional and local systems this launches in just five days in Oregon the urban rural divide is real standardizing fares perhaps is one small contribution to closing that divide and reducing barriers to our Riders who use our regional system finally in September 2002 excuse me September 2022 in partnership with the cities of Salem and Kaiser as well as Salem Kaiser Public Schools we've been able to roll out a year-long trial of free fares for anyone 18 years and in the first month we saw an 89 increase in youth ridership and the ridership has remained High since increased ridership is good but that's really an incomplete picture each one of these rides represent a student being able to attend an after-school program a parent being able to take their child on the bus to run errands or a young person being able to get to their after-school job the trial is proving worthwhile and will soon turn into a permanent policy that benefits Young benefits Youth and families all over our service area and then the fourth uh and final thing I wanted to focus on as board president was continuous internal and external Improvement I wanted to take seriously our job of creating Community connections to do this we created a new strategic plan for chariots with a new Mission Vision and values that guide our work as an agency and it requires rigorous we adopted a long-range Transit plan which was the first of its kind in Charities history this plan sets us up for near medium and long-term successes in our industry-leading customer net promoter score which I'll just note is a whopping 40 points above the industry average is a testament to the efforts we have made in this regard I'm very proud of my time as board president because I was able to represent not only the board but also chariots as an agency to The Chariot staff I say thank you thank you for making it an honor to represent your work the value that you provide to me to my family and the community is remarkable because so much of what you do is behind the scenes or done quietly and professionally I think many in the community do not fully appreciate your whatever their feelings I appreciate you I appreciate your from the maintenance workers who have a more than 99 on-time preventative maintenance performance across all services to the transit operators who get me and many others where we need to go safely and professionally to the customer service staff who help thousands of individuals and to all the many others including the administrative staff executive leadership and two all of these individuals who to modify a popular phrase make the buses run on time thank you four years ago Alan was right when he said that my time as a board president would go by quickly I am incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished together my wife is fond of telling me that though I",

        "text": " projects with a 20-foot buffer from the panel to the fence uh disc is that disc up annually or how do you prepare that the avoid fire in that buffer zone uh that would be with the operation maintenance to maintain the inside of the site to make sure it's clean okay but how do they do that for this particular project that's to be determined just because we are proposing cheap grazing so that would have to be part of that agreement and if there's anything else needed that can't be controlled by a vegetation clearing from that then that's something that would have to be worked out so it's a little bit too early to to say so this has been mentioned earlier but the the enormous amount of elk in that area that migrates through there on a very uh on a basis a regular basis uh maybe monthly or so and this fence is going to detour those animals from going around that project is is that the intent of it is to keep things fenced out of there also get a little bit to the fence so part of the fence is a requirement for National Electric you know structural standards for you because it's an energy facility there are other needs for it to yes keep you know large game out of the internal the project area at this point it's not um it's more about the security it's less about you know big game and those are things that also there's ongoing discussions with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife that uh we'll be engaged in throughout this permitting process to determine um you know like fence design and those kind of things so there's it's too too soon to say um but the project will likely need to have a fence for security reasons and then it's a means of trying to accommodate that the best possible way to make it you know Wildlife friendly not just for big game but for other Critters as well okay well I I'm real familiar with that area I lived there basically my whole life those elk are going to migrate around the north end of that area and they're going to head south and that's going to funnel them right into the freeway and there's nothing to prevent that from happening and you know what's going to happen if I heard they all get going across that freely so okay this is just a terribly proposed idea to begin with I think you're definitely taking your comment into account the little things we'll be looking at when we're evaluating the application hey it's Nancy where's Nancy okay good um going to the phone lines uh and again my apologies uh when I likely mispronounce your name uh James buchel James good evening I may uh lawyer who's representing a local local group that's forming an opposition to the project I'm sorry I couldn't be there tonight but I have covid and I didn't want to infect everybody and I'm still fighting it um the first question I have was on the threshold machine jurisdictions which seems to turn on this high-value Farmland characterization and if I go over the Clackamas County GIS thing and just right click on some of these Parcels I'm not seeing that a majority of the acreage is class 1 or class two so has fsac or somebody done an analysis for jurisdictional purposes to figure out you know why if at all this is this is to be regarded as high value I'm going to go to the applicant to answer that but I would say generally in the Willamette Valley most of the soils are classified as high value Farmland um we have not yet done that on our evaluation ourselves but I'm sure the applicant has so I will let you answer the question here uh yeah on behalf of the applicant again this is Paul Hicks so uh with tetratech we did evaluate the soils and within the farm using uh what is um kind of best practice for soils is the nrcs soils database there is uh mapping throughout the project area uh in Lynn County um and so that data is available online uh class one and two soils are present within the area based on our estimate it's close to about 300 acres of those soils and there'll also be an independent soil assessment of the project area being completed in addition um there's also nrcs soils that are class 3 and class 4 soils which depending on the type of soils are also within the Willamette Valley can be considered high value and so we're looking at those as well so we are taking all that information into account but that data is based on nrcs data and that's what at this point we've used to determine that indeed we anticipate this is a you know under F sex jurisdiction as a project because it will like well exceeds the 160 acre standard um I guess what I would say is if you say that 300 out of the 1500 or 1100 Acres or whatever it is is class one and two the statute seems to require that the tracks be predominantly High values those classes of soils so I'm not I don't think you're meeting the standard and if that's true then you're kicked off into a different jurisdictional path that I think puts you back in the county but we'll get to that in our in our written comments and um so the next question is for the caller I do understand the tract um scenario and that is taken into account in a full and robust analysis of soils uh will be presented in the land use component under what in in you know the fsec terms is called exhibit K but it will both evaluate the soils at the track level um and uh in addition to those within the site boundary system is working or not but if I right click on the parcels I can get a parcel by parcel uh determination of how many acres is each type of soil off of the gis system and you can add them up pretty quick and see what's going on and because it's a jurisdictional significance it seems to not have been done so much sooner than the process um so that's that we'll get we'll get to that now if in fact it's not predominantly class one in class two and if the class 3 and class fours aren't the types that happen to be mentioned in the statute which I think you can also find out is the case then the next question is you know how much how much of the property is actually going to be used by the facilities and we heard a number earlier tonight of about 1100 acres is that is that a is that essentially going to be the footprint within the 1500 and 88 acre facility uh this is Brian Tran the applicant um from our desktop analysis that seems like it would be the 1100 Acres but the actual footprint on the project um is to be turbine to be determined at this time just because we need to finish up all of our Environmental Studies um we'll basically use all that data and then we we basically form something called a constraints map and then we use that to lay out the actual footprint of the project when when will more of this detail be available because again these questions of the size and the soils are jurisdictional and in some sense we shouldn't even be here if if it's not the high value farmland or if it's not the right size and it's a win will we know about the footprint more precisely the footprint will be provided in the application for site certificate um and I think maybe we can talk also with Odo staff and see what other information we can make available will the application also provide details on a particular solar cell technology to be used uh there will be so the application will provide a robust description of the the project that details everything from the um that are included that are evaluated at the time of Permitting um it's typical in when I work with other projects they might request flexibility if there's other types of designs that might be more efficient or effective that come available later in Market but we will have a specific set of of standards and and typical um cheats that are reflected in the application that we described for both the panels tracking systems you know the types of posts um everything down to the ground collector wires potential access to the site there's a great deal of detail that will be provided for anything that has a permanent or temporary impact from during construction or development of the project will be addressed and recorded in the application for site certificate and available for review for um for for all to to take into account in this process I was going down that road because somebody mentioned a few minutes ago that there wouldn't be any chemicals to Leach off of these solar cells and there's been a number of studies in the general waste management and they all swear that says that that rain water will Leach things like lead and chromium off of these solar cells and so there's nothing particularly different about about your fuse cell technology than other polycrystalline cells is there it has the same it has the same chemicals in it as the other ones uh Q cells panels and again I'm not part of our manufacturing for the module side of it but um I mean this is something again we can I could go ahead and go back to my team to see what is the com what is actual the components and minerals use um to form our panels and that's something that we could post on our website to have it public okay and in in terms of specifying things do you think you will pick the Battery Technology by then and the and the size of the battery plant by the time you get the application done a little bit hard to say um if I understand the fsec process correctly there should be a micro siding part of this feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but uh the battery itself especially nowadays it's very volatile to choose one in the sense that you know things the technology is always uh changing very rapidly so if we're looking at a project that's helping to start construction in the latter half of 2025 and come online at the end of 2026 to lock in the specific type of panel and technology in in 2023 is pretty far out so we would like to request some flexibility when it comes to specific modules and specific battery type until we're a little bit closer to construction and when we can actually secure all the equipment needed so you wouldn't actually be locking yourself into using the panels from the Georgia plant that's pretty much our biggest Advantage so we would most likely be going with Q cells technology when it comes to panels and this is Todd corner from the Oregon Department of energy I'll respond to",

        "text": " that is okay if that's what you want to the one place that i will try to kind of keep things um consistent is to make sure that we're not veering into something that is not already included in the evidentiary record because that is important that we you know acknowledge that that's been and uh and that we need to stick to that tesla condon um council member condon here um i am just a bit confused by the contested case on page 268 and this is the first time i've read through a contested case so um in mr white's testimony he's concerned about strike on a hill and i heard no mention of water on page 268 discussing structural standard five on b i don't know if we want to call it up to construction the certificate holder will consult with landowners regarding right-of-way acquisition it's rather long but it speaks to water and i'm just questioning is is this a water is mr white concerned about water or stability of the hill and secondly for idaho power mr white said pretty clearly and i don't see it anywhere that anybody's asking for a full structural stability study on the ground for the whole but just this one piece this the hills over the grant and i'd just like you to clarify for me talking about the whole project versus this piece of it to satisfy maybe some of the concerns uh prior to site certificate being yeah or i don't know what order you give some clarification jesse on how to proceed yeah and again this is um going to be at the council's discretion how you want to handle this i um think that you know the to keep things as fair and as clear as possible um you know if if a council member has a question um we should you know you should direct that to whoever it is that you want to hear from provide the other party an opportunity to say something about it as well um and you know in this particular instance i heard you ask a question that sounded like it was directed to mr white um and um and so you know i think again to be fair it would make sense to have him answer that and then to see if idaho power has anything else that they want to say about that and again i don't want to sound like a broken record on this but we we really really need to keep things confined to what is on the record i don't think we've strayed from that at all but um it's it's just something i want everybody to keep in mind okay it sounds then like giving the opportunity to mr white to come up and answer the question that counselor anden has asked with no new information being presented okay um the question i think i heard was was this about water on the slope and it's really about in the there are maps and descriptions of the area around legrand and the area is described as unstable in the form of unconsolidated landslide debris and everyone who lives in the area knows what that's about you know the driveways are cracking and basically pulling apart it's a it's a very um unstable area so people are concerned about that and also the the blasting plan mentioned earlier never specifies where blasting's going to occur so we just don't know they might decide to blast they might is there anything else thank you just to confirm it really it was not specific to water it's stability for the hill and there's no request that i have heard or read about of you or anyone else saying there needs to be a an analysis of the whole correct yeah no one transmitted i've it's been saying that right thank you okay does idaho power wish to just very briefly um i i've been able to confirm and this is in the record that the geotech plan does is uh there is a plan to specifically address and do detailed geotechnical studies of the area that mr white is concerned about that is something that will be done once we know where the route is going to do those types of studies are not particularly effective until you you have the final design and routing one other point i would ask the council to consider is that it certainly isn't in idaho power's interest to place a tower in an unstable area um not only are we you know are we required by law to avoid those types of risks but it would be you know it would be something that for that idaho power regardless of the law would avoid and we hope that that gives the council some comfort about our intentions of doing very serious geotechnical work particularly in areas of concern prior to any construction thank you okay so council are there any suggestions um or recommended changes to the conditions under this structural standard number five in the proposed order no is this in the sdks order this is in the contested case order sorry that's right let's remember condon again um mr ratcliffe on page 268 sorry is that a condition a required condition in the contested case order on page 268 is contested case issue ss3 for which there were no exceptions filed which was more specific to blasting and potential impacts water quality no we're talking about ss5 no i know it's related to mr whites so front party we have an amended recommended soil condition number four and that includes the highlighted information that you're pointing to um and so that is and uh a recommendation from the hearing officer to include that language so as the proposed contested case order is written if adopted that would include this bolded language but not related to structural standard five i misread read that then it yeah it's not it wasn't this language didn't arise from structural standard issue five but it is a piece of the proposed contested case and so should you adopt the proposed contested case order without modifying this piece then that bold language will go in so since we're in in this kind of narrowing down of issues we have a number of of issues on which no exceptions were filed where the hearing officer may have made changes from the agency's proposed order to address some of the concerns that were raised by the person who who requested that contested case issue um and you know i i don't have the specifics of this you know or know the reason why this person didn't file an um but it's entirely possible that you know that that revision um met the concerns of the the person involved my my error i think okay then back to structural standard five there's a lot of weaving going on here between different structural standards but sounds like that one was taken care of and under structural standard three let's go back to structural standard five are there any comments or recommendations for changes to conditions under the proposed contested case order related to structural standard five seems hearing none maybe we got through that one and now we need to go back to the proposed order no we did not there was no there was no straw poll right so we stopped the straw poll and then you went into deliberation so we need to go back to the straw poll on the proposed contested case order before we go back to the proposed order so in doing the straw polls we want you pull us yes okay so unless there's any other changes i can read that one both include language that yes okay that patrick suggested okay so as i have it articulated council will agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue s5 with the following modifications to make the changes to reflect that the proposed contested case order i'm sorry that's duplication that significant reconnaissance desktop survey was conducted okay so haley jenkins perry choctoote ken howe yes ann beyer jordan truitt yes cindy condon yes thank you and then now back to the proposed order yes counselor buyer conferred with our counsel i had a question on the blasting component of this condition which requires notice but notice through a newspaper newspapers aren't always the best source of information these days and i'm wondering if it is impractical to ask that the applicant notify property owners a given distance of a blasting activity i know that's something we regularly did at the local just to make sure that property owners were aware that something was going to happen i think the other conditions are appropriate um in terms of of notice but but i think then the newspaper notice alone is is probably not the best vehicle so thank you how's the council feel about that suggestion on notice um thank you for the question councilmember jenkins i'm trying to remember what we did at the local level and i don't know if it's 500 feet from the impact area or a half mile i i am the wrong person to ask about distance but thinking about the impact of blasting and just letting people know that it's going to happen um i i just can't remember from our local code what we required but somebody with practical experience could help inform this thank you this is patrick wrote the department of justice can i just seek clarification on are you referencing counselor buyer to the um amended recommended soil protection condition for in the proposed contested case order okay i see it no thank you um council member buyer i i know the intent is to give very clear and objective standards so i think notice um notice to property owners of record within a certain distance would be since we don't know what that distance is right now is that something staff can come back to us with tomorrow when we come back to this i hate doing that but for the the applicant's construction contractor to do a mailed notice to some to property owners within blasting of some unknown give more direction within a certain timeframe frame at least a week in advance or something and i can look at our county code language tonight to see if i can find something specific i don't mean to be so onerous but when you give notice it's good to get the notice to the people who are affected so first of all i think we need to find out where's the council on this as yeah well let me ask ann uh this is hanley um so this would be in addition to the the one week notice in the newspaper or in replacement of i i don't feel strongly either way but but i think it's critical target the notice not i i hate to say this in public but not many people read public notices in um i i'm just going to offer um because this would be the applicant or its construction contractor and i guess and we're just so programmed that when you say notice i get a procedural trigger in my head and it means a certain thing so i don't",

think um just want to make sure that it continues to serve as as a um guiding uh proposal for for future funding opportunities thank you again Colin for presenting on this and um I will go ahead and work with staff to draft a letter and um Nora if you'd like to uh review that uh and help with that I'd love to have you um join join me in in drafting a letter so would be great I also wanted to recognize that um commissioner palowski uh is with us um Senator demro joined us uh Senator Jax EXC EXC me Senator Jackson now that's a that's a nice addition commissioner Jackson um I think I believe has joined us and if there other Commissioners who joined us a little late after we did the roll call feel free hey great well thank you um and representative Marsh we're so honored uh to have you join us today um and talk to us a little bit about the um work that you uh co-led with Senator Liber uh focusing in on uh the resilient and efficient building sector uh task force uh that that you both uh co-led and then kind of any thoughts you want to share on legislation that's come out of that and um any priorities you see uh for the session thank you am I can you all hear me now we we can yeah okay um I don't have a PowerPoint so oh but somebody else has a PowerPoint that's great think okay well that that there's the headline this is really about the building sector and climate action um as we've put it together in the legislature I want to First acknowledge the expertise that's in this virtual room just seeing all of you looking at your name seeing my colleagues um this is really a center of of power and action on climate issues and I want to also invite you because I see people who were involved in this building discussion to interrupt to augment to correct me as we go along um it was very much a CommunityWide effort um and it also is an effort that started now two years ago and I want to say in the lifetime of legislative um initiatives the tsunami of legislative directives two years ago um is a very long time ago so I went back and reviewed material um and I'm hoping that others uh who are on the call will remember things that I can't remember anymore so with that I thought I would just give you an overview of what that work was and we'll summarize the initiatives that came out of it and that were passed into law first of all I want to just take you back to the year um which was a year before we started this work that was a session where uh which that we came into with um a real Rocky climate history we'd had two sessions 2019 and 20 and 2020 where we had tried to pass um cap invest programs um those programs were not met with enthusiasm by many of our colleagues there were walkouts um there was the end of session um and we set Kapp trade aside so we came into 2021 really trying to figure out where our climate victories could be unfortunately for us there was a group that had come together in the interim um to put together the clean energy opportunity agenda um and we were able to move that during the 2021 session that agenda really included three initiatives um one was House Bill 2021 which was our 100% clean electricity bill the second was House 2475 which allowed the state to implement differential rates in for utility payers recognizing that people who are lower income in a time of wildfire which we'd experienced in 2020 in a time of increasing pressure from climate change on colder days and hotter days in the summer were really uh continually stretching to pay their energy bills so we passed um House Bill 247 75 to allow the utilities to uh in a in a very objective way to support lowincome rate payers with um appropriate rates and we passed House Bill 2842 which is known as our healthy homes program Tim Miller if he's still on this call saw the very um beginning of that effort several years before we passed it when we realized that we needed to start being able to put some money into maintaining the homes that are on the ground right now so that we can fix make critical repairs and then ready them for Energy Efficiency efforts so that that was the primary work in in house in 2021 but there was also another effort that came along that wasn't quite as successful and that was a proposal to allow local governments to implement their own reach code so reach codes as probably everybody on this call notes are um in the building codes um uh around Energy Efficiency and what we proposed was to local governments go beyond the state code in a in a fairly simplified way um to impose stronger standards for Energy Efficiency in their buildings um that you know some people thought that bill would slide through um as it turned out it was pretty controversial we had a number of different entities standing up and raising questions with reach code so we set that aside but we still knew that one of our next big initiatives really needed to be to take on the building sector we know that buildings um comprise about 35% of the greenhouse gas emissions that are generated um so there's a tremendous opportunity to um look at buildings both existing and buildings that may be here in the future and to find Energy Efficiency efforts and um materials efforts that would help people live in healthier more supportive um structures and go to work in healthier and more supportive structur um and that would save them money on the long term especially in a time of of changing climate we knew as we took on this looked at this building's effort that Energy Efficiency is really one of our lwh hanging fruits in the in the energy world and as we're looking at 100% clean electricity we're trying to figure out how we're going to solve transmission problems and how we're going to go after sighting issues um and and how we are going to build more facilities and sometimes um some of us forget that while those are really sexy attractive um attention getting efforts that Energy Efficiency is actually um if you look regionally at the Northwest Energy Efficiency is our biggest bang for the book um next to hydro um over the last 20 years we have saved an incredible uh consumers have saved an incredible amount of money and we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions simply by implementing Energy Efficiency efforts so we knew that we wanted to look at buildings and we wanted to look at them with a very strong focus on Energy Efficiency and making sure that we are we're doing everything possible that we can to make sure that that we are building buildings in the in the way that makes most sense in in a time when we understand that climate change is Among Us so since we we couldn't forward the reach code but we came back in the next short session um that was 2022 two years ago almost exactly now when we started our first meeting and we passed um Senate Bill 15 18 and what Senate Bill 1518 did was to put us on uh a pathway to really looking at the building sector it established the resilient efficient buildings task force and it directed the task force and I'm going to read the mission statement here to identify and evaluate policies related to building codes and building decarbonization for new and existing buildings that would enable the state to meet the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals that are in statute while maximizing additional benefits um the bill 1518 required us to put together a 27 member task force to do this work um and it gave us a little bit of money for us to be able to use to invest in Consultants who could help us actually analyze some of the proposals that came forward so we had a uh the the task force was chaired by Senator Kate Liber who was at that time chair of the energy and environment committee on the Senate and myself I was serving as chair of energy and environment in the house and we had two very able assistant co-chairs Senator Finley representative Owens both of whom are from Eastern Oregon so it was and since I'm from Southern Oregon Senator Liber is from Portland we had a good geographical mix among all of us and we also had a task force that was full of expertise I I pulled the list of members today just to reflect back and it's pretty impressive we had in addition to legislators we had people representing environmental organizations representing climate organizations representing Builders um nonprofit Builders the EJ Community uh local government um the universities and on and on and on um Northwest Natural and pg&amp; uh representing the industries um that could potentially be affected by this work um so it turned out to be a very diverse group um we held 16 online meetings with 2 7 members who were very active and and good excellent participants in the work and we worked over the course of time from April two years ago um until December of that time and what we did was sort of we started with really a process that had four different links in it um first we wanted to Simply build foundational understanding we brought in experts to talk about buildings so that we could all start to understand what the issues were there and what the opportunities might be um we shared policy ideas we had opportunities for everybody in the group to throw out their ideas and we amassed um a big list um which we later needed to call and decide what we were going to focus in on um we that was the process the third um effort which was really to understand and prioritize policy so we went through the master list and we identified things where we thought we had at least a majority of members we were really working pretty carefully In This Very diverse group to make sure that we had not full agreement on everything that wasn't um probably within the realm of possibility but that certainly we had a consensus or let's say at least a majority um view for moving things forward and then the fourth um element of the process was really to model to analyze um all the proposals that had come forward and to measure support we had Consultants on board who would help us understand what the greenhouse gas emission impacts might be of any of the proposals that came forward because we were really trying to ground this work in science and recognizing that multiple benefits",

        "text": ", as they basically are trying to define the difference between the roles and who's responsible at the state level. How does that work? What legislation would actually be, you know, we would be looking for, and then anything that's on the federal, referring that to our federal committee from FAC and putting those in the proper category. So. But everything else went good, and we need your support in November. Any other comments or questions? Okay, thank you, Matt. Thank you, government. All right, note ten notation for action column eleven 1 second motion by Commissioner Zalak, seconded by Commissioner Bryant. Comments on that. All in favor say aye. Aye. Those like sign that motion passes unanimously. All right, Mister Weisberg? Yes, sir. If you want to come on up, we're at general public comment. Sorry for the confusion, sir. My name is Philip Weisberg. I live at 508 clear Lear Road in Ocala shores. I do not live in a homeowners association. Some years ago, my backyard backed up to another backyard that had some, what I would describe as junkyard dogs. And to protect myself from them, from my cats that I have, I put up a fence. Okay. By comparison, can I just give you a copy, everyone, a copy of this? And you will see from the fence company email that I got no mention was made of having to get a permit to put a fence on my own property. And it turns out that they sent a fine to Hercules Fensk on Mary Camp Road, Ryan ball. They find him and then they find me, too. Okay. By comparison, I was an observer in criminal court early last week, and I witnessed a man who was arrested for having 100 grams of heroin told by the judge, okay, you can go. Just pay $50 for the public defender today. Heroin. Another guy had. Case dismissed. Basically, it's Judge Brigham. Another guy was arrested for driving and he got picked up for having methamphetamine. He was told, pay $50 to the public defender, you can go. Okay. But I have a fence to protect myself, my family of cats, and I get fined $1,000. Commonly, I looked it up. If you get arrested for driving under the influence, which can kill people, it's a dollar 500 fine. So after I was in this courtroom, just as an observer, a judge Brigham's courtroom, I walked over to the county. There's another building just to the left of it where the county assessor, I guess, you could call it because I'm a 77 year old diabetic, I'm not going to live that much longer. And I wanted to leave my home and my car to the sisters affiliated with. With my catholic church, Holy Trinity. They are from Uganda. They need living space. And found that this was on there, which is going to cloud the title for me to be able to pass it when I die. And I think this is totally out of proportion to what the issue is. A man puts up a fence on his property, the county doesn't. And this guy ultimately got evicted from his property. That backed up into mine. He reported me prior to him being evicted for not paying rent. And I just, you know, I saw person after person in this judge brigham's court just put, all right, you understand that when you're pleading guilty, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, I'm going to let you go and pay $50 to the public defender. I mean, this guy made it. I was there 3 hours. He made a terrific case for mandatory minimums for crimes because he was letting everybody. Nobody was going to jail. There were people who couldn't make bail after they got arrested and they were time served. That's all right. I just think this is nuts. I want to leave my home, my car and everything in it to the sisters from Uganda. They wanted to be here today, but they had to go to some meeting in Orlando with the bishop, but they were going to be here today. I just want to leave my property to someone who will take care of it, who needs it as part of my relationship with my church and father Pat, who will ultimately get it, and then he will, because they take a vow of poverty, it will be basically in his name, but they'll live in there. And so I'm asking you to waive that thousand dollar fine for having a fence on my own property. Okay. Any question? So who fined you? I don't see the fine here. Well, who signed what fine? I'm not sure on the building permit how you got a $1000 fine. I think the penalties are usually like a double permit fee. Let me see if I can. Okay. So, Tracy, do you know commissioners between Chuck and Mike Savage, they might be able to explain where this went to code enforcement board proceedings and that it's. That's okay with the chair, that it would be something that he would need to file a request to go in front of the code enforcement board to speak to them to reduce the fine that would then come to you all. I went there and they gave me. I can't believe how many pages there are? This must be 50 pages for this nonsense. And here it is right here. Well, you need to keep that. So I would ask you to waive that so I can give clear title to the sisters and father Pat from Holy Trinity Church when I die. Mike good morning, commissioners. Mike Savage, building safety director a little background on this case. In May of 2019, the building safety license and permit investigator Jackie Reyes actually sent a notice to Mister Weisberg that he had a fence installed without the required county permit. The fence exceeds 6ft. So under the Florida building code, he was required to get a building permit for that. As we know, the property owner is responsible to ensure all permits are pulled on their property. Which is why Mister Weisberg was exactly engaged in that. Mister Weisberg responded in writing, disputing that he didn't need a permit for defense and indicated he hired a professional offense company. Well, professional offense company does not have a license as a contractor in the state of Florida, so that falls back to the homeowner. A total of five notices were sent to Mister Weisberg before the case was actually referred to the code enforcement board. He did not go straight to a code enforcement board. Just under one notice. The investigators tried to take it to the 9th degree in order to be empathetic with a citizen's case. He actually got five notices. On February 25, 2021, James Roger, who was another licensing investigator who took over the case when Miss Reyes left hand, delivered a copy of the notice to appear to the code Enforcement board to Mister Weisberg, notifying him that in March of 2021, the board was going to hear his case. On March 10, 2021, the case was presented to the code Enforcement Board and Mister Weisberg was not present at that case. The code Enforcement board directed Mister Weisberg to clear the violation. In other words, get his building permit issued, or he could be fined $50 a day up to $3,000. That's the standard that the code enforcement board is allowed to do. Whether it's a building code case, whether it's a growth management case or a growth services case, it's still a dollar 50 a day fine. On April 9, I'm sorry. March 26, 2021, James Rogers, the licensing investigator, hand delivered a copy of that notification to Mister Weisberg that this was going to be the case. He was going to get fined if he didn't get the permit issued. On April 9, code enforcement received an email about his Social Security Administration, outlined about his current benefits that he has and requesting the fees to be waived at that time to code enforcement. April 14, 2021, code enforcement Board imposed the violations as they said they would due to inactivity of getting that permit issued. Mister Weisberg mails a check to code enforcement, or, I'm sorry, to building investigator James Rogers, for the payment of the building permit that was attempting to be pulled. Unfortunately, we're out cash handling procedures. We cannot accept that he is required to come in and pay that fee himself, not send that to an investigator. It's an audit issue. We have to make sure cash handling procedures are done properly. The lien was recorded on June 11, 2021. I noticed that in a previous email that had come around, and I can't speak to this, but I will speak to the email that Mister Weisberg told staff he did not resubmit for the building permit because he still did not believe that he needed any permit from the building department and that the building department should have taken his payment. So he was notified we couldn't accept the payment the way he sent it. He actually sent it personally to one of the investigators. He was told, you can't do that. You have to come in and actually pay it. You have an online ability to pay. So he could have paid online, but then he was then sent a notice that you can't do that. You need to actually pay. And it was made out to the wrong department. It wasn't even made out to the building safety department or to the board of county commissioners. I don't know if any follow up. When was the fine established? The first fine. So in order for it to get up to $3,044.38 is what I'm being told the fine was, that would have been dollar 50 a day. So that's started",

        "text": " that we can price parking because we don't have a program and a mechanism already set up to do that we're recommending just removing minimum parking so to our knowledge most jurisdictions in the state are pursuing that path um but that's not to say that this is the end of these rules and that future requirements won't come down requiring some kind of pricing programs if it did happen though you were asking about residential areas or lower density areas I would expect parking pricing to occur more in commercial and Town Center type areas um generally because that's typically where we see it but I don't know that for sure so as far as these rules are written we would probably be most likely just to remove the minimum parking and not do a pricing program okay thank you any more for Mr Kelly all right all right thank you very much I appreciate your time this evening yeah thank you very much we are at almost 7 30 normally we take a break at about 90 and so I'm wondering if we should have a little break now and then plan to go without interruption for the um public hearing do you have a thought about that Mr bevette really your discretion uh Madam chair in terms of how you want to proceed um up to you all right well I'm thinking we'll go ahead and take a break later if it seems we need one but um do any Commissioners have any preference on that all right and let's let's go ahead so the next item is a planned Amendment um Brian Robb will give the presentation go ahead Brian I'm not seeing the presentation brought up yet there we go um I don't mean to interrupt but would you like me to start this off or is there going to be a slide in here that cues me oh sorry yes yeah I thought we were going to start with County Council but is that correct indeed yes yes so if we could actually uh earn that screen off thanks as we all talked uh last time and I think our two brand new Commissioners were actually in the audience at the time this is a quasi-judicial hearing um it's not all that common for quasi-judicial hearings to come before the Planning Commission but I'm more than happy to take questions during this as I mentioned to the Planning Commission last month think of yourselves more as a jury hearing a case in this type of of matter rather than as legislators enacting an ordinance and if you think about that all of this will kind of make sense but I'm going to start out because there are different processes required for quasi-judicial hearings there is are more due process Protections in summary and so I'm going to begin with a script that will describe the quasi-judicial process required under our Planning Commission rules and then we'll go from so a lot of this is going to seem canned and it kind of is it's right out of our rules but I'm going to go ahead and do the introduction before we get to Brian's staff report nice hearing before the Planning Commission is for a plan amendment to change the land use designation of a 0.97 acre lot that contains an existing home from neighborhood commercial District also known as NC the residential nine units per acre commonly known as R9 consistent with the designation of bordering lands to the south and east the hearing will be conducted in the following manner first staff will present a summary of the applicable criteria and the staff report including a recommendation the Planning Commission can ask any clarifying questions it Wishes the chair will then open the public hearing second the applicant May provide information by way of testimony a presentation or both there is a 10 minute limit on that part of the hearing next testimony will be taken from persons in favor of the proposal there is a five minute time limit per person a 10 minutes for a CPO next testimony will be taken from persons in opposition to the proposal there's a five-minute limit per person 10 minutes per CPO if there are any persons that wish to testify and who are neutral on the proposal that testimony will be taken next with the same time limits finally the applicant will have an opportunity to offer rebuttal information or testimony if the applicant so desires there is a five minute time limit on this final part of the hearing anyone who wishes to testify on this planned Amendment and is not notified staff in advance we'll need to raise their virtual hand when staff asks who will testify in favor who will testify in opposition and it will testify as neutral so just make sure you raise your hand at the appropriate time so you can get called on once each person is given their opportunity to speak they should State their name and address after which I will ask them to take an oath or affirmation as to the truthfulness of their testimony afterwards the person can begin their persons may also submit written testimony to the clerk for the Planning Commission it can be emailed to Lut Planning Commission at Washington County or dot gov the deadline to submit written testimony on this plan Amendment is the close of the public hearing unless the Planning Commission agrees to establish a later prior to the end of the public hearing tonight a participant in this hearing May request a continuance to submit additional testimony evidence or and requests that the record remain open for at least seven days prior to the close of this hearing chair Lockwood will ask clerk Aguilar if any additional written testimony has been after the close of the public hearing the Planning Commission May deliberate and vote on this planned Amendment request no additional testimony will be received after the public is hearing hearing is closed except as I just described a few minutes all testimony arguments and evidence should be directed toward the criteria described by staff during the opening report that you'll hear from Brian Robb here in a moment or other criteria in the plan or land use regulations what's the person providing testimony believes to apply to the decision on this planned Amendment failure to raise and issue accompanied by statements or evidence sufficient to afford the Planning Commission and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issue May preclude the ability to make an appeal based on that issue further failure of the applicant to raise any constitutional or other issues related to the proposed conditions of approval with sufficient specificity to allow Washington County to respond to the issue May preclude their ability to file a lawsuit for any at this time each planning commissioner should disclose any ex parte contacts bias or conflicts of interest those are the three areas that are required to be disclosed for a quasi-judicial hearing that I mentioned last month I'm more than happy to describe in detail what those amount to but in short and exporting contact means you've heard from one of the parties outside of this hearing and so you need to put it on the record to disclose that you've heard from one of the parties because in the interests of fairness everybody needs to know who's heard what bias means you actually know one of the parties one of the particularly affected property owners and you have some bias either in favor or against them and conflicts of interest mean that you have some Financial or pecuniary interest here that a decision in this matter might affect you or your family financially either positively or avoidance of financial detriment so those are my very brief summations of X party contacts bias and conflicts of interest so I would at this time call on any planning commissioner present for this hearing to disclose any exported contacts bias or conflicts of interest that you might have and I'm also happy to further describe those if you're not uh looks like we have commissioner yeah so I just want to disclose the potential conflict um I don't have a direct conflict on this but as a developer and as a resident of the area I lived uh I walked past this property and lived right around this property for many many years and as a developer I have briefly evaluated this property in the past um and we've we've looked at it as the kind of this the same thing that we're looking at right now is that the possibility that this could be changed to an R9 Zone and we've stayed away from the neighborhood commercial as a company and we don't have any current interest in it um I don't I don't know the current applicant or any of those things but there is some potential conflict um and then if the property did come for sale my company could look at it again in the future but there's no direct conflict or known Conflict at this point just want to disclose that great uh thank you commissioner fry that was a perfect actually that's an example of a potential conflict of interest where there's no guarantee of any Financial benefit or avoidance of financial detriment but it's a possibility the difference between an actual and a potential conflict of interest is a potential conflict of interest requires disclosure just as commissioner fry did an actual conflict of interest requires not only disclosure but in most cases that you essentially remove yourself from the deliberation and decision-making process so are there any other um uh disclosures of ex parte contacts bias or conflicts of interest that any other Commissioners would wish to disclose before we begin this hearing and I'm not seeing any others chair Lockwood so I'll turn it back over to you and I think we're now ready for um Brian Robb's staff report yeah thank you Mr bevette uh may we have this staff uh report please Mr Rob thanks Rob can everybody hear me okay yes okay thanks well good evening chair Lockwood and Commissioners I'm Brian Robb associate planner in the community Planning Group here at Washington County I'll be giving a presentation for tonight's hearing but we've got a lot of ground to cover so I'll try to be as quick as possible but please ask questions if you have them further details on the various findings of course can be found in the staff report that was attached to tonight's agenda next slide please in terms of the order of the presentation first I'll go over the proposal itself and provide some additional background information on the site the vicinity and the land use history of the property and following the background I'll provide an overview of the key findings and criteria that were addressed in Greater detail in that staff report followed by the staff recommendation next slide please Community planning received a request from icon architecture and planning representing McDaniel Village LLC to change the land use designation of one tax slot of just under one acre in size in the Bonnie slope the Bluffs sub-area of the Cedar Hills Cedar Mill community plan area from neighborhood commercial to residential nine units per acre or R9 the purpose of the neighborhood commercial district is to allow for small",

        "text": "dc's I mean we're real interested in sdc's because it pays for things but the reality the reality is that's one of the number one discussion points with us with with developers how do you get credits on your DCS and and you know that kind of thing and and if that can be an incentive a financial incentive that could you don't know but that could be a factor that they were willing to consider depends on the depends on the strength of the of the leasing market right now the leasing Market is not good it's slowed down a lot and so they're just trying to fill space because they're they got their expenses um and and but this that could be a factor that could really at least help push that along oh I'm just wondering I mean I like the idea ofc on one hand on the other hand we rely on those secs right for for the city I wonder if some analysis could be done that okay if we're given X Inc is because we know we're going to get Y in this you know property taxes or whatever benefit that particular industry would bring to the city to make sure we're not you know no that might be a little because you don't get the property tax till year a later yeah but I mean in the future what it would be so what are we giving up to gain what right yeah theoretically with the advanced manufacturing and and those family wage jobs Rene mentioned you're going to have more infrastructure in that building whether it's gigantic CNC machines or whatever that's going to drive property that's the key is really to get I was at a at a Aerospace Semiconductor Company yesterday on the C with the CTE program this was in another city and the kinds of machines that they had is obviously the kind of thing that's going to produce a lot of revenue for for a city plus you have to have very talented Workforce technical Workforce that can understand how to work those machines and and so to me that's the ideal kind of manufacturing we should try to attract here the other thing and this may not be possible but Wilsonville has that they were doing that program for years where they set up these little Ed zones on a lot by lot basis um and it' be really interested in learn what they're doing over there and how how that's work somebody who worked over I I think the early version didn't work too well and they revised it and I haven't heard the results of that but that's where they used um that's where they used Tax increment financing and a apparently it I guess it didn't count against their 25% Geo you know geographical um um limit in terms of how much of the city could go into into a UR but I I don't think we know that that's going to require more research yeah yeah um yeah um the Sherwood 240 comprehensive plan under the healthy and ecosystems 4.1 one uh states that provide incentives and flexibility to the development Community for the preservation of resources that are above and beyond code requirements um I would like to consider having that as part of this relook as well as far as environmental incentives for the sites that really have to cut all those trees down exactly convenience or yeah agree because like we like Sherwood because of the natural resources and especially in Sherwood West where it's all natural resources essentially like way to incentivize the developers to preserve some of that or incorporate that into the design standards know to that point now there's been a public meeting so we can talk about it but you know we suspect Costco is going to do an application it would be great if they they would uh preserve all those trees along the road for instance sure you know as part of that process Bry looks surprised they had a they had a neighborhood meeting so talk about it's coming up I've been very careful not to use that word but I I know it's now it's in the public clearly um you know just at a very basic level I like all these ideas I think um they're all good and we can explore all of them I want to be a little mindful about the the the scope and this is exactly why we're having this conversation right so we're talking about Ur this Council goal and I'm totally open to expanding the scope and I think if that's what's needed to to meet what our goals are Let's Do It um the the development code is is a pretty narrow you know development code is pretty narrow what are the allowed uses what are the process for getting a land use approval um but if we need to expand that and potentially include this work with some of the other Council goals around atdev or a you know a relook to the UR that we can do that well well my take is if we have two goals that are looking code and we can handle that as one projects that seems like it's more efficient Bruce and I can look at the council goals holistically and see if we can marry some of these to maybe bring into a bigger project um can I make you said something just make sure my suggestion about doing Ur or doing SDC offsets that would have the UR replace those funds not that's how it's commonly and I feel like you could marry it with Dan's suggestion is you know there can be SDC offsets for hey you keep 90% of the trees will you know will knock your sdc's down by x amount you know what I mean to incentivize them hey look at your designs and see if you can incorporate some of these things to hang on to the to hang on to the trees it'll you'll make money we'll get AR trees there be some re have that anyway since that's in our comprehensive um yeah I mean that the Planning Commission does well clear clear an objective standards no that's only for housing so yeah I mean the Planning Commission would actually have discretion on tree protection I agree with you there there hasn't been so far a lot of Street protection in the T employment area um TS corporate had a wetland on their property and so there's much more incentive and regulation over the Wetland that's why you get that coming down to TS TS Road um so we talk about clear and objective standards wouldn't apply to right right well but on top of that if you have an incentive program we would get much more kind of say right we you don't have to have a clear and objective standard for an yeah yeah absolutely so you know maybe one of the areas where it could fit maybe it's not the development code maybe it's some other code but the sdc's in a sense are in some code right so maybe maybe whatever code that they're in you do include the incentives as part of as part of that code provision I mean I don't know if that's the correct way to do it but do the incentives need to be in the code or can they be a program ad that was what I was getting at is the development code narrow I mean you sure you could reference in and it could probably could be in the development code but I don't know that it has to be iser or something upd our code then exactly yeah I like that better I think you know process we could probably do FastTrack you know land use review that probably should be in the development code is that's you need that to sort of defend your decisions your hearing process and decisions um but kind of at a basic at a very basic level you know we we can and should look at what are our allowed uses conditional uses prohibited uses in the commercial land use Zone industrial zones um I'm going to throw a word out here and I think I don't have time to get into it but it's something that Bruce and I have talked about and we want this decision to be made by city council and not by staff or Planning Commission uh we get requests and inquiries on data centers and this is a policy decision that we want you guys to make um because there's a between they don't produce jobs we know that and they don't produce traffic what they the reason cities want them particularly in Oregon is is because there's a revenue stream that comes to the city so that's a decision it's not for us to make obviously we get a lot of R for a revenue stream because there's tremendous amount of equipment in those buildings and so cities go after that just like in California they go after car dealerships because it's a revenue stream or they go after Costco because it's a revenue stream they're building a lot of them in Central Oregon it's because it's because they require a lot HB to keep that equipment cool so to put it on bring the only other thing I would say like I might be open to it if we had a tech park that's like you know hey we've got the infrastructure and all that built out but it wouldn't be large data centers because that's the question yeah because even that question I don't know that we're a great site for that because of electricity costs right put it on the Dows because they what sometimes these companies want is they don't want to be totally dependent upon the utility they want to have a data center that serves their particular facility and and you know sometimes that's what these the larger companies are looking for these tech companies I don't know a lot about this we're not experts right but I would say a minor data center especially was sure with Broadband if they have to sign for smart to get a policy around this because with AI we need to be data centers are going to be popping up like and they are heavy user of electricity all them them don't speak to it what's the 100% silence on data centers and that's where we do get requests and I you know I answer the I basically say it's it's not in the code and I really don't want to make that call and I really don't want Planning Commission to make that call if our hand is for through a land use application I'd rather get it to you guys first and get and get some clear from you guys um so I think I know it's a Hot Topic so hope we can move on and I think just giving you guys a heads up it might be that's an example of something we would address through this Cod and talking anecdotally talking to some of my peers out in Central and Eastern Oregon there's regret data Cent it's been more problem than it's been worth Y and so I think it's I think it should be good to have that discussion and have you guys as a as a policy board make that call um on our show a",

hear you in my headphones instead I always have to do this when I switch back over to WebEx from teams okay I'll try hello there good afternoon everybody thank you so much for joining our home energy rebate discussion today starting a couple minutes late just give everybody a chance to join the chat and to log into the the webinar um my name is Emily salary um if you've joined us before you've probably met um myself and some of my colleagues that'll be joining me today I am our federal grants officer here at the Oregon Department of energy and um we're going to be talking a little bit about home Energy rebates that we're anticipating coming to the state of Oregon um this year hopefully all right next slide please so for today's agenda what we'll do is we'll start with um an introduction to the funding and where it comes from um from the federal government a little bit about the rough timeline that we've been looking at um as well as some related programs that we have going on not only here at Odo but um elsewhere in the state and the justice 40 initiative and how it relates to these programs um we'll do a high level um intro to the here program as well as the homes program and how they relate to each other and we'll give some time for um some clarifying questions if anybody that has some that come up as we're speaking and then what we'll do is we'll jump into the program design and implementation some areas where we've had some um ability to make some determinations as we've been going through our application um and then at the end we'll have a little bit extra time hopefully for some um guided questions that we have to ask of you all that are joining us today next slide please all right and before we jump in um I know that many of you have joined us before and you've heard me probably say this or others say this um but this is just a qu quick uction if you don't know what the Oregon Department of energy or uh as you'll hear many of us say today Odo is how we uh we call ourselves um lots of acronyms um so this is just an introduction as to what we do so you'll see on the slide our vision our mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly B balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations and then under what we do you'll see the services that we provide and how we achieve our mission the funding opportunity we're discussing today will help Odo support resilient and affordable Energy System as well as a clean energy transition next slide please okay and then um for those of you that are new to WebEx there's a lot going on here I'm sure you see um here's a quick guide on how you can use some of the features um attendees are going to be off camera and muted but our host can unmute you if um if we can call on you to ask a question that might come up and then you'll see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of the screen under participants panel um if you click near your name there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar and feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments and um just make sure that you send to all panelists or everyone so that all of the oo staff can see it we'll be taking turns you know talking with you guys so we can um we can all help respond if you have questions that come up and then we'll try to get to as many of your questions in the chat or through raised hands but we may not have time to get to all of them today although we hope so um and then I I see that maybe a few people have called in on the phone um you can press star six to raise your hand and Then star three to unmute yourself when we call on you if you're on your phone and the the host will unmute you from our end and then I just want to make sure that everybody knows that today's listening session is being recorded um and then the recording will will be posted to our website later on um this week maybe tomorrow next slide please okay jumping right in so we will talk about the home Energy rebates collectively oftentimes and I just want to make sure that it's understood that these are two separate but complimentary Grant programs that are available to Oregon from the US Department of energy and you'll hear us call them us doe um Oregon has to apply for these federal dollars through a Grant application process which includes laying out a plan for how to offer rebates to Residents within the state for Approved purposes and um these are these are two programs that are available to us from Congress which passed the um the inflation reduction act or the IRA in 2022 it included lots of Grants tax incentives and rebates um but you'll see here the homes program is the acronym for Home Efficiency rebate program and this one is going to be more of a performance-based rebate for efficiency uh retrofits to homes that are existing and then the here program is uh the home electrification and appliance rebate program this one is more for rebates for high efficiency electric appliances and certain um upgrades that are associated with that one thing that I just want to mention about um about the the application process is that many of the programs policies were laid out in the federal guidance but many are left to the stat determine and that's some of the things that um Stephanie and um Christina will talk to you a little bit more about later on um they'll give an overview of each of the programs and then and then we'll ask you some some questions later on for things that we still have yet to consider um one thing I also want to make clear is that we we don't have these funds for these programs until the applications have been accepted and Christina will go through a timeline later on um about um what we're looking forward to over the next several months and um and thereafter so designing the programs takes a lot of careful planning but we we understand the excitement the anticipation and we're working hard to have our application submitted and therefore have rebates available um much sooner to to all of you um the the funding um application is due to the US Department of energy by um January 31st 2025 next slide please okay another thing I just want to call out is um we have seen some confusion about rebates and tax credits and it's just making clear that they are two different things the the IRA made um both of these things available to the the public um so unlike the the home Energy rebates there's something called the energy efficient home improvement credit it's available right now through IRS so if you're filing your taxes right now these these tax credits are available um and and you can um apply for them as you file your taxes whereas the home Energy rebates are going to be Min administered at the state level not through the IRS um and so those rebates will talk about how how some of the details we're still sorting through but some of the details um we can share with how they might be administered um later on um here's a couple of bullets to about uh details on the tax credits they um can reduce your federal tax LOE um the credits are up to $3,200 you'll file them as I mentioned with your tax return um they're available for your primary residents in most cases and um and there's a few more details here as well as some links um I'm hoping that maybe um one of my colleagues might be able to drop some of these links in the chat for you all another thing I just want to mention is that Odo staff are not tax professional so just make sure that if you're interested in some of these tax credits that you um you you speak with a licensed tax professional about the tax credits all right next slide all right and then um a few different bubbles here that you'll see these are different um different programs that we're working on and um how the home Energy rebates might align with the program goals that we have internally at the Oregon Department of energy and policies from some several different complimentary programs that are already existing or that we're currently working on so um as you know we're talking about homes in here the home Energy rebates today um those programs are going to be supported by the um Trek program which is going to be a Workforce Development program um as well as we have the opportunity to apply for an energy auditor training Grant which um the Tre program they're both Workforce related the Tre program is more for um training energy contractors um and the energy auditor uh program is aimed at specifically energy Auditors the Tre program is a Formula allocation that um we will have coming to the state which um just means that as long as we follow the provisions and that we hit all the targets on the application we should definitely see those funds coming our way um whereas the energy auditor training Grant or eat as we like to call it is going to be um competitive so we're not guaranteed those funds but hopefully both of those work together to sort of ramp up the the training and the workforce that's going to be needed to deploy some of these rebates that we that we have coming our way as well um other things that we have going on at the state are our heat pump programs so we've got two state funded heat pump programs one is the community heat pump deployment program and that's implemented by Regional Partners it's about $10 million in program offering incentives to support heat pump installations for homeowners and then the other one is our Oregon Rental Heat home heat Pub program um that one is $15 million and it's implemented by Odo and it's supporting heat pump installations and rental homes um we also have um been coordinating with other entities in our state and we understand that there are lots of other existing rebate programs and we have been working really hard to best understand how we can integrate these Federal rebates into the existing landscape and and and fit it into the equation between the community- based organizations that have rebates available utility program",

issues that may arise but maybe they won't at all if we're lucky next slide please i'm going to pass it to my colleague rob for our overview of the agenda all right thank you ruchi and for those of you who don't already know me i see i see some familiar faces but um some that i'm just meeting now so i'm rob delmar i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and i am responsible for helping to get this program on its feet until we hire the new staff that are going to take it over to run the program next year so my job has been to just help facilitate the process thank you all again for being here and for agreeing to help us out with this um here's our agenda i also noticed that often it appears that i'm kind of staring off into space on this format i've got three different monitors going and uh so i'm looking here and there but i promise i'm paying attention starting off with welcomes object objectives and logistics and we can check one off that one's done next we're going to go to introductions and we're just going to do a round table with all of our members that are present and get to know each other a little bit following that we will do an orientation where we go through the bill and highlight the the key parts of the bill that make up this program but also some of the other parts of the bill that are keeping oto busy with some studies and things like that so we'll give a good overview of house bill 2021 which created this program then we will talk a little bit about the advisory committee and how we're going to operate try to kind of get at a charter for our hopefully together we can all arrive at a good understanding of just how this group can advise oregon department of energy both in the development of the program in implementing the program as we um you know look for projects over the next four years to fund then we get a much earned break and following the break we will discuss the key questions that we shared with you last friday via email we will have basically a slide for each following the discussion of the we will just have a quick pass at next and talk about the next meeting which we hope to have sometime in the middle of finally from 4 30 to 5 we will have the platform open for public comment but assuming we get through everything else on the agenda we won't actually be having advisory committee content at that point you all are welcome to depart at that time and we can handle the public comment um obviously if you would like to stay you're more than welcome to do that for our objectives really what we're looking at here is um just exactly what is it that odo has to to make this new program that came from the legislature last session successful and the advisory committee is a big part of that so thank you for agreeing to serve i know this is a long meeting and we're going to have some more so but our objective is to work with you the advisory committee other interested stakeholders tribes to develop and adopt rules for the new community renewable energy grant program and once we have the rules established that's really just the starting point and from there we need to administer the program for four years to accomplish the program the bill does a pretty good job of describing those goals and we'll see those in a minute but really it's about providing grants to encourage community renewable energy and energy resilience projects both planning and construction of these we really want to get the program to all the far corners of the state and make sure that we are reaching out to the environmental justice communities and um doing a good job of meeting the intent of that bill so that's our objective and i think with that said if there's no immediate questions i'd like to just kick into the introductions and round table and so i'm gonna pull up this list and this is a list of our advisory committee right now it's in the order in which it on in-house bill 2021 for their prescription for how we put this committee together i think we will just go down this list and so the only person who's really on the hook here is quinn and everyone else will get a little preview for when they're um when their time is going to come and we just want to an introduction a little bit about your um you know what you're up to and we have a prompting question down at the bottom which is to describe a project that you imagine being funded by the community renewable energy program and so with that said i'm going to just go down this list and in some cases we may hit names of folks who are not able to attend today i see it's a pretty long list so if i call out a name of someone who's not here we'll just we'll just move on to the next so with that said um quinn reed if you're on please take the mic and introduce yourself good afternoon my name is quinn reed and as it says on the list here i am currently a member of the governor's environmental justice task force i'm also the oregon policy director for the center for biological diversity i live in portland with my family and we are all common sense looking for a house in portland right now so i suppose something that's front of mind for me um this program would be projects to help homeowners particularly low-income homeowners access programs funds to participate in a renewable energy economy great thank you quinn happy to have you mark brady yeah hi mark brady i'm with business oregon which for those who don't know we're the state economic development agency um and i'm part of our innovation and entrepreneurship team i'm on the innovation side of that team there's about six of us in total my work focuses a lot on what we call the oregon innovation council that guides us in making targeted investments in supporting early stage businesses and innovations in oregon and i also do some work with oregon manufacturing innovation center and a couple of other uh and i do live in portland as well i guess the project you yeah catching me off guard here obviously is all of us but um i guess i would look at a rural uh energy project and say like a digester or maybe a biomass type project would be kind of the first things that came to mind whenever at that prompt yeah that would be really nice if we see some digester and biomass type projects in this program really hope that we're able to reach out into the communities and and stir up projects like that before we move on to keisha i just want to make one note that these the first on this list and i'm talking about the left half of this list where it references the environmental justice task force and business oregon both of these entities are referenced separately in the bill as collaborators for developing the program and so we see your participation in this committee and advising us in this process as as you know meeting part of that intent in the bill of of reaching out to your agencies for support so we're really excited to have coin and mark not only as our advisory committee members but also as liaisons to business oregon and the environmental justice task force to get that broader input into the program so with that i think we'll move to keyshow hey everyone felicia light um as noted i'm the representative for electric companies working at portland general and um spend most of my time with pge working on new customer solutions but i've also done work on renewable energy projects i'd say for me you know when i think about pge and what we'd like to see with our communities a project that is any projects that are available to our municipalities or cities that provide for um provide that resiliency that's necessary in ej communities within the cities especially that when you think about wastewater treatment facilities and you know those those critical infrastructure buildings yeah i think and kind of flying off the cuff and i and as was mentioned by mark definitely rural areas that providing that resiliency there but i'd say um close to home right now is facilities that uh providing that resiliency for some of the critical infrastructure within our cities and counties it's a really good point bringing up these facilities that handle water either on the supply side or on the wastewater treatment side that we have these very critical facilities that are also often very high users of electricity so really prime targets for resilience projects within communities we've already seen some successful projects in oregon along those lines and i hope we see a lot more thank you for that introduction and we will move on to dale malcolm with central lincoln hi i'm dale malcolm i'm a senior project manager here at central lincoln we're a small a relatively small utility on the central oregon coast i guess when i think about in general i'm thinking about maybe projects that smaller utilities or like you guys said rural communities could do for resiliency in terms of you know here on the oregon coast we have the earthquake issue we have the tsunami issue we have too much wind or too little wind for um turbines you know we it it's difficult to find an alternative energy source you know all of our energy comes from bpa along lines that we all share out here to the coast and so i don't have a particular project in mind but but something that's doable um administratively i guess for smaller would be something that i had in mind yeah we're really happy to have some representatives along the coastal with us today and we recognize that the coast is kind of unique in that it has yet one additional natural disaster on top of all of the other ones that could potentially happen in oregon with tsunamis and so we recognize coastal communities as being very strategic partners in this program and with that said i think it's a good um good time to introduce shannon souza with soulcoast um i'm shannon i'm talking to you from another one of those coastal communities let's see i've got four hats i'm wearing since 2003 i've had a solar contracting and consulting business so both doing the assessment feasibility and the contracting down here i'm the executive director for a new non-profit oregon coast energy alliance network that's specifically focusing on clean secure energy for coastal i'm the policy director for pacific ocean energy trust so speaking of",

        "text": " where we I think it's good that that's next yeah are we meeting again in January this this group right now is scheduled to meet again January 24th for the best because this is the December pullover but as you wish I wish yeah uh anything else this is something else think I don't want to I think we've had a healthy conversation I don't want to get too spraw out in our conversation I want to be able to retain things and think about dig them my not say be up so not the change of subject but the Sal Salem speaks up I feel like there's potential there to have kind of more Community listening sessions did you go how was it I I talk about it briefly last time but I mean there there it was it was limited that the people who showed up were the ones who wanted to speak I think almost everybody's spoke because that was what they came to do but so it was kind of like a Ian this is not the like preaching to the choir kind of thing is what comes to mind that's not really what it was but but somebody even said this is great but we need to get more people here to listen you know um because you know it was a fairly limited group but it was good I mean it was I think it was really good I think a couple of the people said that they had just heard about it like kind of word of mouth so I think if we can do better at getting whichever group you know the word out there um maybe a speak a speak and be heard session as a person just to speak and my own personal input which is where it was and I'm glad that Lisa was able to get the room at the Y but it was kind of hard to get to you know it was and so I feel like some people may have been intimidated by just like I don't even want to go in the building L Al and try and navigate way to find where the room is so somewhere closer to like the sidewalk that people can actually get in and out of more because it was I I think it was it was was the one even open at the time I feel like we well if memory serves they had want another space that was more accessible but another event going on I wasn't part of the planning but I remember yeah Lisa saying that plus the why is new and I don't think anyone's really familar with the new why no I'm not I used to go there all the time yeah but I feel like it was I feel like it was good the people who did speak had yeah something to say I mean that's good yeah yeah I don't know if you had a different take on it I'm trying to recall the debrief from the that committee debriefed and I'm I'm trying to recall the themes in that debrief um there was another meeting up on but it was up on the third floor but that was their larger room okay that's um so the point about being straight off the sidewalk is a good point I'm not sure if the facility has a straight off the sidewalk room but they may they may they get a nice tour I don't know yeah so that's a good point that's a that's a good point just if someone is uncomfortable walking among the weight machines and you know through all the stuff you did you had to go to the second floor and then through the weight space and yeah to get to the space that's true yeah yeah I I feel like there's there's opportunities there to to have more some of listening SE quarterly listening session or something or just just come talk to us what do you what do you have to say yeah maybe you know maybe it's something we can do something about maybe it's not but but just getting that a chance to come in share their experiences or their thoughts yeah um it's a good point I think um I think that be more or less easy enough to do it's just a matter of getting people to come getting the word out on that yeah always be a challenge I mean even a for will come that's fine but you youd want 40 you right right well making sure the right people are in the room I mean you know mayor was there and I think it was it wasn't the city manager it was the we had the manager and mayor Hoy and then a deputy chief of police that's right as three people who arve to listen um member of the school board are you talking about reping s speaks up again or for the HRC I'm I'm thinking for the HRC yeah yeah yeah I mean just just seeing how that event went I was I wasn't sure going into it because I had never been to one before what it was going to be like and I was like this is actually actually it kind of you know it felt I mean I imagine if more people come to share we might hear I feel like it was well maybe I'm wrong but it was all people who had it was part of their work their daily work and sharing what they what they learn and what they know and what they want to see and itable some way yeah but yeah you but historically the push from the planning committee is there that what I've seen is the committee has historically wished for individuals to come and share their individual experience and how do we get those people yeah and often what you have as groups who come and kind of summarize what they hearing or talk about what they're seeing and yeah who the school was there you remember well SE SE I'm not sure yeah yeah I'm not sure how to say his name the person who then subsequently submitted comment to us yeah oh did he yeah so we have a public comment for next week's commission meeting in the email packet so as a followup his first and I say this as he told me his first encounter with B was at our tailing event oh at the 50 55th anniversary of the thing oh very good he came downstairs he and I spoke good and I gave him ourti information he had never heard of us before and that was what years ago so yeah good and so I'm glad that he's retained that he and I have not spoken since though that's he's had that in his mind there you go although we we do have friends on the school SCH board because G is on the school board and might on the school board and people that I know I work with and friend might be something to reach out to to I I grew up with that be a thing um not appropo of anything I have a few questions about uh first landmarks collaboration Vis of be the the new what is the the Cemetery MH work MH um and then uh you you so generously remind me I don't know where we are with the Latino event that's coming up in Fr February any updates about either uh the quen Ming Festival I have not heard anything about but yet I don't know if they've started the plan I replied to that great it's typically in the spring and so I don't know if they've started yet yeah that's what I want to say too so we can follow up and see I haven't heard about anything getting started the Spanish resource fair is next month yes um I just updated our Google spreadsheet today in fact you know because we have a place to sign up for events and I put your name down for for our conversation I did um I want to say someone reached out from the city yeah I think she did yeah can you talk me more about the event sure um it's the second annual it's intended to be a resource Fair um as much as possible in Spanish for people for whom Spanish is their preferred language and so last year for example it was um a whole bunch of tables I want to say 30 tables and a lot of City departments represented but then also groups that do services for people were there as well like I remember coming for Human Rights Commission and being next to the fire department for example and he spoke Spanish so that helped me and it was just mingling with people who were walking through the tables and people were getting information about the services I was impressed with how well it was intended it was the first one and I would describe it as a a much more active tabling experience than I have at other events yeah so it's it's going to be the second one this year and you put me down for that I did so in addition to that respond to I forget her name now I'm sorry to say that's okay but I will GL her great thank you yeah yeah is that is that all only other two things that we have right on or was there um a third Thread about was there something about C involvement with wellit's archaeological site for the on their campus about the Indian um uh labor school that was on on the there's conversation we had with with Lisa there was I can't remember if there was a next on that but we can that was also those are Community engagement yeah things absolutely absolutely any uh member remarks or questions or concerns uh well no I just say I saw that a couple of emails came out from I have not had a chance to look at them but I'm assuming it's about the meeting next s materials meeting next week I sent y I did and then I sent the year in review today too because we got the web page up to reflect the belonging survey so I thought I was able to get that out thank you for that you're welcome yeah and thank you both for your engagement and uh we'll have hopefully a corre conversation at the meeting next week too very good and happy New Year to those at home who I have my back to the whole time",

        "text": " my understanding trying to do routing solar panels through southern other Southeast Asian Nations and so by the administration did another evaluation because uh I don't remember the company but some solar production company in the U.S triggered a revaluation the fighting Administration looked at that allowed it to continue just to go through those Southeast asianations but for a limited time period so it's still allowed to come in you know presumably cheaper than the US sort of produced solar panels but for a limited time period and then they will reevaluate whether they shut those off you know they put a limit on single weapon coming to the U.S first time you know U.S production yeah so there's these are the things that you know as chairman mentioned has nothing to do with us directly but can certainly have a huge impact on please projects come in when they can begin instruction when they legitimately need to request the time extensions so there's there's a lot of things you know could be a tax incentive at the federal level it could be you know the ability to get components whether it's Supply chains there's a lot of other factors again don't direct their ability to us we can have a pretty huge impact on working forward what can so we you know it's not really our job to open crap of those but we try to keep an eye on them and have started what's that is Boardman started for the record again so I'm going to go and show I'm going to go back to the board in the Solar again Wastewater Pipeline and a 200 substation the carbon substation construction of Liberty substation starting in May of 28 to 1.1 and was completed in December 12th construction of the septic system will start it on August 9 2021 was completed on September 10 2011. so now construction of the admin construction of the admin building and has approved in the violent order amendment 2 is expected to convince the fourth quarter of 2012. so they're still going including the preconstruction the administration this administration building will be approximately six feet by one kilometer by 120 feet and it's adjacent to unit 1. then we have the Montague solar facility it's an improved solar opaque uh energy generated facility with the 18K generated capacity of 162 megawatts they've been used or occupy up to 1189 Acres of exclusive Farm new Zone landed together site certificate holders uh approximately 50 of them within a solution soldiers solar modules we're on the track to be ready to go uh Cod commercial operation David um by the end of December 2022. so as you're going through these you know there are any facilities that you like you as a council would like to see more individually you know if we're a council meeting community and we're in pharmaceutity you know we can we get attempt to set up site visits for any of these facilities whether they're in construction reconstruction operation so certainly is valuable to get out there and actually see what you said you go back on the landscape but I think it's all throughout different times you know in that sort of construction cycle so you know would not make that decision certainly today but but it would be helpful to know if you know any room or maybe being single or a couple accounts would like to get out and see somebody facilitate because they could have something that happens it's a lot easier now looking for in so this is handling chair and being the old fighter I would really recommend that you get on CDC I was shocked to see the current generation station the substation was under construction at the time and Boardman Boulevard the same site visit I mean it was going to be Fusion perspective yeah actually really the wipes stay in the facility so but we're that's near let's make a field trip to it tell them we're there yes because we started you have more meetings you know outside of Seattle women's area as we will look to be creative opportunities during the construction and during operation two totally different things especially with the solar and I think we're going to continue to see Obama interests again just just from the Department of regular cultures you're changing our landscape and getting a feel for what that those lines can impacts look like not not that they're good or bad just seeing how that that understanding as people come in and say you're going to change our viewer you know whatever but um and this may not be appropriate but but we take a lot of compliance things yes I think that would be fascinating oh that's that's just that was wondering if it was a program I just I think it would be interesting to know what you're looking for again when the night towards you know are there other conditions we should be thinking about are the ways that wanting to the conditions and yeah during doing presentation we always offer that so if um you know if if for example you know you say I actually didn't want to go online can you keep me in the loop on when you're conducting these so you know and then we can basically let you know and then wherever one works out for you um we can make that happen so I mean obviously be council members as well like yes I think it would give a different so let's talk about Shepherd's platform Central or South they're both all three European miniature and greet our replacement blades about spear boxes so Shepherds uh flat and work with some different kind of construction started in August of 2021 the check was flat and went there's four percent down and their home percent completed at the end of the main at the end of May restoration of impact is on volume of Deacon packs and Hyper seed Hydro Seating activities going forward we've been a Central Central Construction started and started October 2021. when uh so Shepherd's flat Central is 19 completely a turbine select to uh repolar and then they're actually in restoration and they're doing Restorations going on ongoing and the need compassion with them by proceeding activities as well and then Shepherd's plot of some construction started a lot overlooked only building one initiative 12 summons 58 complete foreign a little bit later in state language projects state line is so let's see I wanted to is operating with Advanced simple two just starting their wind uh terribly followable territory power includes removal replacing our turbine Hub blade motor gearboxes and the cells free power would result in the increased certain capacity from 2.3 megawatts to 2.66 megawatts energy generating the facility that consists of 72 wind turbines so we keep peaking capacity and generating capacity 194.4 megawatts this facility is under construction laws after building one mile access road construction of the facility involves must be conducted by august 19 2023. conditions you saw all detail in that you know and you know we saw the prior slide with all of the operational facilities and there are numerous safety conditions that have been evaluated but each one of those who can relief then you start adding instruction projects and thinking about the volume of reconstruction and construction conditions that have to be evaluated legitimately is is incredible I mean the volume of in any assessment and details of some of those individual conditions are not complexity B so the numbers of facilities that not only your new construction but you know again operational facilities and construction facilities this is where you're here in Iran why we're trying to increase the resources associated with the compliance program because there's just so much of it there's just really so much of it it is uh it is very significant and again recently looking at those conditions and important Hemingways and look at the numbers that William is talking about manager do the math on that it's it's a lot of work for the records so I can stop again so this is my assist slide represents the facilities that under construction Orbee so we have the blue one I just talked about right there Summer Ridge that someone written construction files like I said before and we have the solar facility modern egg uh date or you can uh Bake Oven down here so it's uh he's the mop and these facilities over here and then Shepherd's glass Central north south North Central right in this area the south side of the world solar facility that's so under construction destruction box as well yeah that's never been in construction no it never did yeah yeah so um yeah so still still we're still sorry to begin you know their time extension to the beginning so that one is not an issue at all selectively now and Escape at the moment so let's go ahead and move on over to my compliance floor plan and it's like what's Tom was saying that this is this compliance program it speaks kind of just in basically everything that we do so I was thinking about we're doing the process and bringing to the denominators as we both so you know so let's go ahead and get started so we'll start with facility and inspections so operating facilities that staff and eventually to say these annually however for some of the older facilities of desktop or a writing your own site inspection maybe more appropriate a virtual desk audit inspection is used to conduct an inspection remotely using teams are a little similar to format for the Department staff and certificate holders can still meet face-to-face and have the ability to review records conduct interviews save travel funding save the travel expenses and avoidance frequency of on-site inspections is determined based on such certification difference required such as doctors that weed control revegetation habitat mitigation plans and recent agencies uh issues such as fire skills or accidents and then large facilities may require several days or multiple persons to complete the obsession you know site inspections for facilities located in the same geographic area and are scheduled to get an impossible to maximize efficiency and then my savops of birds angle right now we're trying to get a person generating purpose of power on the same made usually is what I do is having conduct and think about buying the mid session in the morning or maybe donating with January and finish out in the day so when we knock down two in one day and I have to travel we usually about anything for example okay the facilities of reconstruction required conditions are reviewed and improved by site by citing division staff who are building compliance officers senior citing analysts senior policy advisor operations and policy analysts and studying policy analysts school coordinator as necessary in applicable and applicable Department energy staff rely on state agencies local government tribal governments and Consultants were necessary and sections are done as needed to ensure site site certificate conditions are being met or a typical site one or more pre-construction site visits or prior",

through the agenda today maybe I would should I hold until we have starts um maybe what we can do just to kind of buy time is to go around and do some of the introduction now we didn't want to go around a room and just see what brings you care today what your name is which your organization is and just kind of what you're most interested in learning so why don't we start with that um you hear myself a little bit but then once we're ready to go very future corporate right now welcome to the Future Yes Virginia we want to start with you and we'll just go around sure Robert Delmar of senior

together and pass it off to our programs team to run save the time right Rick Williams we're going to apply research and graduate faculty at Portland State University teaching strategies for reasons fantastic any particular interest in today's session anything that you're hoping to get out of this yes um the continuity of essential services for communities and who's responsible for that okay fantastic hi everybody I'm almost one of two grants officers that we have here now and I'll be working with guap to help get the program um submitted to um US Department of energy and going on I'm Sarah Marquees items a community navigator for Bordeaux and it's my second day of work Keith Brooks and the General Andrew Douglas selector Cochran located outside of Roseburg a lot of rural communities and we are just trying to figure out how we can build it the most resilient with a very limited customer base to spread those cost across so we see this as a huge opportunity uh really value experiences to our community and just want the environment process as well I'm the assistant general manager I'm here for the same reasons as he using them specifically an interested in making sure that we're well aware of all of the program environments in the prosperities getting everything in in accordance with what we do to truly prior funding and get to keep it that's okay which actually prompts me to ask a c handouts did everyone get a copy of handouts if they're interested in all those hi everyone Ruchi severe at Oregon Department of energy Association engagement and I get to work with with everyone here online as well I have Ellen shower I'm an average manager with Energy Trust Oregon new buildings for me and I look with public projects and I'm just uh I don't want to hear what's happening whether the big red Brazilians and how that might connect up with buildings potentially um better with good morning my name is Brittany Davidson I'm with the organ room Association and I'm here today to learn a little bit more about the program so that we can help employers who are interested in to an uptake case I'm the executive director of the organ Association it's Brandon said we have 18 liner costs of State all of them are interested in this we have some here today the person might expect some online so here we learned thank you I Hannah dondly Kaplan I'm with Bonneville power and I'm the Oregon liaison it's in the state um so just to hear a little learn yeah what's going on and see where maybe we're over in Los Angeles with our customers are going to be good incentives programs that learn what's coming my way I'm Jennifer Jolly I'm with the Oregon Municipal electric um utilities Association and we have 11 city-owned consumer owned utilities like co-ops and mostly with that group and I'm again looking to see what requirements are and and whether cities would be good candidates for for some of these friends photo it data to make sure people can see the video good morning I'm Katie toskey I work with Christy at Equity Consulting and we're really honored to be supporting Odo for this initiative it's a real pleasure to meet all of you this morning thank you for being here all right so I think if we're all good to move forward we can move into the agenda and just some of these pictures online too oh we can I know we did ask them to put all of their information in the chat um and we can do yeah I'm not signed in that well and I was just trying to see if I'm not on the web app you might be able to just read out the chat let's do that I have the Danish okay so uh joining us virtually we have uh Tom mcfarger from the city of Ashland electric utility Lee Elder from Pacific Corps uh Janine Benner director of Odo uh Faith Yoruba from

we do have a lot to cover today um and just to kind of go through some of the housekeeping notes um first we want to make sure you do understand how the screwed resilience funding works and the narrative that Odo recently submitted to the U.S department of energy based in a large part on feedback and receiving new people in this room and people on the chat so thank you very um this approach was developed over the past year in post-consultation like okuc and it was informed by Outreach and experts working on space um Second and most importantly today we would love your input and feedback to continue to improve our program design such as Community benefits I know that came up today as an interest so we'll be talking about that the competitive scoring criteria includes to evaluate things projects and lessons learned from past projects that you've all implemented in the past um so we just want to align this work that is already being done with utilities and others into better meet the objectives outlined and better than funding opportunity and then third I know there was interest in this as well and as we've mentioned there are handouts here for all of the federal rules and regulations we've also posted them on the website so they're available to those virtually if you're interested in following along but rules and applications regarding data statement justice 40 and by America building that as well and then just for everyone on the chat to do a little bit of housekeeping as well for those of you who are new to WebEx there's a quick guide with some features so attendees are off camera and they are looted but we do have a host who will be able to unmute you if you have questions um you can see the option to raise your hand on both of the screen so you can split questions in the chat or you can raise your hand and leave people from Odo and from Priority both kind of monitoring this to make sure that we get to everyone's questions um so feel that they use the chat function to use your ask questions or make comments they just ask that you please send this to all the participants um so that everyone can see and it's it's a group design um I think that covers it for housekeeping and just know because we are trying to facilitate and as you've already witnessed by a virtual in person and we really want to hear feedback from everyone we'll Foster discussion but if we need to kind of move along in the essence of time and just raise our hand and just say you don't have to your final thought to keep it moving so that we can show you very much thank you and I think with that any last questions in terms of how this will flow today by the way so to please pass it opportunity so many of you might have seen the slide before but just in case kind of our duty to make sure we know how this all fits together um really big thanks to our Consultants here from have your knee um as well as all of you who are doing that are open house um if you don't know me my name is associate director engagement here at Odo so as you've heard you're going to hear a little bit about how about to the point we're at with you know what we want to see in the process and I'm actually really excited to hear from all the news some examples um projects that you're working on or how you think about Community benefits in a really informed how we take those program to the next iteration of developing criteria um and help us think about how to do sort of a selection process um as well this um this five over here talks about our our mission it's a little introduction to Odo if you don't know uh we are here to help oregonians to make informed decisions to maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shave Network evolved in energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly about and your needs impacts for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see kind of the way that we beat the mission and there's a lot of programs and divisions here at Odo exciting we have a big report that we do every year we run programs that um on getting bandages with the from the legislature has assigned to us and for this funding opportunity that we're talking about today it will be a new energy program at Odo um that's you know federally funded and it will help the support a resilient and affordable MLP system that kind of links back to our mission next slide please um this is another sort of orienting slide in the picture and after the passage of both the iija and the inflation reduction act Oda recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government and the purpose of that is to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency resilience and other important priorities we did a number of public weapons and we discussed with our energy advisory work group early one of these law scores",

        "text": " verified reparan habitat they need to demonstrate uh compliance with reparan habitat standards again those are um distinct and I would say uh more comparable to what's in place today for repairi and habitat if the proposed development is within verified Upland repair and Upland wildlife habitat uh applicants get one of three options they can choose the tree inventory and retention option that is the clear and objective option as you probably are well aware we need to have a clear a a path that is clear and objective for applicants to apply however sometimes that doesn't work in some situations and we recognize that so we're also including also includes um a tree canopy and assessment um and protection CER I'll talk a little bit about each of these um that option is available to the applicant as well as a detailed environmental uh report option finally if the applicant believes the map is incorrect they can request a map correction so those the basic requirements now focusing in on repair and wildlife habitat there are use limitations for those areas that's comparable to today that's those requirement ments are very similar to today and uh there are exceptions for certain types of activities we've done our best to make those exceptions clear and objective I think we've succeeded but be looking forward to hearing your thoughts on that um and uh there are as I mentioned three options for Upland wildlife habitat option one this is our clear and objective track required by state law the idea is that applicants would inventory and assess native trees greater than six Ines in diameter and these would be the trees within this significant habitat boundary but out and again we're focused in this area on being outside repairing wildlife habitat boundary because those areas are subject to other regulations primarily through clean services so um but for these areas they're uh we would be looking at regulated trees the types of tree each tree gets assigned points based on its circumference or EXP diameter and um as well as whether it is a specific species they are identified specific species get extra shall we say bonus points and also trees that are um approximate to repair in areas get some bonus points as well the requirement is that a certain percentage of the tree points be retained on site or if they can't be replaced if they can't be retained you can't maintain the percentage then um they need to be replaced or uh with other tree points and I'll talk about that now so um there's a special exception to make it for very small projects whether they're impacting 10 or fewer trees they don't have to do the full inventory they can just inventory the trees that they're impacting but otherwise um they would be if it's again here we are with this adoption date um if it's in the um PR2 2006 ugb 50% of the tree points um would need to be it's uh in the in the later adopted areas the post5 it's 80% of the tree points and uh again I think as Michelle pointed out there's Metro there uh title 13 has specific requirements for those newer Urban growth B uh new newer Urban growth area expansions so um we're trying to reflect that in these standards the um applicant who if they need to make up loss tree points it's possible that they could do their development no problem REM m still maintaining the necessary amount of tree points they're done if they can't if they need to make up lost tree points there's a wide range of options they can preserve existing native trees that are not regulated trees because they're smaller than 6 inches um dbh or they can plant new native trees the replacement trees can be inside or outside this significant habitat boundary but not inside the verified reparan wildlife habitat boundary and um we they do get more points of course because we're trying to encourage them to replace trees in with significant habitat boundary those are worth more points but still there's a lot of flexibility there with how they can accomplish those three points and that's uh intended to make sure that that clear and objective option works for most people if but if it doesn't um there is a what we're calling the tree canopy assessment and protection option and uh that is uh not entirely clear and objective so it will require some discretion on the part of Staff making that decision but that discretion is relatively limited um it that is an option that's allowed under state law if there's a clear and objective path you can offer a discretionary path or paths as well um they have to offer a similar or greater level of protection as a clear of itive path and I think we've done that it's a it's a different approach so in the canopy protection um the idea is that you would instead of just protect I should say just but instead of protecting trees within the entire habitat area and maintaining points you're identifying a specific area within the significant habitat Area 25 to 30% the lower percentage is available if you are um if you're canopy protection area is abutting a repairing area and there's a require specific requirements for how much it has to abut but you would be able to do the 25% 30% um and within that area uh the requirement is to maintain a 75% uh canopy cover and that canopy cover if it if it doesn't exist today there's options to plant trees and to estimate what the tree canopy would be in within a spec specified time frame so again that's an option that applicants choose uh to meet the standard and then finally there's an option in the code for a detailed environmental uh report requirement this would be much more discretionary um it does require a very detailed environmental report to be prepared has very detailed submittal requirements and approval criteria um we expect it's going to be a type review um and it would likely or possibly require the county to seek um out additional technical expertise because it will be a very technical report that the applicant is submitting and uh so potentially the cost of s such a thing would be included in the fees for that and again that's um that would be a third option if the other two options don't work it is at least as protective if not more than the other options but it has some flexibility um to accomplish uh different types of um mitigation oh and I'm gonna hand it back to Michelle with that I got enthralled with your presentation so um based on the board's direction we have been busy with a robust plan for Community engagement over the entire uh 18 months time period um we started with some um summer Outreach um at community events U about a year ago um all across the uh County including two culturally based events and we shared project information at farmers markets for example places like that um for the fall Outreach uh we mailed out those uh letters that I spoke about to Property Owners with mapped significant natural resources letting them know about the project and an invite to attend an in-person Forum or um participated in an online openhouse um that ran for about 6 weeks and we um made that property owner uh lookup tool available to people um and that's still kind of an ongoing um an ongoing resource for people to to use as well in the spring we followed up with postcards to these same Property Owners letting them know about three different Outreach opportunities that we had in March and in April and there have been ongoing meetings with interested property owners affected agencies um developers the committee for Community involvement significant natural resources subcommittee technical experts and individual um Property Owners as well our communication team has been busy with website and social media updates as well so regarding our efforts um as of last check we had uh 463 people on our interested parties list and um 275 people have commented on the online map lookup tool meaning they had questions about the um mapped resource on their property or they might have dis disagreed with where it was located and wanted to give us more information so we had a lot of followup to do um using our um environmental consultant team to um to investigate um those particular properties that came to our attention 32 people were at the in-person fall Community Forum that we had and we had 70 people comment on the online open house this spring 113 people were at the virtual and in-person spring Community Forum so we had one virtual um Forum as well as two in-person forums one at uh the Cedar Hills um rec center and one here out at Washington Street so we really tried to um go to where the people were and and try a variety of means to to get the word out about the project and get Fe feedback we've received well over 75 emails and phone calls about the project um to the questions that people might have andich if I can just add um those events and uh everything that we sent out were bilingual so we were trying to reach all communities um and so we had translators and our materials were translated as well thanks Teresa um so we really have heard many diverse U viewpoints on this topic um so I expect that that's maybe what you will also be hearing through the through the testimony um they had a wide range of interest and we'll I tried to capture some of that we didn't ever take a um a survey um scientific survey or anything like that but we've just really had a lot of lot of feedback um and there over the years um there's been a strong conent of community members interested in adding natural resource Protections in the urban unincorporated area so we knew that there were a lot of folks interested in this topic and they've continued to Advocate and support greater habitat protection um some of the property owners that we uh we reached out to are supportive natural resource regulations that require retaining and replanting native native trees and many mentioned uh the Oregon white oak or large trees um or improving the wildlife Corridor were feasible in the urban unincorporated areas that was some of the feedb that we've heard um there also were some concerns about our draft Concepts as well um many property owners were concerned that having map resources on their property could affect their property value or future development potential regulations could limit what their currently allowed to do on their property like tree removal or adding on to their home and the development Community comments um they appreciated that the rules were not changing existing processes for sites with riparian wildlife habitat they felt that those were sufficient um but they were uncertain about adding significant habitat that could be regulated which was a change um they were concerned about adding cost for tree inventory or mitigation requirements so moving on to some of the next steps um so we last week uh you heard we've",

        "text": " there there was some changes on that in the proposed order so we do have a a new proposed construction commencement and constru completion deadline um but I can go over that when we get to that section next slide please um great just to give a quick overview of the procedural history for this uh this proceeding uh we got the preliminary request for Amendment one uh in I guess May of last year and uh did our completeness review um got all the additional information that was requested uh on January 30th of this year um the council we issued the prop draft proposed order on February 29th and then held the public hearing on 21st um with a comment period that extended through April 4th um the council reviewed the draft proposed order in the public comments at its meeting last month um and we issued the proposed order shortly after on the 25th of April um the deadline for contested case requests was May 27th and as we mentioned we did receive one timely contested case request um that puts the final decision before you potentially today but first as we mentioned you do need to consider the contested case request and whether or not you will grant a contested case next slide um so generally with the request for Amendment um the council's review um requires the council to consider whether the portion of the facility uh within the area added to the site boundary um complies with all laws and Council standards applicable to an original site certificate application um after considering any changes uh in Factor since the date of the current site certificate was executed the council must consider whether the facility complies with all laws or Council standards applicable um to the original site certificate application so that means any anything that's changed since the council's previous review uh needs to be be considered and reviewed and and then also that the amount of the bond or letter of credit required uh under the financial assurance and retirement standard is adequate um these things cumulatively which are a combination of adding as a result of adding area to the site boundary and requesting a DE de line extension um almost make this a entirely new review although uh the proposed order does include or reference council's previous findings where where appropriate next slide please okay um as I mentioned the public comment period uh was from February 29th to April 4th um the council received four oral comments at the March 21st hearing and you received 20 written comments including 16 comments from members of the public uh three comments from reviewing agencies and then the certificate holders comments on the um on the draft proposed order uh the certificate holder also provided additional responses to the public comments on April 8th next slide please um the comments covered quite a few issues I'll just highlight a few of these since they're mostly relevant to the contested case request but uh several commenters raised concerns about the Wildfire risk assessment and the Wildfire mitigation plan um as well as noxious weed control um there were a number of comments regarding visual impacts of turbines on GLE and be um there were um also the the other comments listed here also say we also received a number of comments of support for the facility um and uh yeah other comments from reviewing agencies asking for kind of technical fixes to some of the condition language we propose I'll go over a lot of this when we go over what the changes were in the proposed order so I I won't go into any of this in more detail but um if anybody does want me to pull up anything or get more information about these comments specifically I'm happy to provide that okay um next slide please okay uh the proposed order did not contain any recommended substantive changes to the um sections shown on this slide as a result I won't be covering them in any more detail um rather than read them all through I guess I'll just pause again and see if any of the council members have any questions about these sections or if you'd like to go over any of the sections or Associated conditions before we get into the sections that do have changes Vice chair Condon thank you Cindy Condon for the record and I'm sorry Chris can you go back to the previous slide for I do have a question about that and it's the the crop loss payments for transmission line um can you talk just a little bit more about that and what I guess um the developer has contract lease contracts with all of the property owners where this transmission line goes through and it what what it are they asking for separate and distinct from a lease payment or what they have agreed to with the developer do do you know that CH chair Conan uh yeah I will do my best to address that memory um so my apologize if I'm not entirely accurate and I am I'll just caveat this with I am paraphrasing but I believe um Mr Myers who spoke last night did raise issues uh suggesting that the council's process should include Provisions for um compensating Farmers for losses of productive land when a transmission line is cited on their land um I believe that the comment um while addressed at this facility was intended to be broader and saying that was a general practice that the council should have and that that the council I think should be looking at the potential agricultural losses on that I I do think that because the issue of financial payment to land owners and the general issue of property rights more generally is really outside of the council's jurisdiction we didn't address that in much detail in the proposed order um but I I hope that somewhat addresses your question it does somewhat and the reason I asked the question is that we're um not able to see the agreements between the developer and the property owners and so um I guess to me it's a it's a request that I don't even see how we would how we would make a determination if we don't have half the story you know we don't know how they're compensated we don't know if there's an agreement that should there be crop loss so um thank you I just wanted to know if there was a little bit more color than what I've understood from the comment and certainly what I've heard about what we know about the agreements themselves um thank you Vice chair Conan yeah and I believe if any other thoughts I might have would kind of be speculation on on both what the intent of the comment is and then you know what the council might consider looking at so um councilor Byer thank you Chris if you can just jump to the next slide that says these are things we're not considering I'm just wondering on the cumulative effect standard for wind since we did receive a comment on that if we do need to revisit the conditions or the Bings on that particular um element and not to suggest that we need to but just know knowing that we received a comment on that making sure that the findings you presented us with are incorporated into the proposed order so just a kind of bookmark on that thank you council member by thank you um I should clarify that for that particular standard we did include some explanatory remarks but we didn't make Subs changes so it ended up on the slide um but since we did receive uh a contested case request that addresses that standard I will be talking about it in the context of the contested case request thank you so you right hearing no other questions thank you see could the next slide okay um so I will just quickly go through the recommended conditions in the proposed order um at council member by mentioned so this is really what's in the proposed order and then there is another request on top of this so none of this will address that request um and I'll go through all that separately um and we're really focused here on amended condition language and I I guess I will copy that throughout the order there are some additional notations or explanatory um findings um kind of walking through what comments were made um how we recommend that the council respond to them uh and how we understood your feedback to be from the April meeting so that is distributed throughout the meeting there throughout the the propos order there's also a table um kind of explaining the comments in more detail as well um okay so uh as I I mentioned with the construction commencement and completion deadlines uh the proposed order does uh include revisions to recommended conditions gen gso1 and gen gso2 um those recommended amended conditions would add new construction commencement and completion deadlines for facility components that would be cited in areas that are uh newly proposed to be added to the site boundary um we thought that was cleaner than trying to add new deadlines for new components the new components will be distributed across both previously approved and newly proposed areas um those deadlines would for commencement would be three years from the date of the council's final decision uh and then three years from the date construction begins um the for the previously approved areas the con the proposed order recommends that the construction completion deadline be um Extended by three years rather than the two that was originally recommended by the department um I think I gave you all pretty thorough enough uh legal explanation of why we reverse that decision but um that's that's there um the proposed order uh makes some modifications to recommended condition pre rfo2 um the revised condition just clarifies the process for adjusting the initial retirement Insurance amount to reflect final facility Divine Design configuration um that was really to address some I think drafting errors uh and just some confusion that we had internally and so this is more of a technical fix than a substantive change made in response to public comments next slide please um the proposed order um makes very I think minor change is to recommended amended condition pre lu3 but it it does make more substantive revisions to the draft noxious weed control plan um those changes clarify the scope of what we expect to be finalized in the um plan including uh treatment and monitoring during construction activities Provisions uh it also requires submitt of a preconstruction uh weed treatment plan um that would be reviewed and approved by the department in consultation with the appropriate we County supervisor um so what that treatment plan would would include is is specific actions uh including uh chemical or or mechanical treatments that would be applied to specific Target weed species um before they do grounds of serving activities to kind of get ahead some of the weed problems that we've seen on other sites um uh and then the condition would also require implementation of that plan prior to ground disturbing activities uh counselor Imes thank you um Katy IMS for the record um in this in your findings um is the weed",

Commissioners with us we do have a quorum thank you first item on the agenda is the director's report Miss ordell Thank You Cher Lockwood my name is Aaron Wardell I'm the planning and development services manager here at Washington County and I have the director's report first of all this is community planning month on October 3rd our Board of Commissioners proclaimed National Community planning month in Washington County since 2006 the American Planning Association has celebrated Community planning month to highlight the role of professional planners and community members as well as the importance of good planning in our communities as we strive for Prosperity Equity balance and cohesiveness planning Commissioners are an integral part of Oregon's land use process and so we appreciate all of you this month is for you as well as for planning staff here at the county so you our next update I'm delighted about we had a successful senior planner Recruitment and one of the people promoted to senior plannner sitting next to me Todd Borowitz so really happy to see Todd move into this new role um Resa far hoodi who is an associate planner in transportation planning has also been promoted to senior planners so really happy to see the two of them continue to advance their careers here at Washington County we have another another senior planner in Transportation Planning and an associate planner in community planning who will be starting soon and so you'll be introduced to them at one of your upcoming meetings tomorrow evening there is a boards and commissions open house here at the Washington Street Conference Center which is just a couple of blocks away from here Cher Lockwood and Todd Borowitz will be there representing the Planning Commission and looking for people who may be interested in applying in case we have upcoming vacancies um this is also an opportunity to recruit for other County boards and commissions so if anyone is interested that's a great time to come by and see what boards and commissions we have available to the community on October 3rd the board held its first hearing on ordinance 897 which would make the comprehensive plan amendments necessary to reflect the River Terrace 2.0 Metro Urban growth boundary expansion the board continued the hearing to November 3rd to consider testimony I also wanted to give you an update that in November it's anticipated that the board will review a draft land acknowledgement statement this is something they've been working on for a number of years they produced this in collaboration with multiple tribes from our area once that is considered by the board we will be providing more information to the Planning Commission about how the board would like to see it implemented for today's Planning Commission meeting you will have a brief work session on our significant natural resources work and then we will hold our first hearing on ordinance number 899 the North Plains Urban growth boundary expansion for your upcoming PC meetings here's what we're anticipating on the agenda for November first which is your day hearing there will be a hearing on a quasi

Hutcherson ol you can go ahead and you will need to unmute yourself on your end and we are not hearing can you hear me yes yes Holly we can hear you go ahead can you hear me okay wonderful thank you um sorry about that uh chair Lockwood and members of the Planning Commission thank you for your time my name is Holly Hutcherson I'm the executive director of the Pacific Northwest CSA Coalition we are a coalition of 100 Farms throughout the state including 10 in and around North Plains in this position I have seen firsthand the challenges farmers face when trying to access farmland and grow food the cost of Farmland is rising and climate change is making farming even more difficult as drought becomes more prolonged and weather extremes more common our farmers are actively researching crops that can stand up to our changing climate it takes agricultural land to do this reducing available Farmland is something that should be examined extremely carefully I applaud North Plains for responding to growth predictions and to Oregon law by examining needed changes to the urban growth boundary however their current plan ignores a few critical issues primary being the loss of efu land the Agricultural and Forest compatibility analysis in their expansion study use only one evaluation criteria I'm I'm sorry to break Forest Holly do I have not reflect the full value of the land under this I'm sorry to interrupt you um you're testifying on a matter that's on agenda um right now this section of the uh agenda is Public Communication for items not on the agenda I've been advised by our Council that if you testify now your remarks will not be included um with the remarks pertaining to uh ordinance 899 so I'm wondering if you would like to just hold your remarks later yes certainly that's fine I'm sorry that that's okay sorry we didn't catch it sooner so is there anyone else who wants to testify remotely we have no other hands raised thank you all right let's let's move on to our work session sign ific natural yes thank you chair Lockwood and Commissioners Teresa chak principal planner with Community planning this will be a very very very brief um presentation maybe the briefest you've ever heard here um uh so we have been working on a limited goal five program update our significant natural resources um focused look at fish and wildlife uh we just wanted to let you know about a couple Outreach opportunities that are coming up um later this week and next um and at your next meeting uh November 1st we'll give you a fuller presentation so this is the the schedule um where we are right now we've been working on our inventory and starting to look at the um economic social environmental and energy analysis um and so both of those items will be the subject of a community Forum which is next week and um an online openhouse which starts on Friday so we would um encourage you and members of the public to participate um either in person or online uh the online openhouse will be um advertised on our website and if you are an interested party and are on our list you will uh receive notification of that the plany commission will receive notification Community Forum uh is next Tuesday and um that's 5 to8 over the Washington Street Conference Center um both will include our draft inventory um so a lot of people have been interested in that we have um sent a letter to uh all of the property owners with um natural resources shown on the inventory and um they will be um uh coming to the meeting uh they also have uh there's a open house that we did specifically uh with an interactive map for the property owners um and we have been Fielding a lot of calls on that so far this week um so um more to come next week but we just wanted to make sure you knew about those in case you wanted to attend thank you um our next our next item is public hearing on ordin 899 and we will start with a staff so good evening chlock wood PC members I'm Todd borkwood senior planner with land juice and transportation thank you um today we'll be reviewing ordinance number 899 the proposed expansion of the North Plains Urban boundary here's an outline line for tonight for tonight's presentation uh I'll provide a brief overview of the North Plains ugb expansion process highlight the policy framework that prescribes what cities and counties must consider for ugb expansions outside of Metro uh describe ordinance 899 recommended provisions and share the staff recommended the St staff recommendation on ordinance number 899 so I want to stress that the County's role in ugb expansions for cities like North plains that are outside of the Metro uh ugb is very limited the county and City must each approve the ugb expansions for an ordinance before the expansion can be approved by the state of of Oregon this is different from the Metro EB expansion process on that let's move on to the slide here's a map of North Plains and its location in the",

        "text": " period oftentimes Council may just receive one staff report of here's an overview of the DPO and the comments received thus far but because we've kind of like been never a little bit longer Council has received three staff reports so one was in preparation of the council meeting last month which went through each of our standards with select facts and those conditions and then we sent one on uh on December 2nd I believe which was an overview of uh comments including the applicant's comments and Department recommendations for how those should be responded to in the proposed order in that staff report and then on December 9 we provided an additional staff report that focused primarily on that on the applicants supplemental uh responses to the DPO comments um and so we're gonna touch on all of those today to try to to button that up button it up okay uh we're gonna start with the Castle's general standard of review the most interesting standard I think I think when we get when Council gets to a uh final decision on this project I I always think that this standard should go last after all of the review of all the standards because this is the standard that it's either the umbrella or the bucket that captures everything it says does this facility um and the applicant comply with all of council's Standards applicable laws and statutes that are applicable to the um so I think that it's a really fascinating standard and functionally in council's final decision it is based off of language from this standard um however underneath the general standard or review section in the draft proposed order um that is where there's uh other conditions that that lift um so there's conditions that are associated the mandatory and set specific conditions um of no general standard of condition one and these are kind of very very typical there's some variation in between projects but these are very typical conditions that Council sees um in the general standard of review section the applicant because because again this is a smaller facility the um represents a a pretty short construction period which would probably be feasible because this is a smaller facility however you know the as the department is aware and and things change in the future and supply and demand and pandemics and wars and gas prices there's a lot of things going on I know that Council has reviewed some other facilities where um access to some resources is is very limited so the department is actually recommending a longer duration of up to 24 months to be able to uh complete the construction just to contemplate some of those some of those changes that may occur general standard of condition general standard review condition three is is one that's really interesting and we've really been trying to focus on lately um it is the condition that requires the certificate holder to design construct and operate and retire the facility substantially as described in the site certificate also in compliance with the council's rules and statutes and paraphrasing and in compliance with all permit requirements from other state agencies so this is and this comes from a mandatory condition but what we've been doing with this is really kind of focusing on the site certificate and making sure that that we describe the facility real well in that description so that we can you know later on if there's a variation in that we can look to it and be like well yes yes or no it substantially as described in this so this is which functionally that site certificate is pulled from the front-end facility description of the final order and then kind of um you know reformatted with a narrative or a table um so that's an interesting aspect but what we also are doing which you'll find in this draft proposed order is we have a section that describes like General construction activities and retirement activities and I feel like those are pretty well done throughout all of council's orders that Council sees because we have a retirement standard where we we unpack that pretty thoroughly of what retirement entails and we really talk a lot about construction underneath a lot of the standards because there's a lot of impacts associated with construction albeit temporary however what we do kind what we are missing a lot of times are these operational components how what are expected operational and maintenance activities and so we really kind of are bolstering on that to give Council the certificate holder and also our compliance program a better idea of what to expect when we go out there in in routine routine checks and maintenances this is also reflected in some of the conditions I'll talk today we're really trying to dial in on having a better understanding of of routine operation maintenance inspections and Reporting um also within the general standard of um lives the uh condition under Oar 3450 260080 and this is the condition that addresses the construction reporting the biannual construction reporting and also the annual reports again we're really trying to dial in on the operational compliance aspect of understanding what's happening out there at the facility and and to us the annual report and like Council has indicated and like councils getting these compliance Updates this it's it's all tied together just basically you don't get you know Constructor facility in the go out on an island and we get a report we're trying to have better information in that report that really highlights things that we should know um so I don't have that condition pulled up here but in the annual report some of the the requirements in rule is a discussion of the facility status reliability and efficiency of power production that's for mostly electric power plants but the status of Surety information monitor reporting the compliance Report with this all all site certificate conditions they have to provide a compliance Report with that and then a facility modification report so those are in that's what's from Rule and what's required and in those annual and then peppered throughout some of the conditions in the order we also tack on you know also hey include this in the annual report that said the annual report and functionally already does that by requiring the compliance with the site certificate conditions but um there are conditions that reroute it basically be sure to provide this information there um and that is the general standard of general standard okay councils uh organizational expertise standard secretary this in terms of the process today so if you have any questions you know want to dig into anything before we go from one to the other you know please ask a question and you know you can deliberate you can wait to the end so I mean it's really this is about you and your process and you know evaluating the draft proposed order and the comments so again wait or you know throughout the specific standards your choice but I just want to make sure you weren't just waiting for the end interrupt me anytime oh and do we have council member shock too oh no I don't know okay okay I forgot to check with him okay but he's not there so I'm not checking with them okay so organizational expertise quickly becoming the second most interesting standard ever thought maybe maybe third I don't know I don't know if you're competing here okay so I'm just going to read it from the rule here so okay so to issue a site certificate the council must find that the applicant has the organizational expertise to construct operate retire the facility in compliance with Council standards and conditions in the site certificate to conclude that the applicant has the expertise the council must find that the applicant has demonstrated the ability to design construct and operate the facility in compliance with site certificate and in a manner that protects public health and safety and has the demonstrated ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous the council may consider the applicant's experience the applicant's access to technical expertise and the applicant's past performance in constructing operating and retiring other facilities including regulatory citations so this is a paraphrase up here but that's just what the first sentence says of the okay so our applicant here is a Project Specific LLC um uh ee e e where is it applicant oh it's a subsidiary okay yeah that sorry I don't actually have the name of the applicant up here but so uh the applicant is a subsidiary of your solar Holdings LLC um and as indicated in the application they have their Articles of Incorporation which demonstrate that they are a uh that the applicant is the sole member and that the uh Project Specific LLC uh has been you know properly development developed or uh in those Articles of Incorporation um the parent company so you're a solar uh has uh experience also in Oregon of developing and operating um several uh different types of energy facilities particularly renewable energy facilities including solar um so that is interesting uh on that note I'm trying to find here like my notes here so and where where we want this to go let me just check because I kind of changed like this just give me a second here as I bumble all right so go back so in the applicant's comments on the DPO they um raised and took issue with the Department's organizational expertise condition five um stating that um the Department's uh recommendation of requiring its contractors compliance history maybe maybe overly burdensome and as indicated in one of the department staff reports the department disagrees with this and and for other projects we do have examples of applicants and certificate holders that have provided this um so uh the department recommends maintaining that um condition okay so may I interrupt you please do just a comment that's something I think we've discussed numerous times throughout multiple um multiple reviews is that especially with the name changes and parent Holdings and this that and the other I think that's just one way that we all can easily look at are they upstanding our name good so I just want to put on America I think that's important to know um that's a good it's a good comment this this comment and I don't uh do I have that condition all the way in front of me I believe that this one was specific to the construction contractor yeah so this is just related to construction whereas I think your comment which I think will be captured more in in this part of the discussion is talking about the the applicant right so if you're if applicant or a parent company changes how do we track that there's still like a reliable good you know good active so I think that this part of the conversation is going to cover that more but that part was just a construction contractor yeah because we want to make sure that you know choosing good construction um which I'm sure they would but not necessarily the lowest bidder but that is up to them so we have that part of that condition so um in uh November uh council member Condon expressed some concerns about the Project Specific LLC the Articles of um and in its responses the applicant you",

        "text": " um Odo is proposing further uh defining this by stating that a partner May assist or take a lead role in the acquisition installation construction or planning of a community renewable energy project that a partner can have a financial or ownership interest in the project um the definition would also clarify that an entity whose only role is the provision of goods or services through a procurement contract would not be considered considered uh a partner that's a consultant contractor role instead um Odo is also proposing that a written agreement be in place between the applicant and any partner before any release of Grant funds under a performance agreement with Odo uh can happen the written agreement would be required to include certain Pro key Provisions from the performance agreement between Odo and the applicant uh Provisions such as the ability for Odo to inspect the project site or audit documentation um so I'll pause there to see if there are any questions regarding any of these potential rule changes while we have them on the screen okay be quiet on here all right I'll on so um as I've mentioned the legislative Amendment providing an additional release of Grant funds for construction projects provided the ability for Odo to establish requirements for the release of funds in rule so as I mentioned earlier the first 30% of grant funding may be released um on entering the performance agreement if the applicant demonstrates having taken meaningful steps to seek to S control um file the request for interconnection with the host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met other requirements that are in the um provided by the department in the agreement um Odo is proposed so that with State the initial 30% and then this um this new Amendment provides the ability for us to distribute an 30% of the grant funds um before the project is kind of fully um complete operational commissioned and all inspections have been taken taken place um and so those the requirements we're looking um at adding in adding in uh that the applicant or partner has fulfilled all the requirements for the release of the first 30% so you couldn't just kind of jump and to the second one you'd have to have completed the first requirements for the first 30% release um the grantee demonstrates they or a partner has incurred a minimum of 25% of projected Grant monies on eligible costs prior to the request for the release of additional funds so um and then also provided an updated budget that details eligible and ineligible costs uh that have been and then the construction or installation of the renewable energy system is has either started at the project location or will start uh no later than 60 days after the submission of the request for that additional 30% of Grant monies and then also there's a requirement that um you would need to start there's a requirement that construction projects start within the first year of the performance agreement so we that that start time would need to be um within that time as well um and then we would go on to kind of say that uh this may be demon like a list of things how this may be demonstrated this may be demonstrated by submitting to the department approval from Authority having jurisdiction for construction of the system to start alongside the supporting documentation um to kind of show that that's going to start like contractor agreements and um and then there's uh just kind of the ability for other requirements in the um performance agreement and then the remaining grant funds is kind of released at the end of the uh construction uh following fulfillment of all the kind of final reporting um requirements uh outlined in the performance agreement are there any questions on these and there there be another opportunity to ask questions provide comments at the end of the presentation well um and so we're also proposing a few other amendments uh there these uh to outline the fixed costs incurred in the normal course of business such as existing staff salaries or overhead would would be considered ineligible for project construction costs um this is already kind of outlined for the case for planning projects we're just kind of uh planning on outlining it for construction Car Projects as well um and then to remove well to allow the ability um for application to be amended during an open opportunity announcement um we have in there there's a line uh that applications aren't can't be amended um this would just kind of allow applications to be amended through um during an open opportunity announcement are there any questions on while we while we have a second um before we get into questions and comments thanks Jennifer for introducing yourself in the chat um for we'd love to know who else is here so if um anyone hasn't introduced themsel in the chat yet and are willing that'd be great I'll turn things back to James to talk about um what's next sure yeah we just want to hear what you think of the proposed rule amendments uh whether they will have um yeah whether you have other suggestions whether there any concerns uh about any of these changes um or any yeah any solutions that you might have to those concerns um if you have questions about anything that we've presented on today or in the program in general as well please ask um as a reminder we're still very early on in the rulemaking process uh I want to GA as much feedback as possible before we enter the comma period on the draft rule language uh you can submit any comments uh or questions by email got the um the program email address up on the screen there community. grants energy. or.gov um if you could submit those by June 7th that would be great uh there'll be another opportunity to provide provide um comments at the end of the June 10th program advisory committee um advisory committee meeting um as well um so yeah just uh ke if anybody has any questions or comments be great to hear people if we don't while people are thinking about their own questions or comments um because really is our our goal is to hear from you for those of you that are on the line that might be interested James could you talk a little bit about what this these changes might mean for um round one and round two projects that have already been um are already in our in the in progress um sure um I think um So currently the agreements in place would kind of uh for those round one and round two um agreements would be uh remain as they are but then these rule changes could um if one of those round one and round two uh projects wanted to request the ability to kind of get th these additional uh payments um they we can amend they have the ability amend the performance agreements to enable the that to to um thank you I don't see any other hands up um or any questions in the chat at this point so we can we we have plenty of time left so we can hang out for a little while and just let people marinate on things yeah and I'm happy to go back um to any of the previous slides um as well I just wanted to clarify so this what I'm gathering from this is this is mostly just um implementing the legislatively adopted um changes and just kind of putting the meat on the bones of what those um legislative Chang es will practically mean for these projects um so there's no like significant policy um changes other than those that had been authorized by the legislature am I summarizing that correctly I mean these were the subjects of legislation I guess is what I'm saying yeah yeah I mean it's an easy one for me to answer to but yeah this is all this Ru making is entirely about um complying with legislation that so it's just kind of a routine I'm I'm gathering just even based on the number of participants it seems like it's a pretty routine um thing so I appreciate hearing about it yeah I think that's true I mean that said we have a rule making open and if we get we don't have the rule making open yet this is like the pre conversation so if there are other things that folks want to bring to the table that we can evaluate this is this is the time to do that before we open that formal R making process I see okay thank you or or it's a nice opportunity to do so so that the formal rule making process isn't extended um by getting those Concepts in the queue first to begin with I see okay thank you so if anyone here has other things in the rules that they have thoughts on we're open to hearing those to but like you said for the most part I think it's pretty routine small crowd and and not a lot of folks having concerns something and also just to reminder if you after today you do have comments feel free to submit them um by email um so yeah we got the the email address on the screen so feel free to kind of send it to the team uh after today as well I think generally speaking James this is where we usually say we'll stick around feel free to go if there's one of you left that wants to chat when there's no one else around or whatever we're happy to to do that um and then we can when end things um after that so share the link yeah and I just yeah put the program link up in case people want to find out more about the program um and there's the program email address again I think that's all the attendees um great yeah great that's very chill I'm wondering to what extent people were confused like me about like having this and the advisory committee so anyway it might be interesting to see if we have people show up at the advisory committee and we might want to consider I think we have public comments on the agenda just in case but yeah thought that was that was part of the that was kind of part of the plan to be able to",

        "text": " a lot greater customer base so their percentage is going to be way lower right so then you have a waiting scale created right there that can be utilized right it'd be like Central Oregon Electric you know again you know same thing or if Warm Springs had a test you know utility here you know same thing 640 000 square acres and five thousand customers yeah yeah you know one one thought is this this idea of scalable projects and what's the sweet spot for going and ask for if we identify it as a scalable project one thing in past programs in although we have had a precedented to come back and say could you take less and make a project work to try to maximize projects and that can be at the front end where we could have a big pool or more likely at the back end where we've identified our top five projects and there's 250 000 left and we could bring in another project and say you ask for poor can you scale it down the 250 and make it work and there's an opportunity at that tail end of awards to recognize scalable projects and bring more in what was a smaller one so bring that up again with a smaller utility so if you don't get grant funding to be able to harden your system what do you then wait for we for a break right and it becomes an emergency so who's more in need of that while a larger utilities it's part of their annual maintenance or their asset based you know maintenance and uh upgrade plan you know because they're able to throw it into the rate base and you know across the whole all their customer base yeah that's an interesting point and if we ask the question would you do this project without the funds if the answer is yes that you lose the grants well the answer is now when we recognize this need but it is the other criteria that I I think that maybe you should at least consider in there is um what has happened in the past and I've seen this in a few of the grand applications and it's probably already been brought up but everybody has experienced Savages and but what is the duration of those packages in the in the areas that you're talking about making it and now realizing that that in some of those instances it might be a five-year time period that these grants is looked at I think you need to expand that a little bit to say how many instances have you had over the last 10 years or what has your cost been in these areas because maybe we haven't had a significant significant number of outages but we we've expended half a million dollars worth of funds going out nice fragrant uh for a 10-year time period um so incidences in that areas are criteria also in there so on incidents is one topic that came up yesterday that I thought would be helpful to revisit with this conversation um is this idea that communities are your um your rate base you know your ratepayers some of them might come to your board meeting some of them may be engaged by being an elected board member but otherwise they don't necessarily care about the joke yesterday was where the fuses are you know right but what they do care about are the outcomes so what are some of those things that your customers care about well they probably care about an outage they probably care um some kind of the duration of an outage maybe um they might care about the cost right are they energy burdened um how much are they already paying are they gonna have to pay more um disconnections things that they're actually feeling the outcome of and so one of the things we talked about yesterday is how to help get an understanding of that in the application process to sort of have that be part of the criteria too um and I'm not sure how much you know different community members are involved in your um sort of structure you know but using your existing kind of network there might be a way to think about it yeah artboard is made up of members which is beneficial on that side and we had a comment from uh Thomas that we can't always base it off outage time because we might want to prevent wildfires in an area with zero outages um which is also a consideration we had one caller uh who um I know has had his hand raised can we unmute them and give them an opportunity to weigh in on us hey this is so just a couple of uh comments maybe so I I heard about the scoring metric for uh you know the rate impact uh for larger territory with lesser customers I think we've got to be just a bit careful in that one because with uh you know with a lot more customers um the other scoring metric could also um you know the risk is higher for you know potentially uh outage impact or Wi-Fi impact for example for a larger customer base as well so there's a flip side to that as well yes there's a rate aspect for the smaller utilities operating in larger areas but there's a risk element that is pretty much a lot more pronounced for um for utilities with a lot larger customer base and also operating in larger area as well so just one comment on that one uh the other one um on the I I heard about the eight hundred thousand dollars being kind of The Sweet Spot um um I I think that that's okay uh but but I think one thing and um you know this was one of the um we had with uh the good deployment office last week in DC was I I think what's happening is and this is one of the reasons why it is so oversubscribed um this whole grip application processes and things because there's a lot of first-timers on this one so there's um an element of um underestimating the level of governance and compliance needed to meet uh or to get these um so there's a there's a very significant effort that needs to be put in you know be they was bacon be it the audit requirements that's needed for every 750 000 plus that you spend on it and you need to get an external auditor most of the times to do a lot of that thesis the invoice requirements so there's a lot of things that goes into it and there's not a lot of information that has been shared till date on that um so so I think when we look at eight hundred thousand dollars uh when we add a lot of that governance compliance or requirements it starts eating into a lot of those benefits that could potentially come in from that you know from the matching doe money as well so uh so I think we need to also consider that particular element uh in into the mix as well maybe that's not something for Odo but maybe for a lot of the participants who will be competing for that is it is it really worth it to go after three hundred thousand dollars worth of you know this program funding when we have to go through a lot of this rigor when it comes to the governance and compliance to get those dollars as well so that's just a couple of thoughts on those two items I just heard on this thank you I actually pose a follow-up question to that even to just put it in the chat if there are others who feel that way the additional technical assistance I know this is a discussion question we would get to if we had more time but just to gauge everyone's kind of if that type of technical assistance and support is useful or helpful I know we did you know share some FAQs obviously that's not as helpful as Hands-On training and kind of working side by side but what is the gauge on that in this room is there a lot of interest in that type of support or do people feel like they feel you know relatively familiar with these whether they like them or not you know uh you know understandable you don't have to like them but do you feel familiar navigating them I would I would turn around and I would say that there's probably a large number of of small utilities that don't understand the impact of of what is going to end up being required because because to the point that was just made now as soon as you're awarded x amount you're going to have a single audit on top of your normal body and and everybody has to be aware of that because it's going to be a requirement to receive the grant funding of that side but I don't think everybody understands completely or the reporting requirements and the ongoing reporting requirements that are going to be out there I don't think uh just small utilities you know the large utilities haven't been eligible for these types of awards ever in the past so you know we are we are learning we're trying to learn really fast what the what the requirements are I mean we've got one one Grant from the federal side of the house in the last many many years right as long as you keep your paperwork up so you can see that's the thing so it's like on the weekly payroll logs and that kind of stuff as long as you get those reported you've got those as back up and then you can furnish those as you know proof of your expenditures and compliance that's the whole thing is compliance you're upset up front and throughout it'll probably get a little bit worse for publicly traded now it's going to be a lot of things for us and just all that to say that yeah we would we would benefit from any kind of technical assistance you know uh that's available I think everybody would yeah and uh Thomas I know I see you you've added there's a need for technical assistance is there anything further you wanted to add on that note sure and we have one more race stand if we can um unmute the the caller that you know we we would uh absolutely um also support uh getting some of the technical assistance as well I mean I can speak for Pacific Corp over the past four years we have received more than 20 million dollars in doe grants for various different you know projects and you know that's kind of my comment was based on the experience that we have had or going through um you know the whole process for a lot of those uh annual Audits and quarterly reports and all those kind of things um certainly at Pacific Court we have sort of at least in some areas we have internally makes made some determination that it might not really be worth going after dollars if it's less than you know X number of uh dollars because uh it's just too onerous to go through that thank you in the interest of time I know we only have a minute or two left so Rob I'll",

        "text": " city of tiger doesn't comply as well truth number two this isn't just planning you don't plan things you don't you plan things you want to build and the backward nature of the policy development on this land use ordinance going from a specific tsp amendment to now a refinement area just gives us the impression that you're hoping that the public lose interest in this and that you'll have to kick the code down Kick the Can down the road when you have to adopt a tsp Amendment down the road uh and you might have additional considerations like climate friendly and Equitable communities rulem which would Place additional pressure on a climate lens for these types of adop option truth number three this project has a cost while it's t talked about in a very hypothetical terms this is a future need because you've already identified a tsp Amendment you've already identified a dollar cost for this project identified at $72 million in 2020 likely to be much higher I've heard rumors that the count is pursuing uh the options for something like a $500 million bond for transportation do you want one fifth of that cost going out for one project at the edge of your Urban growth boundary number four it will hurt Farmland we've lost 30% of our farmland in Washington County between 2012 and 2017 this won't exacerbate that and this isn't do or die a real path to Des exist forward the Mountain Side Way proposal is something you can move forward and we think that by doing that you can actually advance in a vision without necessarily having to do nothing thank you hello I'm here again to ask you to vote no on 882 um because I always feel like the people in rural areas are outnumbered and we rely on you to make the decisions that will benefit us as well as the developed areas in um commissioner F statement she said that um transportation has to be sustainable Equity informed and uh a policy and we don't think that this road is sustainable or Equity informed because I have not seen a single person or heard from a single person in all these years that is in favor of this road um so in the um long range uh work program for 2023 to 25 it has several pages of climate friendly practices and it states that a climate friendly area is an area where residents workers and visitors can meet most of their daily needs without having to drive this seems kind of in congruent with with building a new road through Farmland it is proposed to be a feeder line that is a 20 M an hour slow go I don't know of any road that has been developed that is that Erin wadell in 2021 mentions that the tile Flat Road Extension is expected to have a higher cost than the Baseline Alternatives it offers little evidence that it will truly solve the issues and will cost a fortune we are asking you as everyone has through all this time speaking to you that you hear the people in the rural areas and consider us thank you you all right as the last of our sign ups was there anyone that wish to testify on this ordinance okay please please come forward Rich vile and then follow that please come forward and after this we will move to the online testimony Madam chair go ahead Mr vile thank you madam chair members of board I often don't find myself in agreement with some of the folks that are here as you probably know I have been an advocate for increasing the amount of uh rubber tire access roads that we have here in the county uh as the chair of the Planning Commission back in 2017 I worked to get an amendment to the tsp that would require us to look at a real solution to the north south uh problems that we have right now particularly inter Urban we've got Sherwood U working in Hillsboro and vice versa and we have not got the roads that are necessary to take care of that this particular proposal would be I think uh problematic more than just kicking the can down the road it exacerbates an existing problem we bought our first Farm on schul Fury Road in 1986 of 24 Acres we've now grown as a family to about 250 Acres on five farms in the scholes area our primary crop is table grapes which serve the school districts we we provide school lunch grapes to all the area school districts I can't get them out and the problem is is because whether it's a grabhorn or 175th or any of those roads around there that go up into the uh Beaverton School District area we're not able to get get the grapes up there because those Farm to Market roads have now been taken over by the commuters this tile flat extension would simply add more traffic to grab horn that's already there I urge you not to Kick the Can Down the Road Again by working on this one and go back and look at the real problem and look at a true north south uh limited access Highway which this West Side needs thank you thank you Mr Stone sorry that's fine no worries yes good evening chair Harrington and Commissioners my name is Aaron Nichols I live at 11,000 Northwest Jackson Quarry Road Hillsboro Oregon I farm next door I want to address you tonight on behalf of Farmland first a countywide organization protecting farmland and agricultural communities that keep the county strong now we'll continue to keep it vital in the future as you consider the extension of tle Flat Road I ask you to consider it in a larger countywide context of decisions that have hurt our agricultural communities paved over our Farmland made us a less resilient Community as we Face the effects of climate change in the last 5 years we have data for Washington County lost 23% of its Farmland but to keep this both local And Timely we can look at just the attempts to pave over Washington County Farmland this year I'm sure it's not a comprehensive list I've testified against more than 1,700 Acres being added to hillsbor through legislative suiting in January 855 acres of land being added to North Plains through GB expansion plan the dlcd said relied on incorrect facts starting in May 200 Acres of urban Reserve Farmland being added to Hillsboro's Ira at a potential cost of $370 million in September and now an unnecessary and very expensive Road expans expansion that will further paralize and break up Farmland in the south of the county even though many of these schemes have already failed and others will soon um each attempt raises the price of farmland and harms our farm communities um as speculators move in and Farmers facing increasing burdens and decreasing opportunities move out there are a lot of things that I and I think all of us here don't know about ordinance 882 in the context of Paving over the lands that'll feed us in the future I don't know if this is the ordinance that pushes farmers in the productive southern part of the county out of farming um I and one of the reasons I don't know this and the reason you'll have to make these decisions in the dark is because we don't have the data or the maps of where our critical Farmland is we don't know or support the shared infrastructure that keeps it working and we repeatedly choose to harm our farm communities and destroy our Farmland despite that ignorance there's something I do know about ordinance 882 and other expensive and unnecessary development of high value farmlands we're uh paying large sums for projects to exacerbate climate change reduce our resilience leave our children in a duded and less fertile world I ask before you consider moving on with ordinance 882 get the data and understand what the long-term consequences are to our farms and our future resilience so we can eyes open make the choice between an expensive and unwanted Road and our future Feud security thank you thank you right last one in the room is miky Blizzard I apologize for getting your last name wrong I was starting to articulate the name of your farm good evening chair Commissioners thanks for the opportunity to testify my name is mcki Blizzard I live in unincorporated Washington County and first of all I would like to acknowledge and congratulate everybody who has shown up testified added their signatures to their concerns about ordinance 82 and I want them all to know that regardless of how the vote goes you are making a difference and I congratulate your involvement in this issue it's hard to believe that nearly 35 years ago I sat at this very spot urging the commission to adopt lot Trak instead of a western bypass and lot Trak of course was the the land use alternative of mixed uses served by transit and walkable communities designed so people wouldn't have to drive long distances and had the county and the local jurisdictions followed through on those recommendations we probably would not be here today instead what we're having is more of the same the proposal for more roads would which creates more traffic which creates more emissions which devastates farmlands wetlands and moves us further down the devastating Road of climate change uh we that hasn't worked in 75 years and I don't know why why one more road is going to solve the problem you have you know and I believe you know that as well as I do you have good staff here they know how to plan engineer and build but they're being directed to move us toward a the wrong future and 75 years has proven that I ask you to direct them to a better future we know how to do this we had the technology we had the creativity to do this and this is a good opportunity to make a better future happen for us all thank you all right we'll move to online first up I have Don Hornish Don can you hear us I hear you yep please go ahead for up to two minutes well um thanks for letting me join virtually and I man hearing all these testimonies are it's inspiring um nice job I uh I'm I'm a fifth generation Oregonian and this is painful watching this whole process um I agree with everybody who spoke prior to me I Echo all of their concerns in in in addition to just the fiscal responsibility that the county has in making a decision to put this road in is wrong um right now there's two other projects that are having funding issues that are trying to support some of the mega subdivisions that are being put in one of them widening schols fairy to four lane road between Roy Rogers and tile flat it's stuck right now it's having funding issues that particular Project's only million the other project",

        "text": " through the slides and we are available for questions thank you Mira good morning uh good afternoon Jerry it's usually warnings in the work session good afternoon cherrington time shifting I know um as Mir mentioned my name is Tom Eggleston and I'm this always recycling division manager and I use key him pronouns so we are here for recycle Plus update it has been 10 months since your board adopted uh revisions to our solid waste recycling administrative rules that launched an additional recycling collection service which has since been coined recycled plus so let's get into just an overview of the update here we're gonna start with a quick reminder about our solid waste collection system it's a complex system and it's good to frame this conversation in those reminders we'll dig into recycle plus we'll talk about the background some promotional efforts over the last 10 months participation and materials we'll also look at Community member feedback and improvements that we've built into the program based on the feedback and then a quick glance at what might be coming next so reminders about our Solid Waste collections I'm not trying to keep up with my notes I always write notes and I um Washington County I think the first thing for us all to remember is we're the Solid Waste Authority of the unincorporated areas of the county that includes both Urban unincorporated and Rural unincorporated we use the Metropolitan Service District to identify the difference between urban and rural we have about 60 000 residential household customers in urban and about 6 000 in rural county maintains a franchise system to regulate solid waste collection this is very similar to other utility type services such as electricity or water and franchise systems operate through the granting of exclusive rights to a certain geographic area and in this case we Grant those exclusive rights to private companies that operate on behalf of the county in those franchised areas franchise models allow us to do many things and some of the important benefits of the franchise model as it ensures that we can provide equal access to these essential utility services to our community members we can ensure that there's regulatory safeguards in place so that our providers are operating above board and doing everything that they should be doing and we regulate rates because there's no Market competition the county sets rates those rates are set in an open transparent process we're going to be talking about that here in the next couple months for this year and it also aligns with our Regulatory and our not regulatory our 2030 Solid Waste or Regional waste plan I'm sorry a lot of regions and wastelands the regional waste plan is a vision for how the solid waste system should operate in 2030 it was organized by Metro in collaboration with local governments and it is based on a foundation of a strong regulatory oversight by governments and Regional Partners on how we manage the system recycle us so as you may recall recycle plus was adopted in April of 2022. through resolution in order 2244 it's been 10 months now well 10 months since it started almost a year since we adopted it oh yeah it started in July right July 1. yeah um it's a it was a new service it's an optional service customers don't have to take it it's an option to them it's an on-call service so it's only service to when customers need it to be serviced and it launched on July 1st of 2022 in the unincorporated areas of the Urban unincorporated the the recycle plus program offers recycling opportunities for things that are not included in our curbside standard recycling carts and those include plastic bags and stretchy film plastic number one clamshell containers textiles and compact fluorescent light and the resolution in order also adjusted the standard curbside recycling program to include batteries in the glass recycling bin as you remember and that is available to all customers in unincorporated urban and rural efforts for the recycle plus program we launched this program and we heard a lot of people that said we've never heard anything about it so you need to do a better job promoting it so we took that to heart and we worked hard with our franchise collector Partners we developed a postcard there's an image up here send it to every eligible household in the county received a really large uptake from that postcard effort our franchise providers have developed web campaigns social media advertisements that you can see pictures of here developed web pages some earned media we have had actually a local blogger who blogs on sustainable packaging find out about the recycle plus program and blogged about it on his blog and we've he asked to call out to anyone at Waste Management that wants to come on his blog and talk about it and I made sure that they got connected so they can go talk about it on his blog as well so we're working hard on the promotional efforts the brand is coming together the purple color is part of the brand that we intentionally put together the recycle plus logo I will share that Washington County paved the way with this program and many local government Partners across the region are starting to join us this data is specific to unincorporated so I won't confuse that here but the brand is carrying through which I think is really important it's purple bins it's recycle plus and it's the same materials up to this point so we're starting to see it grow in in the community and particularly on the west program participation you can see there that we had that huge jump in August of 2022 that was I think a direct correlation from the mailer we sent out to eligible households we've got over 500 in that one month we've continued to see growth since that time we are estimating we're about 1140 today uh customers were seen 50 or so a month continue to sign up over the last couple months and we're going to continue to work on it we're now integrating recycle plus into our standard materials making sure that it's notified that it's an option in our newsletters in our recycling guides that it's an add-on option for customers so as it gets integrated into other cities in the county too I think it'll become more of a mainstream option that people become aware of awareness I think is the biggest thing right now we're still working through to make sure folks know about it uh some stats on the materials collected I always like to put this disclaimer out on materials collected when we're talking about garbage and recycling we use weight in the solid waste industry and weight is a good metric but it things way differently versus the volume they take up so when you think about weight on this slide in particular there's two items that probably occupy both extremes of that plastic bags and stretchy film are just about the bulkiest lightest thing except for expanded styrofoam um and so 3 000 pounds of plastic bags is not look the same as three thousand pounds of batteries batteries are very heavy item they're small and dense and and are very heavy so just thinking the weight it doesn't you can't say oh my gosh that looks like so much more in the batteries column It Is by weight but by volume it's a very different way to think picture it so these are figures that we've gotten from our two um collectors or processors right now most of the material is going through Far West recycling Pride recycling also has a transfer station in Sherwood and they are processing and managing and marketing most of their materials on their own at their facility as well so these are the combined numbers estimated to be for the unincorporated portions of the recycle plus subscribers so about three thousand pounds of plastic bags in film that material is going to track stacking and turning into composite decking lumber plastic clam shells about 3 100 pounds so far and that material is going through a company called D6 and then ending up at Green impact Plastics and it's being recycled back into recycled poly pet I'm not going to try to say it polyethylene Tetra Hyde I think something like that and that's going back into Berry containers um there's a really close partnership with the berry Cooperative in the central California Valley with this recycling process um textiles about 1600 pounds of them they're going to Pioneer wipe and cloth in the company in Portland that makes absorbent Rags with them and they try to recover what they can for reuse compact fluorescent light bulbs looks like a small number it is and I anticipate that number will continue to get smaller because they are phasing out of our system we actually saw Bill in the legislature this session that would aband compact fluorescent light bulbs from our store shelves they contain small amounts of mercury and LED lights are lasting longer and much more sustainable as well these materials were really being captured to make sure that mercury doesn't end up in the solid waste system in the landfills and in our coverage trucks that stuff is going through Universal recycling Technologies they reclaim the small metal bits and and safely handle the the Mercury disposal household batteries 16 000 pounds which is a pretty awesome figure when you add up all the batteries collected by our West Side communities we're at something like 13 tons which is getting up there to 26 000 pounds so as we're talking about a lot of batteries that are coming out of the system and those are also going to Universal recycling Technologies um shredded separated from potentially hazardous components and the metal is reclaimed from those before we move off to slide could I interrupt uh it's really wonderful to hear about the End Market how much of that end Market development did you and other partners have to work on in order to put the recycle plus program together most of these end markets were there they they've existed they're difficult to access they have very stringent quality requirements um plastic bags and film is a great example they're almost a zero tolerance for moisture um wet bags don't go into their system and you'll that's the main reason it has to be a lid on the recycle plus bin and the lid has to be secured so collecting that at the curb has been really challenging we can't put it in the regular bin because it gums up the recycling facility so we have to separate it we have to keep it dry they do have historically taken the film from grocery stores at the take back in front of the store for plastic bags so trekka's Trex is a strong Market their facilities in Reno Nevada they do lots of drives for film they partner with school districts and do plastic film drives so it's a mature Market it's just very picky and we have to have really unique practices and processes",

        "text": " with a a plan that works faster than slower um in terms of the budget I I hear from so many that are unsettled about how the city is spending and how much money there is when that first budget book dropped down in front of me a year ago 460 Pages $757 million and in 30 minutes over a cup of coffee with a girlfriend she found a error so what else is in the book and what's being done and what's not the budget needs a real examination and I will figure out how to do that in the best most efficient and affordable way homelessness Public Safety tell you what when people don't feel safe bad things happen it's not just the people committing the bad acts it's the unsettled feeling inside of a community that creates more problems our law enforcement and fire deserve our support and they deserve to be funded first okay Julie next question you'll begin a key asset for a public leader is to change a position on an issue after learning new information thinking of your public service can you describe one time when you changed your position on a city ma matter and how that came about H that's a really good question thank you H I didn't change my mind about the tax I maybe felt a little light on the L library because it felt like an extra and then when I saw the outpouring of the community and how much it means to them I realized we need to find a way to do this okay thanks great yes I would say commercial passenger air service I wasn't convinced initially that it would be viable I wasn't convinced uh that we were ready for that and after many meetings many conversations I changed my mind and that's when I got behind it and supported it and we made it happen can I follow up with that yeah so just to follow up on that Chris um you changed your mind on that but it was through meetings what was it that you heard word that changed your mind I learned more about why it failed the first time and I thought I had the impression I think a lot of people have the impression that it was because the community didn't support it but really we had a bad model we had Regional Air Service back then with 50 passenger planes the price of fuel went up astronomically and 50 passenger uh airplanes were no longer economically viable for anybody that's why you don't really see them in service anywhere not just saling and so when I learned that this model was going to be with 737s and 150 passengers and they were economically viable that's when I started to change my mind I realized okay this wasn't about community support this was about economics thank you and Chris the City of Salem in 2020 adopted a climate action plan to reduce emissions increase climate resilience and increase Equity once the last time you reviewed the plan and What place would it have in your next term well I'm the chair of the climate action plan implementation committee so I would say the last time I reviewed it was our last meeting uh a couple weeks ago um we are working hard to implement as many of the things that we can we've done uh a number of things to help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions uh We've increased the possibility of denser housing in our around the core uh Transit Network we've allowed for taller buildings smaller setbacks to try to incentivize the building of houses and near the The Core Transit Network that's been one of the huge things we've done we've created a micro grid out of our public works department where we actually have uh solar panels and battery storage so we can actually um actually help that entire neighborhood out where our Public Works building is operate in case of an emergency and all through solar um we have solar panels on a number of City buildings we use biodiesel in our entire fleet wherever in all of our diesel vehicles uh there are a number of have issu there's over 200 uh initiatives that we're working on uh and we're trying to prioritize those and things that we can do things that we can afford to do things that we have the staff capacity to do thank you Julie what role would the climate action plan have in your Administration it's not going to come as any surprise really but I have a lot to learn about that it is something that I care about deeply and it's been laughed about but I was the only member of the Ranger Rick nature Club in grade school and I cared very much about leaving the playground better for the person who came behind me when I left it I do feel very strongly about leaving this Earth better than we found it our our priorities in that realm for me right now I I've been honestly too busy trying to survive in business in Salem Oregon than to worry about that a lot of folks uh have that kind of time to spare and I want to learn I want to know why it matters and I want to be able to be helpful but I want to solve this crisis that we're having and I want to rebuild trust in the community for our city government well let me pose a followup on that because it is an important issue to a lot of people in this community what what we didn't hear from either of you is when if you take offices May or in January how important is the climate action plan going to be in your Administration for me it's very important we have a a new climate action plan manager uh it's it's very important that we maintain that work we we we provide our leadership as a city government and uh for our community and do all we can to try to help reduce our impact on the on the really how important it's certainly important and I want to learn from the people who know a whole lot more than I do about this particular topic and how we can best serve the community as a city government in this regard okay thank you Julie next question for you the city's medic system is in distress with poor response times the city police force says it's far under staff to protect Salem in your time already in Salem City office What specifically have you proposed to address these Community safety matters and please don't make it all about money what have I done specifically to address matters proposed proposed what if I proposed and it can't be about funding Public Safety First that can be part of it but just so long as that's not the only okay funding Public Safety First showing support proposed do you mean in a council meeting is that what you're getting at think of it as would propose even okay greater support for law enforcement and fire getting to the root of our most serious issues right now to reduce their workload if we deal at the root of the problem I was asked this question by firefighters would you want us to have more to work with or would you want us to get by on what we have and I came up with a question and that was if you weren't dealing with the those suffering from addiction and mental illness on our streets how much less work would you have and the response was if you just took station one the workload would be reduced by 50% I want to help in any way I can to ease the load not only for police and fire but for our hospital system which is facing this every day all day long people coming and coming and coming and no way to really help them that's right okay just a follow up just because medic system was in the question any proposals there just on the medic system well we just came through the big change right the uh fire department is now taking over that service from faal ambulance and it's it's hopefully going to reduce the amount of overtime that's been incurred by Faulk not being able to cover that um and hopefully they'll be able to get there faster and have enough people working in the jobs to cover all the shifts thank you and Chris now to you would you like me to read it I would the city's medic system is in distress with poor response times the city police force says it's far underst staffed to protect Salem in your time already in Salem City office office What specifically have you proposed or would you propose to address these Community safety matters thank you uh well since I've been on city council when I first got onto city council two of our fire stations were closed I led the effort to reopen both of them and we successfully reopened them one in West Salem and one out on the Shema campus uh two I believe it was two years ago or three years ago uh councelor Phillips and I worked to uh to propose six new police officer positions for to so the chief could reorganize the department in a sort of a community policing framework uh and I was proud to to support that along with my colleague counselor Phillips so those are two things that I have done we also um uh created the SOS team which is a which is two well and then there's the the police part of that which is uh two police officers who liaz with our homeless camps they go out and build rapport with uh with people who are experiencing homelessness they work with them to try to help them get out of that situation uh so those are those are two of the things I've done so far um and I fully supported the shift uh uh bringing the EMS uh service back into the city I think that anytime you have people's lives at stake that uh and then and you try to Overlay a profit margin on top of that that's a that's a that's FR with problems and I I support uh Public Service employees doing that work let's stick with that subject for just a moment because Public Safety both of you rank that as a very high uh priority for for your offices share with the audience how much political Capital are you willing to spend in the next term to ensure that fire and police services are protected even if that requires getting more Revenue Julie start with you how much more capital I would I would be guessing at that how I don't know how to answer that question it's not that I don't know who to call to find out how much Capital do we have and where are we going to get it from and what's it going to do who's it going to pay for those are all really valid questions is it m yeah okay well thank you for the question Les and I'm just going to repeat a line that my opponent likes to use I supported the payroll tax and that was a lot of political Capital that I expended because I wanted to support police and fire it was a huge amount I knew that it would",

        "text": " to pause to see if there are any questions um on everything that's been presented up to now hi Edith I do have a question from bill um he's interested in how local community opposition to Renewables or new transmission systems might be figured into the analysis yeah that's a really good question and it's a difficult question to answer answer right now um at the beginning of this work but I'll say that this is one of the reasons that we are working on an energy strategy because we want to hear we we want to we want to hear from you how you view some of these challenges and some of the issues that are that are coming up in that opposition and to um understand how this analysis could speak to that um and there may be places where there are limits on how much we can do in the technical modeling but I'll I'll just remind everyone that there'll be a policy discussion next year and I think some of these things will more easily be addressed when we talk about policy gaps and policy opportunities but and we're also we're also following I should mention the the solar um rules advisory committee right now um who are doing some important work on this point so we're we're very much paying attention to that too and I don't have any more questions but I will just flag for folks again if you do have a question please um add it to the Q&amp;A I'm keeping a close eye on it and can relay them to um Edith as we go along and uh Bill thanked you for your answer by the way Edith um and if you don't know how to see your Q&amp;A look at the bottom right hand side of your screen and there's a circle with a question mark inside a box there and if you click on that your Q&amp;A should pop up um and other than that I don't see anything else having come in the chat okay thanks Jessica if you think of questions that you didn't ask now there's still a chance at the end so it's not too late all right so um now I'd like to turn to engagement opportunities since this is I don't know I I'm thinking of this as the fun part this is where we all get to like roll up our sleeves and and talk about um what Oregon's kind of needs and and and opportunities and what sorts of solutions we can work on together so um as with the technical work I'm really happy to say that um we are um getting ready to bring on board a facilitator who has um like with our um technical consultants CLE the clean energy transitions Institute um KS and West were chosen through a competitive procurement process and we're thrilled to be working with them we're just bringing them on board as I said so I'd like to cave out everything I'm going to say today by um we still have to work out the details um and so um I really encourage people and you might hear this a few times today to sign up if you're not already signed up for email updates to check our website um because now that we are bringing Kern and west on board we anticipate uh things moving moving pretty quickly and having more information for you shortly oops sorry I meant to speak to this slide okay um so first of all we have three kind of structures in mind three groups in mind for the energy strategy and for anybody who is there for the November webinar this remains unchanged so we have um an inter agency Steering group that's already been formed um that that uh serves to ensure state agency coordination um and this group includes us it includes uh the department of land conservation and development the Department of Transportation the Public Utility Commission uh Department of Environmental Quality business Oregon and the governor's office and other um agencies um who are also invited to share their expertise especially now that we are going to um get moving with things and this group meets about once a month um we also um have an Advisory Group that we have not yet formed and that we envision serving as a sounding board for the energy strategy process and so the idea for The Advisory Group is that it would be composed of people with diverse perspectives from across Oregon so we would have all of those perspectives in one room meeting once a month to both get an update on the energy strategy but to talk through um difficult questions ask uh ask us questions um and help guide and inform the process and then we also um have um plan to pull together working groups and the working groups will serve to really get in the weeds so these are um people interested in discussing Technical and modeling aspects of the energy strategy um and when I say um technical it doesn't just mean looking at um uh there there different there are all sorts of technical expertise and for example we want to make sure that when we're talking about um transmission and Distribution Systems and we're talking about um uh fuel supply that there's an opportunity also for um people who bring a community perspective to also engage in those conversations uh and this this um these groups are we we anticipate seven to eight working groups I'll talk a little bit more about this in a moment and they will be meeting um through July and August roughly uh to inform the technical analysis so we envision more than one meeting for a working group we oh Jessica knew there'd be questions right off the bat here well these are um they're they're not exactly related to what you just want over but I thought this was a good opportunity to jump in um and the first one actually I'll I will answer um I'll give Edith the chance to take a breath and uh sip of water uh I did get a question from Ron about how in depth the employment impacts will be and will they disaggregate impacts based on occupation classification wages demand or displacement needed training Etc um so ROM we understand that there's a lot to the energy jobs component of all of this and right now we're looking into options um to sort of add to what the what's within the scope of this existing energy strategy um we don't have like anything to share right at the moment but I do think that there's definitely some need to dive a little bit deeper into some of the questions around that that might not be able to be addressed within the budget and time frame of this particular analysis and the second question is from Peter uh Peter asked if distributed generation at the residential level including solar and batteries or other renewable local distributed generation strategies would be considered in the model to achieve resilience and climate goals um and I think that's precisely the kind of thing that we're hoping to hear from people in the um in the coming months as we're out engaging what things are you interested in the model trying to address what energy questions do you have so um uh I'll I'll hand it back over to Edith to see if there's anything she wants to add but in general um these kinds of questions are are exactly the kind of information that we're looking for uh at this time yeah thanks Jessica into that question on distributed resources I'll I'll just add that um we will be looking at um we'll be kind of evaluating all resources including distributed resources in the analysis and then when you mentioned resilience impact you know that speaks to the kind of thing that we we as Jessica said really want to hear about which is um how we can start thinking about the co- benefits of certain measures and if there is a resiliency benefit how do we consider that in the model so I think it's um really good question something that um we are excited to dig into so um we also plan to consult with tribes um because this is government toover engagement it's on a separate um slide here and it's on a separate track with each of the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon um this obviously doesn't mean to preclude um tribal council or members from particip ating in any other meetings that would be fantastic but we also plan to undertake this formal government toover engagement and to engage with tribal communities and organizations um where appropriate whenever appropriate so um we also have in mind these three kinds of meetings in addition to the um the groups that I mentioned above which are more established structures so there's there's a difference here the groups that I mentioned before the inter agency Steering group The Working groups The Advisory Group they require a bigger time commitment and they have kind of an ongoing series of meetings um and so what we want to present here are one-time meetings um most likely um that are meant to enable um really us to hear from a really broad range of oregonians on their priorities their um questions and thoughts about the energy strategy so the first uh type of meeting that we have in mind are listening sessions and as you can see we've tried to boil down the force bullet to like what purpose does this session serve and here it's tell us what you think so we plan to take listening session that title seriously be in listening mode schedule a few meetings so everyone can find a time that works for them and really sit back and listen and try to understand um where folks are coming from and uh and and that will be really important to us in in thinking about how we shape the energy strategy we also um realize that um we may need additional meetings with additional groups on specific topics listening sessions alone might not be enough and so what we mean by organizational meetings here is really extra meetings to deepen our um but not to the level of detail of the working group so this isn't like getting into the Weeds on the modeling getting into the Weeds on data sources and assumptions but it is getting to the heart of uh priorities of concerns so for example we see the need for a meeting with environmental justice and Equity organizations and a listening session is probably not enough to really dig into some of the priorities and concerns and and um and key questions for EJ and Equity organizations so we would organize an organizational meeting to have that discussion and the the details of this is are something that we'll develop with Kerns and West over the coming weeks and then uh you all are joining a webinar today and we anticipate holding more webinars probably one to two more this year and they serve really to get updates um or to provide updates on the energy strategy and to get a sense of what's coming next so I'm going to try to summarize all of what I just said on one slide and we'll see how it goes so um how will these groups work and what's the difference so here's another go at that um so I'm just going to focus here on the timeline for this year",

        "text": " benefits and uses for this area all of which are supported by this proposed amendment third is the existing North Hillsborough Urban rural plan so we have taken the approach to really build above and beyond the existing plan and so you'll see the draft plan and report that are in front of you takes what we adopted in 2015 in partnership with the county in release seeks to enhance and build off of that and call those pieces out and then lastly all the steps that we are taking are within the parameters but also guided and regulated by Oregon revised Statute and I'll talk just a bit more about that at the end of the presentation this morning I will not give the in-depth Ted Talk version of tax increment financing 101 but I'm happy to answer any questions on this but suffice it to say that we have evaluated both from a community benefit standpoint but as well as alignment with state law and the provisions of urban renewal law and state of Oregon and we are fully intending to continue to build upon the Frozen tax base that is that area that is secured where existing taxing districts will continue to receive that tax benefit from this area and we also are seeking to amend the plan for the proposed and projected tax revenue increase the light blue area for how we would seek to maximize the public benefit and policy realization of our land use policies in this area while also trying to do so in as quickly and efficiently as a manner as possible we heard the Commissioners in particular you chair Harrington loud and clear in early August our city council and our Planning Commission as well as some of our executive leadership team have provide similar desires and direction and we believe based on the trajectory that this district has been on to this point as well as what lies ahead we'll continue to do that we also will continue to keep an eye on the somewhat recently changes to state law that also would trigger Revenue sharing back across the taxing districts when we Eclipse that threshold within the district which still appears to be at least a few years out the existing plan District you've seen this as much of the community but is outlined in red here this is intentionally put over the aerial photo in 2015 to show what the area looked like the primary purposes of the original adoption the plan which remain largely similar to what we're evaluating in this amendment is to promote recruitment development and service of critical industrial sites for a variety of Target industries of all different sizes to assist in the provision of adequate public infrastructure we've done that again both with city of Hillsborough infrastructure projects we've also done it with some significant and beneficial partnering with peer agencies such as clean water services and others and then lastly is to promote and support environmental stewardship that too was contained within our communities 2035 plan in our comprehensive plan and there are significant portions of this district and the proposed amendments that would help us enhance the wible creek corridors the city's vision of the Crescent Park Greenway as well and bring environmental benefit and enhancement too much of the area this slide summarizes the existing District which is to the left from a numerical standpoint and then the proposed amended District to the right I will note that these are not to be summed together the right side is reflecting the proposed amendment so you should not be adding numbers across here so the original District in 2015 just as a refresher was just shy of 2 000 acres in size 1090 Acres we are proposing to increase at about 192 acres in total with the amendment for a total resulting District of 1282 Acres similarly the project costs that were estimated in 2015 were at 197 million in the proposed amendment before you that has increased to 370 million the reasons for that increase are twofold one is that we have increased and added additional projects into the proposed plan as a result of encapsulating some of the Jackson East areas and we have also refreshed the projects that were in the original 2015 plan to reflect for some significant cost escalation or projections that we've seen especially given the inflationary environment that we've been in over the last six or seven years the forecasted 25-year tax increment period as you'll see reflected in the plan in the report is 25 years from the original 2015 start date so that one does get a little confusing here we have done that largely uh in an effort to try to be responsive to you all as our partners in this work uh and in the recognition that one of the goals here is to build and contribute to not just the city's tax base but also the County's tax base in this area the sooner we can sunset this District effectively and efficiently the sooner we can receive the general fund and tax benefit of hopefully the Investments that occur in this area I do want to just clarify while we're targeting a 25-year Tiff closeout which would put us collectively in the fiscal year 2040 24 to 1 year that closeout is still subject to the types and nature of projects that we undertake in the district and what the status of any debt is in at that time because we do have to close out and satisfy any debt obligations in order to fully uh and effectively close this District out uh just uh bear with me as I I try to knock out the final two points on this side and we'll keep moving but the projected revenues for this area in 2015 were just over 290 million we used data uh that we will show here in a minute over the last six years of recent activity in this area that significantly overshot those projections and while we still try to bring a fairly conservative low uh estimation into this we did feel it appropriate to reflect that Revenue Trend in this area because we believe it is reasonable to think that it can continue to a degree and so you'll see the revenue increases also increased to about 332 million we always evaluate two revenues don't have to fully cover project costs but we do like to see those two numbers generally close so that way if we are taking on projects we do have the anticipated Revenue to be able to cover those projects in any Debt Service associated with them and lastly and probably most significantly when we're using this tax increment tool is the maximum indebtedness this is the most debt that the district can take out for the eligible projects that are contained under the projects and the project costs bullet on this slide that maximum debtedness per required methodology as you can see has increased in the amendment from 172 million to just over 268 million across the top just some fun pictures because this isn't work about numbers it also doesn't work just around tax basis this is our community this is the physical manifase manifestation that Community it is our consideration of the trade-offs of converting the precious rural areas that you've even heard in some of the other testimony in your meeting this afternoon to meet other community needs in a perhaps similar but different fashion and it also shows how effective with our Partnerships across agencies and with this tool we can be between delivering public infrastructure projects like Star Boulevard or Huffman Road as you see in the left two pro pictures as well as the pump station site and the future 30th Avenue quarter that kind of runs up to top to bottom in the right side picture that incised irrigation ditch is Weibel Creek there that has been farmed right up to its Brink that will be supplanted with our Crescent Park Greenway Corridor which we've already planted over uh thousands of trees and and shrubs in that area to start to bring back habitat and environmental function as well as hopefully future recreational benefit in that area using this District so why consider expanding the boundary and amending the plan it's to continue some of those pieces I noted a few moments ago maximize the sustainable economic output of this urbanization and of this area of not just the city but of the county achieve and really maximize the land use and economic development objectives of this area as is contemplated by the Oregon land use system and encouraged by it as was contemplated when this area was brought into the urban growth boundary and as has also been contemplated in our conference of planning work for this area support the delivery in paying for infrastructure again this tool enhances our ability to not only engage in public Public Partnerships with other agencies but has also facilitated tremendous public-private Partnerships also into this area as is noted by the bottom photo in that picture where we put in the core backbone just the travel Lanes of the road the water sewer lines in the in the road and you can see Hitachi in their project came in and built out these cycle tracks the sidewalks the street lights the street trees and the storm water facilities with that helping us to achieve our multimodal and some of our sustainability in Urban Tree canopy goals as well so areas of consideration for the expansion the green area is back to that map that you saw early on that's the existing District that is going unchanged it's the yellow area in the upper left which we refer to as Jackson East North is the geographic area for also within the parameters of state law we are proposing to cap the maximum indebtedness and the geographic size at 20 we cannot go larger than that uh even if we sought to cover the total acreages um eligible projects uh this is one that really goes back to show what are these funds going to be used for and why is this a public uh decision that is in order for projects to receive or be eligible to receive public tax increment dollars they have to be included in our plan and they have to be have a cost estimate put to them that's why you see the 370 million dollars and you can see generally at the top of this slide how we have broken out those different types of projects ranging from Transportation projects which account for almost 40 percent other public utility projects these are hard assets hard Investments that will go into our communities and serve these areas together those equate to about 80 percent then you see other also very key areas but of lower percentages things like the trail and open space that I mentioned a moment ago natural resource enhancement and sustainability related projects public buildings and Facilities Technical and financial assistance Etc I will note that we have evaluated in and are likely to discuss with our Council this evening a minor change amongst items six and seven up there where we would reduce the public building and Facilities to 5000 and seek",

they had an inspected and then all of a sudden they had their electrical permit that was you know that they came on on site and inspected so both those um were outside or the county inspectors so yeah they get they get that inspection as well yeah yeah I mean one question we often ask in inspections where site certificates have um requirements that sort of Punt to other regulations like the National Electric Safety Code or a a code of Federal Regulation that applies to natural gas pipelines we would often ask who have you had to report to or been inspected by in the last year and we want to know what their findings were because the site certificate connects us to that but then we would defer to their expertise but then like building an electrical codes I don't you know I wouldn't ask we wouldn't ask have you been inspected but it certainly is good to know when we hear about it to know that there's eyes on that okay um so pre-construction construction operation incidents really for subprograms underneath the compliance program um we are required to forecast what we believe uh compliance efforts are going to cost for each certificate holder um and then we pre it's called an annual assessment we Bill the certificate holders they're obligated to pay in advance of the Year occurring and then we bill against that so this year's annual assessment based on hours equivalent to cost is a forecast worth four and a half FTE that's how big we think the program is and with an inability to forecast incidents because we will never know what they what the problems are going to be uh so again a plug just for our solutions to that obviously we don't have 4 and a half FTE in compliance we have one and 75 or whatever I'm able to achieve um but we do have the ability to fill two positions and we're working on that we're evaluating the position descriptions um to see if one of those positions can be a doer task manager so that there's oversight of the volume of this um of this program because it's it's I mean it's a little bit for theatrics but 4,000 conditions is a lot um even if we said it's really only half that in substance that's still a lot uh next slide please okay so we just wanted to talk a little bit about public participation um the permitting process meaning reviewing of um an application or an a request for Amendment uh is designed to provide public participation opportunities we issue notices for public comment of hearings once a site certificate is issued that public participation element is a little less clear um a little less obvious and we wanted to take a moment to highlight available information so next slide please fancy so this which is fairly difficult to see if you're looking at it in the room um but this is one of our project Pages for the compliance program and it shows this delineation of preconstruction construction and operation and then gives our staff contact information right now we've identified that the compliance program includes first and foremost Dwayne but it also includ includes Todd and myself so if there an issue is to arise an individual has these contacts they can reach out to and then the next page that we have is an opportunity for members of the public or anyone to request a site inspection at any facility that's in construction or operation so this page includes a link to a form that can be printed or emailed and then the next page is an electronic form that an individual can fill out and submit directly and this is if you know there's a complaint or a concern um they can submit this form and I we really don't get very many of these I would say on average one to two a year and each time uh again we don't forecast a request for inspection and when we get one it's kind of a big deal uh and it takes a lot of time to sort through um um so that's okay counil member Condon thank you chair gr quick question um so if I wanted a site inspection I'm new to the process where where would I go where do I go to the FC website and then drill down um will you go back yeah it's it's kind of difficult but we have this can we make that as big as possible it's right now I think at 58% can we increase it and I just got on the website so oh you're trying to find it now yeah I mean I'm just think okay would it be compliance program yes so I would need to know um if I want an inspection I go to the compliance program i' probably call the department I suppose and they'd say go to compliance you could do that but even so if you're in that dropdown on the left hand side it goes compliance program then underneath that is site inspection request Y and then underneath that is form so if you click on compliance program and uh there is a hyperlink down at the bottom that you can click on to request an inspection and then you could also go directly to the inspection request okay link on that so as long as I know it's under compliance you should be able to find it can find it okay thank you yes go ahead EXC excuse me secretary cornette yeah um so we try to make it relatively obvious you know there' probably some navigation around to find that um but if somebody has a question they could always contact you know staff and then we can direct them to that yeah and I just wanted to point out you know it's what we hope is that an individual can identify the condition that they think is be in violation that's not going to happen it's more like here is a concern they're seeing and then we typically have to figure out how does that fit in with one of the hundreds of conditions and it's challenging um but sometimes it lands in a significant concern where we've issued a notice of non-compliance and gotten DEQ involved and other times it's just not connected and follow so a while back we there was a um complaint um and I think a request for inspection from some adjacent property owners for dust would that have come in has this been available for that for a long time or secretary cornette uh yeah for the record Todd cornette um I'd have to go go into the Wayback machine um it has been available for some time I would say at least six or seven years is probably the ballpark I mean the the ability has always been there or has been there for a long time in rule um but about sixish years ago um we created the link on the website and created a form for people to to fill out prior to that you know somebody would have to either call and ask or no to go looking in the rules so it was much less obvious at that point in time so like I said we we tried to make it obvious um or or at least much more obvious than it previously was you okay so next slide please perfect so as I mentioned to dat Council has 41 active site certificates the council has issued more than that over time just a handful have expired or been terminated or withdrawn so I'll now hand it over to Dwayne to go over the breakdown of facility type type and status for the record Dwayne kills Don or um compliance officer from the Department um so I'm going to start out with uh um basically telling you how many facilities that we have you can obviously read this but I'll go in a little bit more detail um so uh first off you know let's talk about the uh energy facilities and I do want to make a note that Nolan Hills um Nolan Hills facility is approved for wind and solar um so that's um kind of new on the landscape for us the department has 41 energy facilities that that have been issued a site certificate and is under the jurisdiction of the energy facility Council 15 uh total wind farms 12 operating two approved but not under construction and that'd be Nolan Hills um and uh nen Hills Power and Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility East um we have one uh facility under construction and that is um Summit Ridge let me see a second here and that's Summit Ridge uh construction of the remaining facility components uh for Summit Ridge must be completed by August 19th of 2023 so either they have to come in amend their uh site certificate or they have to start construction the last one facility is the wheat Bridge East that facility is approved but not under construction Maybe This Year Department uh also has 10 natural gas facilities which includes two missed underground pipeline facilities the misted underground storage facility and then of these facilities all over all of these facilities are operating the department has 12 solar facilities two are in operating or two are operating Wheat Ridge three solar and um Mont solar facility um it goes by a name uh I I have a hard time saying it I even looked it up in the dictionary but pach Fields is kind of a I don't know if anybody can say that but I I'm just going to uh default to Monte so um so yeah we have eight facilities that are pro and on in construction um did I miss up oh we have two we have two that are under construction Bake Oven solar and Daybreak solar Pro projects eight solar facilities are approved but not under construction the eight would be Borman solar energy facility madis solar energy facility Oregon Trail solar facility uh obsidian solar uh Center Sunset solar project Oregon Trail solar facility Sunset I already I already have Sunset so I already have Sunset so West End project cardi Generating Station um has a 50 wat 50 megawatt solar facility that's been approved but but not under construction so I'm going to move on to other facilities department has three nuclear related facilities the Trojan independent spent uh fuel storage installation the ify and that facility is near Rainer uh we have two research reactors uh Reed and um Reed and Oregon State University OSU also under other facilities is a 51.2 megawatt steam generator and that's in the middle of a um paper mill and it's in Springfield Utility so that's all we have is the just the steam generator also we have one uh ethanol plant that produces 44 million gallons of ethanol each year

        "text": " a opportunity to respond to comments um we will present a a complete review of the draft proposed order at a future council meeting likely the April meeting um the uh certificate holder has requested that the public review process be expedited to the extent possible so we're continuing to work on scheduling with them and you uh to accommodate their requests to the extent we can without impacting opportunities for public participation or the council's review um um great so uh you can see a graphic representation of uh some of the changes proposed in request for Amendment one on the slide here the approved site boundary and micro sighting B are shown in the dark blue color that kind of runs through the middle of the site there in RFA 1 the um certificate holder proposes to enlarge the site uh boundary by ex approximately 74,4 3 acres which would result in a total site area of 78,500 are as um the requested Amendment would also expand micro sighting corridors by approximately 10,058 Acres which would result in total micro sighting area of this slide did have an outdated figure uh that contained a uh an additional Access Road Corridor on the Eastern side of the site that's no longer proposed so if you notice a difference that that's why um in addition to the physical changes and changes to the site uh I did want to point out the certificate holder also proposes to extend the construction completion deadline by three years um that would extend the deadline from uh May 24th 2023 the current deadline to May 24th 2026 next slide please okay um So within that a large site the certificate holder proposes to construct up to 41 additional turbines uh for a total of 107 turbines with a combined generating capacity of up to 300 megawatts um and to serve that larger facility the cerficate older also proposes to expand the 34.5 kilovolt electrical collection system uh with underground collector lines and they per Access Road Network um and also proposes to Reign the 230 kilovolt overhead uh interconnection transmission line along a newly proposed Corridor um as shown in the figure the new transmission line route and sorry it's a little small on the screen in the room hopefully those watching along at home can see uh well the proposed route follows the previously approved route for most of the corridor uh with some differences to the west of spur um spur Loop Road um on the western side of the facility next slide please Nancy um so in addition uh the certificate holder proposes to construct and operate a 30 megawatt battery energy storage system which is 10 megawatts larger than what was previously evaluated um that system would be constructed on a 6.5 acre subite uh substation site north of butter Creek that's shown on the left uh in a the dark blue square towards the top of the image um the certificate holder also request authorization to construct a a substation at a second site uh second 7 Acre Site near little little but creek as shown on the um hard to see in this slide as well but it's a red square okay and next slide okay um also as shown on the left the transmission line would connect the facility to the existing Blue Ridge substation uh which is constructed as part of the other Wheat Ridge facilities um the certificate holder also proposes the utilize the operation and maintenance building at Wheat Ridge 2 in lie of constructing a separate onm building for this facility um as shown on the right the certificate holder proposes a new 60 acre temporary construction yard off of Myers Road uh which is in the central portion of the site the uh certificate holder has requested the flexibility to utilize the four previously approved uh 15 to 20 acre construction yards as well great um so that is generally what's in the amendment um because the proposed uh Amendment uh proposes to add area to the site boundary and what extend construction complete when deadlines the council must determine that the preponderance of the evidence on the record supports the following conclusions uh one that the portion of the facility within the area added to the site by the amendment complies with all laws and Council standards applicable to an original site application and two after considering any changes in facts or law since the date of the current sign certificate was executed that the entire facility complies with all laws and Council uh standards of equal to an original site certificate application um and finally that the amount of the bond or letter of credit uh required for the financial Assurance standard is adequate um and and together I will just point out that these uh these findings generally represent you know a uh almost a a new review of the facility uh the other the where where previous findings are so valid we've made a note of that in the thing but um we have uh gone through a pretty thorough evaluation with this this request um to to that same extent um everything in the complete Amendment request and the draft report order is eligible for comment um and subject to review in this proceeding SL please okay um so in the draft proposed order along those lines the department recommends that existing conditions or existing conditions with minor amendments are adequate to ensure that the facility with the changes in proposed uh proposed in request for Amendment one complies with the standard shown on the screen that includes structural land use Senior Care Resources Recreation Public Services waste minimization public health and safety standards for when facilities and the sighting standards for transmission lines accordingly I won't go over any of those standards anymore in this presentation um if the council does have any questions about those standards um I'd be happy to answer them if if you have comments of course you are welcome to provide those comments um during the period okay great um so we do have uh substantive findings and new recommended conditions or uh amended recommended conditions for the remaining standards I I'll try to go briefly over the major issues that we identified um I will try not to go into as much details on these slides so uh if you do have questions uh please feel free to stop me and and let me know okay so under the evaluation of the council's general standard of review um the department does recommend that the council find that subject to compliance with existing and recommended conditions of approval the facility with the proposed changes does comply with the council standards as well as other applicable laws and rules um I'm going to focus the rest of the presentation primarily on recommendations for new or amended conditions but I will raise major issues um so also under the general standard we recommend the council impose a new condition to require a shared use agreement and financial Assurance um be provided for the shared onm building uh and then to remove orend conditions that would have only applied to the separate own in building uh we recommend the council authorize the proposed transmission line Corridor uh and we recommend that the council Grant the construction completion ex deadline extension um however to comply with the requirements of uh the administrative rules for deadlines that were approved prior to October 2017 uh we recommend the council extend the comment the construction completion deadline by two years not three um under organizational expertise um many of the standards that we have are similar to other uh site certificates so I won't go through them individually um in the request the certificate holder proposes to continue to rely on the organizational expertise of its parent company Nexa energy Resources LLC um the council's previously found that Nexa has the necessary experience to construct and operate facilities um we have amended uh we have recommended amendments to several conditions uh to ensure that the certificate holder maintains access to the parent company's resources and to address uh some compliance issues by requiring enhanced inspections reporting and vetting of contractors in some instances um for the uh soil protection standard um most of the Department's recommend changes are are related to updates to um uh new guidance from DEQ on best management practices associated with erosion control and the erosion and sediment control plan um we've also uh recommended the council amend conditions to provide the department with greater authority to mandate changes to the erosion and sediment control plan um but otherwise uh those those conditions are largely the same for retirement and financial Assurance um the certificate holder estimated that decommissioning the facility With The Changes proposed in rfa1 would cost approximately two uh 20 million um the department reviewed the estimate we found that the methods in unit cost for estimations were reasonable but we dis disagreed with the applicants omission of funds for decommissioning on private access roads and so our adjusted estimate was 28.4 million um and the department recommends the council update conditions of approval to require Assurance um based on this amount for fish and wildlife habitat the majority of the area proposed to be added uh to the site boundary is native perennial grassland habitat or other grassland habitats um and aside from occupied Washington Ground Squirrel Habitat which is considered category one um the majority of the area is considered C Category 2 habitat due to its location in big game winter range um as such mitigation is required for most of the permanent disturbances associated with the request um the DPO recommends the council revise several conditions to incorporate revisions to the habitat mitigation plan revation plan and weed control plan to address uh these additional uh permanent disturbances as well as temporary disturbances in in the habitat areas um and update ODFW guidance on survey protocols and um and other mitigation me measures um and I guess just to point out based on the temporary and permanent impacts of the facility the total mitigation obligation for this facility uh as proposed is estimated to be 299.8 Acres uh for threaten endangered species um the certificate holder did conduct wildlife and Botanical surveys at the site both in support of this request and in the requests and proceedings on other facilities in the area um the surveys do identify Washington ground squirrel colonies uh within the proposed site boundary um the uh avoidance of category one occupied Washington ground scroll habitat required in the site certificate would be maintained um the department has recommended some administrative conditions to uh condition pre1 uh related to ground squirrel to incorporate ODFW guidance on survey methodology and and what needs to be surveyed um botanical surveys identified occurrences of Warren milkvetch which is a state listed threatened plant um throughout the site um the uh certificate holder estimates that the construction and operation of the facility as proposed and request for Amendment one would result in the disturbance of approximately 50 acres of occupied La small fetch habitat um Council previously required avoidance of all occupied War",

kick off the um development of the Oregon energy security plan and we do have a lot to cover today um as you can see with our agenda here I'm Dr Casey Stedman I'll be starting with just giving you an overview of the logistics for this meeting and then I'll hand things off to the Oregon Department of energy so that they can welcome you guys and provide some opening comments we'll then dig into some details about the Oregon Department of energy specifically and the energy security plan and we'll explain your role in the development and implementation of this plan and after a short break I'll come back and introduce our strategy for stakeholder engagement and we'll move on to some energy and security stories and I'll give you a heads up now that there will be a survey at the end of this meeting so that you can give us feedback that we'll be teeing up throughout the um course of the meeting so with that I'm going to go and um oh wait I'm sorry the logistics so logistics for this meeting first we want you to be aware that we are recording this meeting this is so that we can post this on the project website for those who may be joining us later in the project or who couldn't make it today and so for that reason we have disabled the microphones and we have closed the chat however we absolutely want to hear from you so please do take note of the project email address which is energy. secc energy. oregon.gov and then we also have a comment portal online which you can access through the QR code that you can see on your screen right now and you will see these referenced multiple times throughout the talk today so at this point I will hand things off to Janine for welcome comments thank you so much good afternoon everyone my name is Janine Benner and I'm the director of the Oregon Department of energy and I am so pleased to welcome you here this afternoon to work with us to start your work with us on the Oregon energy security plan um the work that the Odo team will be doing in collaboration with all of you in this effort is crucial to the Safety and Security of oregonians and is an obligation to both our state legislature and our federal Partners it builds on a lot of great work that's been happening all around the state at our sister Agencies with local governments and here at the Oregon Department of energy where we have a fuel action plan that we've been able to put into um action a few times recently um and it's building on just Decades of work and relationship building here at Odo um I think it's also a great opportunity to bring together a number of key leaders in our state and uh around the country and I'm really pleased to be able to invite the next person uh up to the podium to join you Megan Levy is a project manager at the state local tribal and territorial team of the office of cyber security energy security and emergency response or Caesar at the US Department of energy we're really pleased to have her partnership and the US Department of Energy's partnership in this effort thanks so much all right thank you Janine um and as Janine said I'm Megan ly I'm I'm so excited to be here a one-time Oregon resident or Oregonian um I am just really excited to see this stakeholder effort we often say in emergency response and energy security that response is relationships and I can't think of a more important relationship than the government with the the people who we serve it's just so so important that we understand the challenges the energy insecurity and that we work together to solve these things so we know that uh this has been an important thing that Congress has been emphasizing since the energy policy and conservation Act of 1974 when State energy offices were created and were uh told that they had to have a plan for shortages of energy and a lot of this was about the Arab oil crisis at the time however we've expanded that definition from not just Transportation fuels now it's about every aspect of energy which is the underpinning of our entire lives as you're watching this on a computer and holding your phone your pocket computer um so we are lucky to have the opportunity of the passage of the infrastructure investment and jobs Act of 2021 which codified state energy security plans on a national scale and in fact defin six different elements that the plans have to incorporate it's one wonderful to see States like Oregon taking it one step further and saying well thank you thanks for saying we should have an energy profile and you know look at all sources of energy both regulated and unregulated that we should look at threats hazards and vulnerabilities both cyber and physical that we should have an actual risk assessment of critical energy infrastructure as well as understand the interdependencies between all infrastructure and energy and that we should do you know mitigation as well as multi-state Regional and tribal coordination but said hey why don't we talk a little bit more about equity and environmental justice and think about what the clean energy transition that we've got so many different goals towards really means for all of us and what does that mean in an energy security perspective so uh while we'll be working with our our friends uh to evaluate all 56 energy security plans from all those States and territories that are mandated to turn one in we'll also be watching processes like this to learn these best practices and hopefully share them with other states in the region and across the country so thanks again for the opportunity to be here and to watch this process and I'll turn it over to my colleague Mr Max Woods the assistant director of the Oregon Department of energy thank you Megan is this slightly okay again my name is Max Woods I am one of the ass directors at the Oregon Department of energy and responsible for amongst other programs oversight of the development of the energy security plan thank you all for joining us today first let me tell you just a little bit about the people and the organization behind the project uh specifically the organ Department of energy uh we are the lead state agency charged with development of our state's energy security plan the Odo mission statement Odo Oregon Department of energy uh is the um our mission statement as it says there on the slide I think is indicative of the knowledge and experience that we bring to this project as it says there Odo leading Oregon to a safe Equitable clean and sustainable energy future we'll talk about a little bit later in this presentation uh while Odo may be the lead coordinating agency U and responsible for delivering the product in the end this is an effort by uh not only federal and state coordination but coordination amongst other state agencies and I particularly want to thank the Oregon Public Utility Commission for working with us so closely on development of this project uh as well as uh throughout our engagement and facilitation program in the coming months with local governments with tribal governments um and other uh stakeholders the next slide here so specifically the division that's leading the separate uh at Odo is the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness division as you can see on the slide we have multiple core program areas many of the people on this call I suspect might be familiar with the work work of my colleague Diana Henry specifically on the work of the Oregon petroleum emergency action plan related to our responsibilities for fuel emergency planning and response or perhaps you're familiar with the work that we've done on nuclear safety and nuclear policy particularly on Oregon's engagement at the Hanford cleanup um projects just north of our state's Border in southeast Washington so before we dive into more of the details starting from the very first principles what is energy security and how do we Define energy security the definition on the screen is how we at Odo have decided to Define it for purposes of this project there's certainly other ways you could consider energy security you can see it's primarily concerned with risks and threats to physical infrastructure and energy systems including energy Supply and I'll note that we adopted this definition from our federal partners with one uh change one addition that we in Oregon made we we added the phrase affordable price and affordability is an important consideration for energy security um as we Define it and as we will embark on this project so that's one of the key changes we made to this to the definition I guess really the only change from our federal uh Federal Partners we think if people can't afford the energy they need for heating cooling Transportation or other needs well that's a form of energy security uh just as much as risk and threats cyber security threats natural Hazard threats to our physical infrastructure transmission lines pip lines uh roads bridges so just a a quick slide here on the uh the process and the history of the Oregon energy security plan and its um and its development uh it's important to note that this isn't the first effort to pull together an energy security plan for the for the State uh people may see the the slide here has uh phot photographs of covers of historical documents and more recent documents that are sort of around the uh the edges shall we say of energy security plan including a 2012 document called the Oregon energy Assurance plan which was led by Deanna Henry at the time uh we now consider that plan to be um out of date we haven't updated it uh and our plan now is to work on a wholesale Redevelopment um with the Oregon energy security plan uh moving forward and the en Assurance plan from 2012 uh kind of put on the shelf and maybe part of the historical archives now see this is my slide here we go and finally before I turn it over to deian Henry to speak uh to some more slides I want to make note that this project involves multiple Partnerships uh our development team uh working closely with Federal Partners at the US Department of energy other state agencies particularly the Public Utility Commission as I mentioned earlier and of course uh as you'll see later in the presentation we are looking to engage with local Partners County governments City governments tribal governments as well as utilities private energy companies Community groups and the public the strategy for pulling together this plan is a little bit of um uh collecting historical documents and and current documents that are related to energy security that might already exist uh pulling them into one place as well as developing and doing new analysis collecting new information gathering new data and assessing risks and threats to Oregon's",

energy projects that uh Council has to review them to uh determine whether or not they need to or to determine whether or not they conform to State policy so that sort of informs the options here we just have two options uh one option one would be um approve the recommended finding that no changes are required to the DEQ rules at as proposed to conform them to State policy and then option two would be recommended EQ that changes be made to the rules that they proposed to conform them to State policy so and again those changes are the allowing the developer to assume a 26 DBA ambient level and to uh seek waivers from land owners uh which again the land owners do not have to provide whether or not you know regardless of what is being offered they can just say I don't want a project it's too loud and you there's no amount of money you can offer me then the developer would be just back at square one under the ex existing rules okay um I see a hand I see a couple of hands up um Vice

nitpicky um we see projects that are both wind and solar as opposed to wind or solar and in this language here it is written as or solar and I'm wondering uh you know if that works for us um with a wind and solar not not distinct um I I guess I'd be kind of curious if what Patrick's take on that would be my reaction would be that you you I mean people could argue anything regardless of how reasonable it is you you could make the argument that it wouldn't apply to a combined facility given that language but I think it's pretty reasonable to interpret the language as proposed as applying to a facility that had wind and solar because it's saying that these noise rules apply if there's wind or if solar which a wind and solar facility would would meet both of those right hence the and I guess I'm I'm just wondering I would I would just add this is creates more flexibility for the developers and so if they wanted to argue that you know a wind and solar facility wasn't applicable to that then they would they would be required to do the noise monitoring to justify the level so it's it's adding flexibility it's not taking anything away it's creating flexibility so it wouldn't behoove them to try to make an argument to say uh it doesn't apply because the whole purpose of this is to create some benefit and flexibility to the developers so I I would doubt that we would see that kind of argument this is this is Pat with doj can everyone hear me I got a message from Nancy saying that it's a little difficult to hear me we can hear you wavering you're you're establishing right now with with this discussion if there's any question in the future about what your intention was I think this discussion is establishing that the intention uh in passing this rule would to have it apply to combined wind and solar facilities that's my understanding is that correct councelor cond yeah okay I mean if the discussion suffices um as evidence I mean that that is you can you can certainly revise the proposed rule language if you think that that uh you know if that's what you're advising I'm pointing out that if you don't and there's a dispute in the future or a question in the future about what council's intent was we could go back and review this transcript and that would support the position that you intention is that it applied to combined facilities although just just for clarification these are not your rules these are the department of environmental qualities Environmental Quality commission's rules so what you're being asked to do is uh because of this statute is to make sure that you know an agency in this case teq is not proposing rules that would not conform to you know specified policies so you're not approving these rules ultimately it's going to be de Q um and so you're just asserting um that these are consistent with State policies and that's where Council has some Authority not just with DEQ but any state agency that is proposing rules you know that we look at and say Hey you know is that GNA have essentially an implication on your ability to review projects and if it is you have the authority to tell that state agency you need to make changes so it's again this is a little bit of a you know you know one step removed from the authority you know you have some Authority here but you don't have the direct Authority you just have indirect Authority related to these rules thanks thanks Todd for reminding us of of the context that that is an Point councelor delin Mr chairman are you ready for a motion I is well we can take the motion and if there's any more discussion we can continue so uh yeah go ahead Mr chair I move that the council affirm the proposed amendments to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality noise rules and orgon administrative rules 340 division 35 conformed to the state policies and organ revised statutes 469010 and organ revised Statute 469 310 and that no changes are necessary do we have a second um this is councelor Condon um I second motion okay we've got a motion in a second any further discussion okay uh secretary cornette could you please call the rooll Richard delin hi Perry chaku yes Ken how yes Marcy Grail yes Katie IMS yes Cindy Condon yes motion carries Mr chair thank you secretary cornet okay the next item is the public notice discussion it's a information item and public comment opportunity uh so we'll have um Todd Cornett the assistant director for sighting um do this um item please all right give me a moment to share my screen and by the way Tom good job on all three of those efforts that you were doing thank all right let me know if you can see we presentation Y is it the is it the presentation or is the presentation it's full presentation it's presentation adjacent Todd You're Gonna Want to switch the other window all right I thought that might be the case all right I'm gonna stop sharing yeah yeah gotta stop sharing give me a second okay did I get that one did I get right time it looks good okay all right well thank you for the record Todd cornette assistant director for sighting and secretary so this um agenda item we're gonna have three parts to it the first is I'm going to do my presentation which is going to go over kind of generally you know public uh participation and then specifically I'll focus on one notice um and then we'll open up the public comment and then get into kind of council discussion so you ultimately it's going to be regarding U notices what should and shouldn't we include in notices and there's one example that I'll be using all right so on this slide you know regarding Public Notices um for an application you can see there are um Five Points where you know in the in that process where we provide notice uh in an amendment there are four places where we provide notice um but as I said I'm going to talk you know I'll get back to what's in red um but I want to talk a little more broadly about the the different areas where we try to educate the public and and provide a better opportunity for them to understand what the process is what the projects are and then what their role in the process um is so here's the kind of the first of those so under an application you know we have certain meetings and hearings in the vicinity of the project so for an application we have the notice of intent public information meeting we have the complete application public information meeting and we have the draft proposal public public hearing and those all occur in the vicinity of the project in order to make the public um you know available we certainly will run those in a hybrid fashion as well so people can participate either in person or remotely um but you know we think there's there's certainly value in having those uh in the vicinity you know of the the project locations and then for an amendment uh specifically for the type a process there is also a draft proposal sort of public hearing and that um also occurs within the vicinity of the project so for every project we have a website set up and you know these are all the elements within that you know and again there's no legal um what we have within our notices you know where information can be available and that's talked about a web page but the the description does not get into the this level of detail of what we include in each website but again you know what are the things that we include to make the information available the project description that's our own kind of version of it what the current status of the project is um the contact information for the applicant and the department of energy Representatives so people can be you know asking questions directly to them um and then kind of throughout the process you once we receive a preliminary request that'll get posted uh when we have a complete request you all of the elements all of the exhibits will be included on there and broken out in a way that people can you know open up individual exhibits if they want um any of the notice is associated that I talked about before uh we have an email link uh where people can um sign up to receive um or a link for people to sign sign up to receive email notices once the draft proposed order is issued that's put on there same with the proposed order the final order and then other things that we put on there um you know a link to the online mapping tool there's also a PDF of the project map we put in Wildlife monitoring reports and uh anytime we have Amendment determination requests and determinations those get posted as well again all trying some of them are mandatory um but all are intended to kind of make the process more understandable to the public and then other things things um and you'll hear more about some of these uh from om when she gives her presentation but there are other things that we've developed over time um to try to make you know information about the process you know more understandable to the public we developed the public guide uh we have links to all of the standards we have a monthly sighting project update so somebody doesn't have to",

        "text": " application that is we will evaluate the notice of intent we will come up with that we will look at all the different locations that the project has proposed in what are all the issues but we also want to hear from local governments tribal governments state agencies and the public to determine what those particular requirements should be so this is why we're seeking input right now is to help us create the project order and I'll talk about that a little bit um and just to make sure people and the applicant will talk about their schedule but the notice of intent is good for two years so we often have projects we'll come in at this stage people will get this information and the project will go dark for a couple of years that is not untypical so that could happen here I don't know that it will but I just wanted to make sure people are aware so we have the documentation you know the handouts on the table in the back of the project page you can sign up to receive notices email notices so if you want to keep track of the projects but you want to be looking all the time please sign up for the email notices because at the next stage then we will provide notice to you if you didn't get it already through paper or by email um I'm not going to talk about all the rest of the steps but you can see then the application comes in we do the draft proposed order which is really just kind of a staff report where we determine um you know the staff evaluates uh whether or not the applicant has met the burden of proof of all the standards and then ultimately it goes all the way to the energy facility citing council at the far right for their decision what's not on the slide is the appeal path so unlike the local land use process we go directly to the Oregon Supreme Court so if decision is made by the council whether that's an approval or denial the appeal path goes directly to the Oregon Supreme Court and they have six months within which to make their final decision so that is a pretty big variation in terms of how our process works versus the local process next slide please so we are a standards-based process meaning there's a whole set of standards that the applicant has to meet and it's their burden to prove based on information that they submit in their application to show that they meet all of these standards it's not you know for us to determine that you know it's not for the council they have to provide all of that evidence and we evaluate that and we ultimately make that recommendation and the council then makes that conclusion whether or not they meet that but we also seek your input to know whether or not there are issues or elements that we're missing you know that the applicant Miss in the application or that we missed in our review of the application so again that's why it's very important to you know for those who are interested to continue to participate continue to provide comments to us so that we better understand the location the issues and how those relate to all of our standards applicants have to meet the same set of Standards there's 16 standards that everybody has to meet and then there's some additional standards um that are specific to some projects so you can see the far right there are two standards the citing standards for transmission lines that's specific to this project but necessarily a winter solar project and the need standard they have to prove need as well so I won't get into those right now um but again be thinking about you know if you have issues or concerns they really you know ultimately need to relate to the standards because that's how we can review this project next slide please so as part of their application or their notice of intent um the applicant has to do a survey level or desktop level study of certain resources so the top one is historic and cultural and archaeological resources land use you can see so the center of the bullet um or the the bullseye would be the project on this diagram and then the distance that they have to evaluate these different resources you can see the distances that they go out so this is what they've already had to do in their notice of intent when they submit their application these May expand or these May contract that's what we established in the project order so again that that prior slide where I said the next step is the project order we want to hear from people to say are these the right distances is you know half a mile for land use wild you know wildfire and Fish and Wildlife right or should it be less or should it be more you know if you know of issues that are you know 0.6 miles versus 0.5 miles please provide comments on that that helps us to evaluate whether we should keep these study areas the same for the application or if they need to go next slide please uh land use is an interesting part so it's one of our standards one of the 14 or 16 rather Council standards the applicant has a choice they can either go what's called path a where they seek local land use approval they would go to the city or county with you know who's whose jurisdiction within which the project is located and seek the land use approval from that city or county or they can request the energy facility citing Council have that authority to review currently the applicant has requested that the energy facility citing council do the entire landish review for the entire length of the line so that's what we're going with right now they ultimately have to make that choice prior to submitting the application but right now they are seeking to consolidate that and that is my last slide so I just wanted to reiterate what Chris said is you know once we're done with this we'll have a q a once we're done with the Q a if anybody wants to stick around and have specific questions to either you know myself Chris any other member of our team or the applicant team will be here as long as you're interested in asking us questions so thank you great thank you Todd uh and if you could go to the next slide please okay so one of the unique features of a transmission line siding project is that the applicant is required to provide a corridor selection assessment uh along with their application um that assessment must uh both justify and explain why they selected the proposed routes that they they included in the application um and one thing I wanted to point out is that in the noi there are multiple corridors proposed near the Western interconnection and I'll show those on a map in a second but as I said before the proposed corridors are subject to change in the final application that's a valid uh thing to do the applicant May propose adjustments in the application or they may propose them at one of these meetings and and I also wanted to point out that the applicant must consider public comments in their final Corridor selection so um please keep that in mind when you're asking night or when you're preparing your written comments if you could go to the next slide um this shows the Western end uh near Portland and I just want to point out that the primary proposed route um continues in the river to about the midpoint of Hayden Island and then crosses the island uh and goes under the north Portland Harbor and comes on land and then travels on Marine Drive to the converter station site um the alternate that has been proposed would come online at Broughton Beach and then follow Marine Drive um uh both of those proposed routes are currently under consideration if they are included in the application we would review both of them um and the applicant would be authorized to construct one of the two Napa um if you could go oh and then there is a second uh small option uh just to connect the converter station to North Lombard uh North Lombard Street show there in option three um these are all shown I think in the noi uh if you if you want to see a more detail map in the applicant will also be explaining the proposed route in more detail during their presentation you could go to the next slide please okay and um there is only one quarter proposed on the Eastern end of the proposed line um but I did want to show it since we are here in the Dallas tonight so uh I I will again let the Apple can describe this but I did want to just point out um that there is an online online segment um that will be connecting to the big Eddie substation uh next slide please okay uh and then finally um before I turn it over the application applicant I just wanted to point out um that there is an opportunity for the public to provide written comments um all written comments should be submitted to Odo by June 1st so we can uh consider them and include them uh when we prepare our project order um you can also provide comments during the Q a session during this meeting um and again I just want to point out that this meeting is not a public hearing um or it conductive case hearing and participation isn't required now um or in writing to preserve standing for uh for the Contessa case later in the review um and with that I'm going to turn it over to the applicant team thank you I want to thank you for being here and uh I'm Chris Hawker with Cascade renewable transmission the applicant uh again I want to thank the fsex staff for holding this meeting and for those of you who took the time to come out and learn more about the project what was the project uh and before I start uh I just want to acknowledge that we are well aware that this whole area the Columbia Gorge area and well beyond is uh part of the ancestral homeland of tribal Nations and we intend to conduct the development of this project uh with that very much in mind and to and we realize this is just the first step in hopefully building a authentic um with that next slide please fsec I think wants us to focus primarily on the uh where and the what of this project but uh we're also going to go through some of the aspects of the why of this project um and we're trying not to belabor that but I think it's important to understand the context uh next please the whole rationale for this project is uh started with the passage in both Oregon and Washington of legislation that mandates uh the transformation of energy to a decarbonized economy and the two states mandates are slightly different but uh basically uh the deadline for achieving 80 percent of the goals is the year 2030. which may sound like a",

        "text": " on um they're they're still working through some really preliminary um contracting um down in california you know relating to the consultants that could hire to do this work so i don't really have too much more to share on this yet either engaging with public outreach with oregon stakeholders is one of the the big reasons we wanted to get involved as well so stay tuned i think is is probably the big takeaway for that i just wanna know yeah there was a couple hands up i saw sean's hand earlier but joshua's hands up right now so i wanted to um go to joshua to see what his question or comment was and invite sean if you wanted to put your hand back up if you wanted to make a comment or question you can do that too go ahead joshua all right okay thanks joshua fan with climate solutions um it seems like you know kind of at a high level sort of in the broad scope of things there's a lot of questions outstanding questions about transmission availability i'm you know i'm a policy guy so kind of looking at this at you know at a fairly high level you know not only questions about if there will be transmission available for the three gigawatts you know that's the but also looking into the future you know 5 10 15 20 gigawatts that's of floating offshore wind um but boom is you know seems to be moving fairly quickly towards possible leases um so i'm wondering if if you are with bone kind of thinking about the of these things making sure that you know as their process moves forward and there's possible leases that the transmission is in place and then also wondering um there's a study that odo did in december on regional transmission organization um that specifically living offshore wind um and you know the cost benefits they could come from sharing that cost among uh different beneficiaries in different states have you looked at that rto study in your in your scenario planning i can start and then maybe pass it to some of my colleagues thanks for um raising those uh questions joshua and especially for um sharing with the broader audience the regional transmission operator study um just as a quick kind of response as we understand from boem their process will take um many years and part of the call area that they're putting out is to understand better what the market interest is from developers and developers will have a bit more detail on sort of the pros and cons of certain locations as it relates to transmission access but there is likely needed investment there as you've heard from from this presentation and probably others um and i'm you know who covers the cost of those investments some are related specific to specifically to a project but also there's some bigger um transmission operators in the region that have been thinking about this too good questions as far as it relates to our coordination with boehm we we have been coordinating with bone they're familiar with this with this study and um our work but i think they're also really looking to the boem call area release as uh to get a better understanding of developer and market interest and then adam and jason well do you want to add anything to that response and adam do you want to say anything more specific about the rto study and i can put that in the chat for people too yeah thanks ruchi and thanks for the question um so i i led that study on the regional transmission organization effort back in the fall for those who might not be aware and ruchi if you could put that in the chat that'd be great i think the issue there um as as i think about this really has to do with so if you look at this map that's displayed on the screen right now the sort of uh pinkish color to our south right in california is the california independent system operator um they have a peak load of i want to say it's in the 40 000 megawatt range it covers 80 some percent of the state of california um it allows them to do more regional planning and understand regional needs you know across multiple utility service territories so contrast that with the northwest but you can see here we have dozens of balancing authorities different utilities that are each planning resources balancing their uh independently so when it comes to thinking about large-scale resources like offer wind uh there has been some suggestion that an rto may potentially help facilitate thinking about that sort of resource planning over over a longer time horizon um i wouldn't say it's a prerequisite but it's i think could be a potentially helpful mechanism should one uh develop here in the in the years ahead thanks adam yeah i can't think of anything to add i think there was a i'm trying to remember it was uh had a multi-faceted question there from josh i believe it was um but i think it's he had some early questions about timing and you know that's kind of why we're here to some extent um of course we're here because boehm um is also here and and starting this process but um it's easy to kind of lose track of the forest for the trees a little bit i think at least i kind of hear a lot of questions about um scope and timing and who's going to buy it and you know are we going to build all this stuff where we're going to build it when one is going to be built the the scale that we need to do to the scale development to kind of beef up the ports um even just the timelines from the earlier enroll study we're looking at like the cost effectiveness of of the technology itself coming down you know 10 years from now so transmission's another long lead time item you know it it takes 10 15 years kind of just to scratch the surface and get get projects permitted and planned and designed before construction even begins and then a few years of construction you can always count up too so it'd be great if if this stuff kind of organized itself but but there's a lot of moving pieces here you know just starting the conversation now about 10 15 years ahead of ahead of when some of these resources might first get built is really is really the first step in kind of making sure that we're thinking about and we are coordinating all these activities across all these different planning entities and regions and um interests and you know the the local community and tribal engagement and i mean there's just this is a big project um or a big big series of projects really big scope and and everybody's kind of doing their best and trying to look around corners and see how we can plan for the future awesome thanks jason i'm gonna move over to sean for for your question or comment go ahead you know i i just wanted to jump in and and first thank everybody for the presentation jason i think is got a provide a lot of good helpful information with respect to what the the northern grid processes look like and what transmission looks like a couple of you know minor points of clarification at northern grid we received only two economic studies and there's still a process that has to go through the the membership and and the state representatives with respect to deciding which of those uh two will uh ultimately end up being selected etc so that like jason described that'll that'll end up having to play itself out one thing i wanted to touch on with respect to you know just offering a little bit of more information or a bit of a clarification is with respect to transition planning transmissions planning you know what the the goal transmission planning is to meet essentially the needs of of at the local level the the transmission provider and at the at the regional level the needs of the membership of that region and and needs are pretty specifically defined they relate to reliability and load service needs and then also those commercial obligations uh that jason described uh so you know read into that as transmission service requests and and so those are the needs that are um you know the uh trying to be met now inclusive of those are your public policy requirements um you know like hb 2021 like ceta et cetera those will drive those needs right you know to the extent that you have new transmission service requests uh you'll you'll have to plan in order to be able to meet those needs one thing i wanted to make sure that everybody understood is not currently part of the transmission planning process you know the order 1000 process as you know described by ferc is interconnections generally are not considered as part of the transition planning process um those come later uh you know integrating new resources into the system uh happen uh or they get planned for as those those transmission service requests get made because that's what you're actually then trying to use to deliver those resources to load um because an interconnection can take on a couple of different forms it can take on just you know essentially what amounts to plugging it in versus actually delivering it to a specific load in a specific location and and because of that that's one of the reasons that interconnections are not something that's typically viewed as as part of the transition planning process and and that's not to say that when trying to interconnect a resource like offshore wind um that analysis won't be done in order to facilitate it it will it's just part of a separate process and um just just uh just a small point of of clarification and and i really want to also uh emphasize the notion of of transmission rights um you know that's uh uh what i was alluding to earlier when we were talking about uh california is potentially being an off taker and you know there's still maybe a bottleneck at the inner tie so the ac the dc inner tie etc because uh in order to uh schedule energy to flow across those those those those facilities those paths you have to have transmission rights that you can utilize in order to do so and and transmission rights the amount of available transmission capacity are the things that are born out of the reliability planning processes and so that's why you know i again i just you know uh wanna and i probably sound like a a broken record uh i just wanna emphasize that um you know before uh uh we get too settled in on on really thinking that you know 2.6 or three or whatever is the number that the system can actually handle that we allow these processes to play themselves out um you know because you know uh just you know you know i don't want uh what i would hate to see is everybody get uh overly",

Is there any other question for Josh about this topic. Thank you, President. I remember seeing at the beginning of the year. Well, maybe in September, that the Edge Rap program was about to disappear. And I was quite surprised we were just celebrating the success. of the program and I was not surprised not to see in the budget Does anyone know what happened to that rap program And what is going to happen regarding its return Good afternoon again Sorry, there is the program made into rap Well, rather when we talk about it disappearing, no It's so much that it left, but that it changed its focus and its form, the budget amount decreased and that is partly because we have had challenges due to covid, locating people, finding places for them to stay in the private market and also because they have there have been resources available through the State different supports that we have received and that we have been using instead of what we used this approach has the objective is now to help people who can participate from earlier stages that they can stabilize and move on to navigation center that they stabilize in that environment and then move on to permanent housing again does not mean that it disappeared simply the approach was Okay thank you I'm glad that we were able to answer very well very good it is a good program any other questions We will have time at the final so if it occurs to you later do not hesitate to say it Kelly could you help us with the atmosphere part Good evening it is a pleasure to be with you as George said I am Candy Line Dembow and I am budget manager for the city it is a pleasure to be before you introducing you the budget for the natural environment area the resources have to do with public works monitoring and education as already said on page 177 the topic of programs begins and you can find more information about services and positions in that same section this area has more of $24.9 million in proposed funding for four major programs the water treatment portion resource management area quality monitoring compliance with federal state permits and working toward action plan goals there are several positions that provide water-related services environment those scheduled about the environment and the changes we have made for this section the fund wants to add new positions in this area one with one limited position and three full-time positions The limited management one is going to support the water permitting department of quality and that consists of a maintenance operator to support with the maintenance needs of water infrastructure and assets of natural areas, one to provide support for the rainwater infrastructure and another operator to support cleaning and sweeping the streets at night. We moved from trustworthy and secure infrastructure for this budget and with that we had seven feet. We see this increase in this budget and we also have an engineering What happened and we reclassified her to a project woman to work on the action plan and the implementation activities and the budget has to do with funds to review stormwater codes and see standards to meet the new permit requirements and this stormwater master plan is going to be approved at the end of this year the projects projects for waste water, it will be mentioned if the pilot has functions, this will be installed in real time and it will give us characteristics of waste water to see contaminants that are added to the water and to see different treatment options for these waters an inventory of parks for the year 2024 to provide information on the condition of the species and in these parks according to the classifications these parks can be managed more closely Including those that are in poor condition and that are susceptible if these inventories have 38,000 action points mainly collecting this data on the rights of way this effort adds more trees to the streets and there are also maintenance projects And it is in the current budget to repair since it is concreted or replace mechanisms and also anticipate the incredible clarifications in other components that have to be removed from the sewage and managers are going to be carried out inside the tanks of their managers collect and dispose of this helps us drive the plant to put light to the plant and eliminates the slots and we also see these facilities to increase capacity for periods during the year where solids cannot be applied and with that we are ready for your questions and also to eliminate waste which I had to tell you what the counselor does today and I and we had the opportunity to take a tour and that place is amazing that place of the three We really saw this beautiful place and I was going to go with you but my children got sick afterwards we went together we stood there and said Wow it's incredible to see what I say this often because you can't understand what makes the city really work so let's go to those facilities like these to realize how many things are going on near us under our feet and also if you are interested in visit any of the facilities we will be delighted that you come to visit us and of course I am going to take you at your word because it is really surprising I have no questions I know I have one to start with because there are very good things and I feel that every time I I read I see another I know that counselor Barney and others there are things that are important that they are working on and I really member coen Yes thank you very much I have a question I'm just going to take them one by one because Willow Park is the Opera the city of Salem and is owned by the cities of Salem Yes then well page 83 that serves the urbanized areas of the eastern part of Salem those are cities and urbanized areas from the eastern part and these fall within the operation of Lake Huilao and this is shown within our budget this transfer of funds I know that Bryan is about to come to respond good evening everyone I am the director And yes they pay like all the users of those facilities everyone pays those who use those it is reflected in the budget no It is not shown separately it is simply added but it is included Thank you very much any other question very good we have a couple of technical issues here thanks for the answer the second question in we saw that we have a goal to have 38% of The canopy how are we doing in terms of the injured trees and I saw in that cover or in those awnings I saw that through the two we replanted some of the trees we want to see what happens with these statuses and the replanting and here and bad Ana is answering you can also answer this where we are in that process and involved with these awnings but I can answer questions as to how many trees were planted we lost about a thousand trees on the city streets due to the ice storm and the council approved hire four people to four people and six months after the program we had already achieved most of the objectives of planting the trees we had lost a thousand and we put new poles and we are going to continue planting more trees in this next year and part of it is established here and We also have to water the trees and we also have an We detected in Oregon that a PC was coming from Portland and it hurts the trees and there is a cup of the vascular system of the trees and in two years the trees die from this pest then we have We have a large population of these trees that we are very worried here in Sal because fifteen hundred trees in the city are going to be affected by this pest we are creating a program at this time it is not going to be shown in theaters for five years but we are working very closely with the odf and the oda to try to figure out how we can stop this plague from coming and to see the next steps we are going to remove and replace because the 99% mortality rate when it comes is going to affect everyone the trees in the city and if we want to save these trees it is going to be a period in which we can manage through herbicide injections and These are Ash Trees that we are talking about so it is very important those Ash Trees we want to keep them for several years and we We can do it through injections that are going to be cheaper than removing the tree. So we have to tell the management team and you that we finally have some ideas on how to handle it. The good news is that there is a lot of recent funding from the Federal Government that the odf will be able to access to help us with the fish in particular towards the Fresnos and as for the mantas, could someone talk about it yes odf is the reforestation department and Brian what I wanted to point out is that we have a program to Planting trees is not necessarily reflected in this area of \u200b\u200bwork, but we are going to get there next week and we have three hundred thousand dollars of investment to plant trees from the funds and we are treating trees. I don't have the numbers. We are earning every year in particular with the small trees that take longer to grow But we can get more information for you to give to you George and we can give it to you next week we have some questions Yes yes I have questions and I'm going to leave my week of my question of the trees for the other week I'm very very excited and I'm delighted to hear information about the Oregon micromaya does anyone have information about it I think we have some staff and Alan is reaching out to answer Yes good evening I'm Alien I'm the city engineer for this project for those of you who don't know is a gold energy department partnered with pg and is going to fund battery storage at Oxford Street and 22nd to store batteries and that is going to power a feeder for a building and that work is going to start at the end of this excuse me but I can't breathe that it's coming so fast talk we talk to us we are going to bring it to the city manager to sign",

        "text": " the hydro well it's interesting um so it's it's a it's a big system right so it's uh well we have a drought here maybe in the western part of oregon uh what really drives a lot of this has to do with the canadian rockies and the snowpack in montana and uh pretty far inland so you really have to look and you know certainly keep an eye on it and bonneville does and there's forecasts so even though we've been in this drought the last few years we've been hovering around average um so if you look at that you know the 80 water years they showed all those blue lines it's been around average uh you know the last really uh really low year was around the 2000 2001 energy happened to be an extremely low water so yeah it's sort of because our basin is so large it's sort of it's hard to uh necessarily extrapolate the drought conditions you have locally in one place to the overall basin but i think i saw another hand so i think it was perry yeah um perry choptoot um i want to uh bring up a kind of an issue and it's the old antiquated uh dam when they spill they spill from the top and so when water has a chance to be backed up by a dam it ends up getting warm and so when you spill from the top you essentially put warm water downstream with new technology out dams spill from beneath it puts cold water out there downstream is the difference between dams like the cold and rivers dam over in the rogue valley versus the various dams on the klamath river the salmons and fish seem to uh fare pretty well in in the rogue you know of course they have their moments but uh on the klamath you know we've we've listed a new species this last year um on the endangered species list and um it seems to be pointing toward this antiquated hydro system to be changed but it costs a lot of money uh the majority of the dams down on the klamath were so antiquated for the purpose of an example and i know it may be a exaggeration on the slight side but i was always told that the dams on the klamath generated as much power as your bike did with the generator from the light on the front so it uh it kind of um it's time for change to uh get up to standard for uh elec electricity production and when we don't do it we see the loss of aquatic life we see things being put on the endangered species list and i just wanted to let you know because i know there's a lot of uh um information out there on the which will be the largest dam removal in the united states history and that's the four on the klamath and so i just wanted to have a chance to to say that thank you very much for your time yeah no thank you and uh i certainly appreciate that i spend a lot of time in very active conversations with the governor's office oregon's department of fish and wildlife and the federal government over salmon recovery issues on the columbia and the lower snake river in particular those on the the media may be familiar that governor brown has called for breaching the four lower snake river um those are much more uh power powerful than the uh the the bike uh the bike example you cited uh those are about a thousand average megawatts uh 3 000 megawatts of nameplate capacity uh so a thousand average megawatts that's uh on the scale of the columbia generating station um those four projects there in southeast washington but um that's point well taken and it's uh it's certainly an active area of negotiation by our state at the very highest levels the governor is very interested in this but i should say there's a you know um particularly the large-scale hydro projects uh maybe the klamath ones uh are a bit different um they're incredibly valuable to the power system right they can provide that energy capacity and flexibility with carbon-free resources that's really uh highly you know highly desirable in balancing wind and solar on the system to meet our carbon goals but um they're definitely trade-offs i'm sorry can you go back i wanted to point one out on the slide sorry just just because there was more conversation about it and and you know the discussion was really about hydro but i was going to point out the wind you know because i think that's important the slide i think importantly kind of explains at least council you know that when we receive you know applications you know that we always talk about the nominal generating capacity so that would be the blue line um or the blue part of the graph and you know but what the actual uh production is is the orange and so it makes sense because you know as adam clearly has pointed out wind does not blow the entire day or you know every day consistently you know across the year as well so you know even in our statutes it's essentially anticipated to be about a of what the name plate capacity is and i think that graph actually plays that out pretty well that um that it is about a third of the capacity of what the potential is you know again because it only is producing power when the wind is blowing but but i think that's a good example and i'm sure we'll see the same thing with with solar as well it might be it's you know a different sort of mix you know but as we get more solar kind of operational we'll see some you know similar but that's where we see but we always tell you what maximum potential is but that's only if it's you know going 24 7 365 and it's not you know for at least renewable it won't be because they'll produce power you know when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining but i think that's a good example of you know where you know again when you know it's about a third sort of capacity i think this reflects that pretty well that's right and then solar solar in the state is around the 20 to 25 range um and it's one thing i'll point out about wind is it is highly site specific so you know a third is probably roughly uh for terrestrial wind in the state of oregon is probably about right as this shows um but there's quite a bit of interest in uh some of the kind of mountain states in wyoming they have wind that's more in the kind of 40 to 50 percent range and then there's offshore wind which is of increasing uh interest in the state and the region and there you're talking up north of 50 um 55 60 even potentially there is some more upside potential in wind uh conceivably and that is yeah so over on the top just that uh it kind of jumps off at you i think if you look at this but the coal natural gas and nuclear are quite a bit different story right those bars are much closer right and that's because they're not fuel limited uh for the most part you know with some exceptions you can have issues but generally if a if a coal natural gas or nuclear plant wants to generate it can because it'll have the fuel available to and the only reason those aren't even closer is that they do go down for planned maintenance and outages um and probably not surprisingly in our region that tends to happen in the april may june time frame uh because there's so much hydro available um so it's somewhat somewhat predictable when those are going to go off so let me catch us up here so here's just another another look at this so this is looking at um monthly output so this is actual output from us eia for the calendar year 2020 across the four northwest states not just oregon but oregon washington montana and so the few things i'll note not surprising right the blue bar is the biggest hydro was our biggest resource and i should know this is actual uh these are uh the output from facilities located in those four states so it doesn't take into account imports exports which is uh something stephanie will touch on as we at at the end of our presentation so this is just uh what's generated from the facilities physically located in one of those four states so hydra is the biggest of course you see it pointing out there that red bar if you pull out your magnifying glass you'll see solar starting to show up this is 2020. coal is retiring rapidly right so these black bars will have to be replaced just something to something the flag here and another thing i want to point out is how big the natural gas and coal contributions are in the fall and winter months those are going to be a lot more challenging for us here in the northwest to replace with solar than say in a place like california not only do we have cloudier winters than they do but we have colder winters so we have higher heating loads in the winter um so just pointing that out it's likely to be a bigger challenge uh for us than in some warmer weather climates all right so now we'll do a quick view of where we headed right um this is from the northwest power council uh they are uh might be familiar a regional non-profit body uh that does uh regional power planning for the four state region and this is from last fall they put out a looking at the entire west of how much renewable generation is going to be by 2040 to achieve carbon policy objectives in place across the west and they found 350 gigawatts of new renewable generation now this is on a nameplate basis um but 350 gigawatts of nameplate renewables over the next 20 years it's sort of hard to uh really uh grasp how big that is but it's uh it's enormous it's about 10 times the size of the entire existing northwest hydropower system in terms of installed capacity and the modeling shows that's needed in the next 20 years and then here's the just the northwest not from the northwest power council but this is from a consultant study that looked at economy-wide decarbonization so this would be going even further than hp 2021 but this is an expectation of many of sort of where things are going to have to head in terms of renewable development to really achieve deep decarbonization of the economy and their their study found 80 gigawatts of new wind and solar just in the northwest so these are these are big numbers",

        "text": " able to join us from deq right so let's say we have just about everyone here um so with that let's uh jump in so this will be a bit different like i mentioned earlier um definitely some review here for some folks but again just want to provide some level setting um both members of the committee and and for members of the public who are who are listening to this and kind of wondering where this conversation is coming from it's uh there's quite a bit of activity going on in this space um so we just thought we would review it briefly and uh commissioner tony thanks to you she's uh kind of uh co-presents some of these slides with me here uh so just kind of want to touch on three major kind of substantive functions that kind of come in these conversations a lot that i wanted to mention so one is really just buying and selling electricity that's kind of the one i think we talk about a lot with uh with rto markets for instance and that's really just buying inside electricity uh to ensure that customer demand can be met in real time then there's the issue of resource adequacy which is really about planning and evaluating procuring sufficient capacity to meet future customer demand and then transmission planning and so identifying the needs to maintain system reliability and be able to deliver that generation to meet customer demand so those were the three main categories uh a little more detail on each of those just at a very high level uh sort of the kind of time frame and time horizons that each of these uh kind of buckets looks at you know by any sign of electricity can happen over a wide range of time frames from years into the future through power purchase agreements months ahead day ahead to real-time markets happening uh on sub-hourly um a variety of mechanisms but the two majors that uh well that come up in these conversations bilateral agreements and centralized markets and get into a little more about what what that means resource adequacy um again some variety here in the time horizons but typically on a planning basis it's looking out three or five years uh but then there's some shorter time frames involved as well thinking about whether there's a sufficient capacity to meet future demand and the mechanisms here vary widely across the country certainly so i won't go into much detail here but uh very ba specific and what's a ba we'll get to that in a moment as well uh puc role and planning typically and again multiple different types of mechanisms and agreements um for resource advocacy uh transmission planning and operation so on the planning side this is probably i would say the longest time verizon of the three major categories here that can be really 10 plus years when you're looking at identifying a need citing permitting building it's quite a long process and then of course an operations varies widely down to the you know um and again a wide range of mechanisms there uh particularly on the planning side a lot of variation across the so balancing authorities or bas as uh you know was talked about last time you'll hear again a lot today um what does a balancing authority do um at a high level it's the library plans and operates the high voltage electric uh hba balances in real time the load in their in their area generation and the net interchange to the imports and exports with other neighboring ba's um so here's a map at the right here showing uh several dozen va's across the western united states i think it depends on how you count it but it's uh in the 30-some range and just highlighting a few notable ones here uh you can see uh bpat on the map which is bonneville uh pac west there in southwest oregon you can see and then uh call out also the big line green there in the middle of the map is pack east then pge of course around portland and then i've also noted here uh to our south of course the teal colored ciso being the california iso so where do rtos currently operate um seven currently operating across the country rtos are isos and for today's purposes we'll say they're and kind of across those three major major buckets or functions each one operates stay ahead in real-time energy markets there are significant variations as i mentioned earlier on the capacity side and that's true certainly of rtos as well a big variety in terms of how rtos are involved in capacity planning and procurement and maintaining resource adequacy and then on transmission uh more similarities in terms of each centrally operating and optimizing transmission monitoring open access and then a quick note here just a little more background on bilateral transactions because you will hear a lot about bilateral market or the bilateral system that we have today in oregon in the northwest just like it sounds really it's a an agreement between a willing buyer and seller to exchange electricity or energy capacity or grid services and it really is the dominant um form of transaction in vertically integrated markets that lack rto energy uh so just that's a little bit of background and then i will turn it over to commissioner tawny to walk through some of the more recent evolutions in terms of programs that are that are evolving across the west in recent years thanks adam and many of you in this in this group are involved in these initiatives so um by no means the the expert but um just for folks that aren't following it quite as closely uh you saw the big white space in the west for rtos in that white space there's a whole variety of initiatives in progress or or already stood up so the first that i want to cover is the existing western imbalance market it was launched in 2014 and you can see all the participants in what was that white space across the west this is built out of the california iso and it trades it it optimizes the generation on the sub hourly basis so for those thinking about the comparison to the bilateral market this has really trades that might have happened in um in the 15 minute or five minute sort of space in less than an hour and it's grown quite extensively and continues to grow i chair the ein body of state regulators which is the western regulator's way of state interests in the california iso conversations around the eim that's brought a lot of benefit because it's optimized the dispatch on that sub hourly basis so we've gotten a lot of fuel cost savings and a lot of value around being able to absorb california solar on a sub-hourly basis and and sending hydro and other resources on a sub-hourly basis it's really built more been able to integrate more renewables around the west on that sub hourly basis let's go to the next slide so the kaiso is thinking about how to move from eim from the sub-hourly basis to the day-ahead basis so we would start to to move from doing a optimization on just that 15 and five minutes to planning a day ahead right now every va does that plan independently if we got to a day ahead market in that california kaiso across the west we would optimize day ahead there'll be a next week to launch that conversation across the west many of the participants in this committee will be at that and many of the utilities all of the utilities in oregon are engaged in that conversation in one way or another has a big market on the eastern interconnect so kind of a very thin bridge between the western interconnect all the white and the west and the eastern interconnect spp is working across that bridge on the east side of the interconnect they have a full rto you see that in the light red spaces but in um in the west on our side of the interconnect they have established an imbalanced market so again sub hourly optimizing for those utilities same idea as what we have with the eim and the california iso but a different set of utilities involved here at this point primarily public power is involved in that uh although i know there is a conversation on the east side of the interconnect about how that might evolve and grow ftp has been really clear as have some of the participants in the weiss that they want to move to a full rto by 2024 and so they're in the process of running an effort to migrate that imbalanced market not just to a day ahead but all the way to a full i think there's uh it'll be interesting to see how that process unfolds uh what final governance looks like and so on there's a lot of conversations in both of those ongoing initiatives about what governance will look like and how regional it will be let's go on to the next slide in addition northwest power pool has been establishing what's called a resource adequacy program and i apologize for those of you who are the ones actually building this and deeply involved in it because as i make a make a hash of it but uh essentially where the eim and and edm is talking about optimizing uh transactions and and dispatch on a day ahead or a or a sub hourly basis or that's what fct's weiss is doing today this is looking at the seven month ahead to three year ahead and asking are we resource adequate do we have enough resources does everybody have enough resources to meet the needs of the of the whole region the northwest power pool name makes it sound like it's just here in oregon washington montana etc it's not it's got very large footprint across all of the west and so the resource adequacy program is western resource adequate adequacy program wrap and that is in the process of just getting stood up and we'll see how it continues to evolve and it is but not unprecedented to have your ra your resource adequacy conversation in a different place than your rto kaiso does it that way erica sort of does it that way but i think because of how resource adequacy is handled in california it makes it very difficult to sort of take the california ra model and spread it across the west and so then we have the rest of the west saying how could we do ra for ourselves and the way that works for us really exciting potentially a lot of benefits for customers around optimizing how much generation we build during this transition that we don't over build but we don't under build really important governance questions that are that are in uh in discussion right now again around how folks are represented and who's at the table when decisions are made around this program because it will have really substantial impacts on um how prices are are formed for long-term contracts um and how transmission",

choose the better and decide where we want take this community and this organization and the support that they will be able to provide us to the boss in the future he hasn't had a command staff complete for almost a year So this It's a very exciting consolidation and I'm just very excited to be able to pass this on to the boss so we can present the two candidates or the deputy chief Thank you very much thank you for the time to talk today like the Sir, it's not a very exciting time. for the police department for our community for the promotion of police department we do not pass to through a competitive process rigorous and good we could really see and go through this whole process of competitive selection that included advisors and the organizational plan many members and Good we really have the way to see this works we have uh the Deputy Chief Brandon said he was in the department for 17 years and its assignment is going to be specifically like the SUV your boss of staff for the department internal investigations administration and accreditation of the agency is very very familiar with the department and we also have in the part and we also have the deputy chief Kevin and many of you can recognize our work foot And I who was and was the face public department for many years Trevi has served over 19 years in the laws on police in California and well he came back to Oregon to be in Salem and he is his last task was in the divisions as commander and at level State and we have these two positions so important for us that also We have Jacob Burke who is ours. third party in charge of the division of investigations we have a new executive team that is part of the team of Leadership I am very excited that we have this group of the right people we are very excited about the progress we love you welcome and we want to give you a loud loud applause If you would also like to take a moment to talk about boss melon Where he is he is there with us in the in the corner skip Thank you for all your service one of the reasons why we have a a space here it's because a long term member of our department miles retired retired on Thursday Then they definitely Let's do your retirement ceremony Thank you very much for your service of 25 years one of the most lengths that I remember in the department and that notably we have a level of executive leadership that was the head for more than ten years of the operations division and saw many emergency responses many things complex incidents in many years and For me as a boss for two and a half years been an invaluable asset with a institutional knowledge and has helped in the transition of this organization so Thank you very much we will miss you Thank you for all your years of service thanks thanks boss Congratulations to the bosses and congratulations to Chief Miller Many congratulations also on your retirement someone else no if there are any comments of some norda advisor advisor and Norda councilor and thank you very much mayor Goodnight everyone library advisory board Salem public is accepting applications I know it doesn't sound very much but the future leaders of they leave they go and probably have been born here Ana having grown up Here they are going to become our future leaders so so much encouragement to everyone especially the kids out there who feel like they don't belong that this is one of the many opportunities out there that build his Leadership skills and a I was once on the commission youth advisors come out that it is a distinct entity no longer exists but I It helped a lot to inspire my passion for public service So I think There are opportunities out there for young people to start sharing participate in government to start get involved then it seems like it's something very small but that's how things go they start what we can see in our information report is that we have a request from our committee planning our commission planning is requesting a fund energy probability study renewable at the Salem airport and I'm really want to support No to advisory committee and it is a big change for the airport that really the town in the one I grew up is growing highly And that can give you a lot of commercial support to Salem this type of airport So the planning commission is a group that is, he sees and dedicates a lot of time to see these documents a a package of documents much much larger than the what do I have here So this request I think it is well founded doing a little research on energy renewable for the airport makes me This makes a lot of sense for me on a personal note. I recently celebrated my birthday 78 year old father has been a lawyer and small business owner who they go out for more than 50 years so happy birthday dad thank you very much counselor someone else counselor berni Many thank you thank you a couple of things I would like to mention in the west of comes out has a new mural in the street and is on the corner of King Wood and the Second and it is wonderful it is very nice it has a circular river we have salmon swimming in it it has roses and it also has butterflies So I would like to thank very much for the subsidy of a thousand for the society of and to property and artist association Cristian kunt Stephanie giuliano and everyone To make this possible the association of neighbors too the counselor stape Pluto I were the revelation last Thursday in the capital state park and there a marker is a marker and the content shows the history and Oregon ratification of the amendment nineteen that allowed women to vote in the country and it is and I was surprised and it was wonderful to see How persistent was it for the Oregonians took six intentions to for women to achieve their rights voting in Horago in Oregon the first time was in ",

        "text": " IGA and this month we have our friends and partners from the city um I'm gonna turn it over to them in a second and they will introduce themselves we are getting very very close uh working very hard on language in the IGS known as Diane said we're going to get you both draft igas in time to review before your October 11th board learning session so we're excited for that so with that I'm going to let uh Dan and uh start the process so okay uh good morning thank you for having us my name is Dan Weinheimer I'm the assistant city manager in Beaverton and part of my portfolio is covering uh Public Works and Community Development that's part of at least why I'm here moral support welcome hi Adam Jeff hunsaker I'm the city engineer for the City of Beaverton and I do want to point out some of our other team members that have joined us today we have Susan Cole and Tyler staff from our finance department and then Jocelyn Blake our CIP program manager who is also our more than adequate facilitator for the entire uh process through this that we've been doing for the last year or so I could add a little color Clean Water Services has a CIP has had but we as Washington County are just putting together our first ever comprehensive CIP and so we on the board have had the opportunity to learn it's one thing to have your CIP and manage it over time it's another thing to construct one brand new so we're we've I feel like we're earning our CIP merit badges pretty darn well so thank you for helping us on our journey and being great partners of course yay Beaverton right um so I don't know I guess the next slide please oh you guys I'm changing it oh yes Nancy awesome all right great um so I wanted to start this morning by sharing actually our city council's um strategic goals and priorities that they have um and they're up here on the screen but this IGA really ties into three of the Strategic goals for us very well good government quality infrastructure and environmental sustainability I'd like to say it also helps with Community wellness and fun but there's very few of us that finds who are going to be fun these days so it's okay not true not true but while the Strategic goals are meant to be much more foundational and long-term our Council priorities are set on two-year windows and they're meant to be more fluid over time with what the needs of the council are as the council changes or is the needs of our city changes and while the IGA doesn't necessarily tie into any of these directly it does really help us achieve those priorities especially in things like safe stream rates or housing or good government so I really wanted to talk about that and how that all ties together as well and why are we updating the IGA now the current IGA we've had since 2004 it could have been re-upped for another five years at that point it would have had to have been renegotiated but the city requested to do the renegotiation now and why did we do that um you know there's been some changes at the city since 2004 obviously um a big one for us was the voter approved creation of our urban renewal that's really put a major focus on Redevelopment especially in our downtown core for the last decade and that takes a lot of time and resources and kind of ways of doing things with working in the built environment when we're talking about infrastructure that already exists and redeveloping pieces at a time to make sure that it all works together um another but outside of Redevelopment we also have our Greenfield development as well in 2015 the City Annex the South Cooper Mountain Area about 540 acres and that's being built out right now and the city is also looking at the expansion into Cooper Mountain we're doing a community plan infrastructure plan for that area right now that's an additional 1200 acres north of that South Cooper Mountain area but really the biggest change for us recently has been our city Charter change where we went from a strong mayor former government to a council manager Oklahoma government that's been a big change obviously for our city council but also us as staff as we've been focused more on an emphasis on our administrative processes and the details on how we do our work as we're being led by a city manager now so why update it now ultimately the city is looking for flexibility and autonomy within our Partnerships to make sure that we're still able to meet those goals and priorities that our Council sets but also make sure that the goals of our partners um are able to be met through our staff kind of developed a negotiation framework and we worked with our city council to get that approved as part of this process and we really put our negotiation topics into four major buckets or categories um the first the memorialization of operating and maintenance procedures we've had a great operations and maintenance staff on both sides that have been doing a lot of things over the years to make us more efficient like swapping out this area is actually more efficient for us to maintain the pipes over here and you can do the pipes over here and we kind of do swaps we do it also with like street sweeping in certain areas and that's just been great work that's been done by our own M teams for a long time and we really want to memorialize that and get that into the IGA that they have that ability to still do that with some checks and balances to make sure that it's staying a fair and equal trade um we also talked a lot about our operating procedures and most of that didn't land in the IGA itself but through our additional documents we have that do our relation that speak to our relationship and how we work together and an example that did end up in the IGA though is um changing how we deal with disagreements and the step-by-step progression on that in the IGA in the past it kind of just said go and pay if staff didn't agree it kind of what just went straight to the the mayor and the chair and it's like well there's we should have some more steps on there and through the process we also talked about our development and Engineering standards and we worked a lot with um Bob and his team to have alternative approaches be a way that we could handle meeting the development requirements in the permit while still being unique and flexible and how we can handle them in certain areas like our downtown that's more of a built environment and it's harder for us to go with the standard detention ponds and a light of facilities that we'd like to see in our Greenfield areas it's harder to do that sometimes that builds environment where you have limited land and opportunities and so developing that alternative approaches has been big for us and then lastly we obviously wanted to look at rates and charges with just the idea that we just wanted everything to be fair and transparent between the two having Regional fees or Regional rates and local rates that are split out so obviously we all pay the regional rate but CWS that was working through their rates and charges right now and we are in agreement with the idea of a retail rate and then a local rate that's paid by the County residents and for the unincorporated areas and then a local rate that's bib return presence that we set for our areas um I'd also like to add that holistically right now in the city our city manager is really asking us to look at fees and rates and charges um as we deal with our own fiscal sustainability um and so making sure that we're getting recouped or Services we provide as well has been a big part of this so even though we don't have the IGA signed yet there actually has been a lot of great successes in our point of view up to this point um really the first is that development of a strong peer relationship we've been having some lunches together we've been having a lot of great meetings that have been actually kind of fun you wouldn't expect an IGA discussion to be fun but like we had a really good time working with each other and we kind of had some Icebreaker questions that became kind of the talk of both sides so that's been a big part of this and really we focused on that first before we really dove into all the topics and I think that was great we also feel a good success is CWS staff have a better understanding something uniquely be rooted initiatives um on the screen here I kind of just threw up a quick Beaverton City Limits which you can kind of sort of see with the orange outline and obviously our city limits are a bit bananas um is a good way to describe um and this is actually from our stormwater master plan and then all the black lines to the different stormwater basins that are in the city so you can kind of see how the physical nature of the system and how gravity works it just doesn't really like to agree with our boundaries and so that's a big issue for us is as this infrastructure goes in and out of Washington County and Beaverton and how do we work together for that um another big success again with Bob and his team we had a really strong communication and partnership during the recent update to the mpdes permit we had some listening sessions where we were able to share some information with Bob and his team kind of providing that more City perspective and how we think about things and they were able to explain why certain things are the way they are in the permit and I think that was a really great success and led to some changes in the permit that Bob really fought for that I think has gone me to that flexibility that we were talking about and then the last one is just a clear definition of ownership of Maintenance responsibility the old IGA really only spoke to maintenance and that one is really going to speak to both ownership and maintenance and it just makes it clear for us especially as the system gets older and really we're to the point of having to do Replacements of things and the ownership's the big part of that replacement whereas you know it's kind of like are you renting it or who's who's really responsible for replacing these pipes so that's been a big success I think that we've gotten that cleared up um progress we've been meeting for over a year and we've been drafting a whole new IGA since May with a smaller team from that so it's",

        "text": " home built now however there was concern that building to the new code would make things more expensive than it would be to rebuild the exact same existing structure and so there was a decision made to allow folks under house bill 2289 to rebuild structures at the code the building code that was in place in 2008 and so with that move made there was also a conversation at that same table to figure out well how could we incentivize people to build to the current code so that their new homes would be as efficient as other new homes we know this saves people money on their bills in the long run and it's better for the environment and so there's a win-win there so the decision was made that perhaps there could be an incentive program at the oregon department of uh that would support rebuilding and what happened is um the bill house bill 2289 did not contain that provision but at the very end of session there's always a bill that passes we call it the christmas tree bill at the capitol and it includes lots of different funding for lots of different projects and sure enough in that bill there was a 10 million give to the oregon department of energy and that money it should be going to energy efficiency uh in rebuilding after the wildfires and so that's the instruction we got as an agency and we've been working since then to put together a program that meets that conversation on how do we help people build back more efficiently than they might have otherwise under house bill so with that i'll pass it over to andy who can talk a little bit about the program design since the bill has passed and we've been working on it as the agency thank you christy our focus in in this effort is on wildfire recovery meeting code driving economic recovery and really incentivizing energy efficiency our program budgets should roughly the percent of structures destroyed and it's it's it's worth noting that uh single family and multi and sorry manufactured homes are about 94 of the structures lost with commercial and multi-family being about six percent we recognize that building types have have varying needs single-family and manufactured homes for example they require different considerations from each other and different from small and large commercial and multi-family we really want to offer a simple and streamlined delivery that utilizes existing systems and really we want to meet the needs of survivors stakeholders in local our goal with the program is to create and maintain alignment with state and community stakeholders as much as we can and in doing that equity will continue to be a major driver of the design and implementation of the and as we're doing today oregon department of energy really wants to utilize the public process as much as possible to inform our decisions next slide please so odo's staff has done quite a bit of research on the rebuilding and structures lost with these fires at its core this this program is here to support the the nearly 4 500 structures that are being rebuilt with a focus on uh building efficient energy efficient communities and and offering long-term affordability and as michael said the the total number of structures destroyed certainly exceeds five thousand but we're choosing to focus on the the residential and commercial buildings and not necessarily on the outbuildings transmission towers and a variety of other structures that were lost this program is funded through june 30th 2023 the end of the biennium to date around 25 of the structures have been rebuilt or or in the process of local jurisdiction we've taken a look at uh comparable wildfire rebuilding efforts and studies coming from california using those as a guidepost we estimate about 40 of the structures will be rebuilt or or in the construction process by the time this funding ends and i'll turn it back to michael thank you andy so as as christy was saying uh a lot of the legislation was designed around establishing that that when people rebuild they can rebuild to what the code was in effect in january 2008 on both the residential and commercial so we've certainly taken a look at that and said okay well what's the difference if we get people to build what the code is right now in 2021 is there significant energy savings and there are if you just look at a single family home built to what the code was in effect which is actually the 2005 residential specialty code to what it is in 2021 there's about 30 to 35 percent increase in energy efficiency which is which is awesome i mean that means long-term uh better affordability long-term energy savings off your electricity your natural gas bill whatever fuel you're using to heat your home and and we want to make sure we're trying to make homes more affordable and rebuild these communities as really resilient as we can and so we're certainly taking a look at are there is there a program that we can do to support people in doing that we certainly we recognize that market practices have changed from 2008 lighting has gotten better a lot of appliances have improved so there's efficiency gains and just those kind of market practice changes and builders are constantly improving and doing a better job which is awesome but even then there is still significant energy savings and we want to take advantage of that so design a program that helps people do that and helps them just build that current code and we certainly recognize as uh as annie pointed out that this is economic recovery that we want to do our best to try to offset some of the costs that people face and try to help them get going and uh and make the most of this and help any way we can so at that co-level support for single-family residential and commercial properties we can provide that code level support but for manufactured homes the code that manufactures that impacts manufactured homes actually comes from a hud standard and so uh we're taking a look at what are the opportunities to help people in manufactured homes so if they want to buy a new manufactured home there is a energy star or a neem standard of a more energy efficient manufactured home so we're taking a look at are there incentives available can we help people when they are purchasing a new uh manufacturer to make that energy efficiency choice can we offset some of those costs by offering incentives we have heard from the manufacturer home community that many people can't afford to purchase a new manufactured home are purchasing previously owned manufactured homes or that the new ones they purchase still have kind of inefficient heating systems and so one option would be us to do a heat pump replacement program and offer that to wildfire recovery uh people who own manufactured homes whether it's a previously owned or a new manufactured could we provide incentives enough incentives to offset all or most if not all of those costs in combination with utility programs to get them a new heat pump or ductless heat pump or whatever makes the most sense for their their manufactured home and can we offset some of those costs and make them more comfortable lower their electricity and uh and and just make the home more affordable and more comfortable over ideally we love getting people to code but if we can get people a little bit above code we're looking at that as well so beyond manufactured homes are there is there a program or incentives we can offer people at that home level or commercial level can we encourage them to build a little bit more more energy efficiently take advantage of utility programs are there incentives that we can offer in combination with utilities that are attractive enough and offset after those costs uh and offer and the energy savings over the life of that home to really make it attractive and so we are looking at are there incentives we can offer above code as well and there's a number of avenues to do that but ideally we'd like to use existing systems use existing utility programs do that whether it's energizer oregon or your local community owned utility so i talked about kind of incentives and what we've take a look at as far as what how we can help people um but in kind of framing that we're trying to look at what are the costs to rebuild and so we work with um oregon's building codes division on figuring out what are the uh extra costs and if you could build to that previous code but just building to our new 2021 code what are on an average home what are the costs looking like and so it looks to be about five to six and a half thousand dollars to incur those additional costs to build the 2021 code and so keeping that in mind making sure we can offer incentives enough to offset as much of that as we can and if we can offset a portion of that is there maybe a low income low to moderate income bonus or uh additional incentive offer that we could and cover all all that uh additional costs and so we're kind of taking a look at that and we'd love to be back on uh people's thoughts on that what they're seeing and certainly as people are rebuilding are they seeing these costs do these numbers match this five to six and a half thousand dollars is that what they're seeing we know materials uh their material shortages the price of lumber has certainly gone up and we'd love feedback on um if these numbers match what your experiences are and so i'll pause for just a second to see if we get any hands i don't see any michael okay thanks christy all right so to kind of reiterate some of our design elements that i've talked about so wanting to rebuild to our current code certainly we we know there's a variety of different building types that andy talked about from single family residential a commercial multi-family manufactured homes we're trying to create something a program that works for everybody and can help everybody across the board so how can we help people at the base level getting them to code how can we help people in manufactured homes and then is there a way that we can help even people go beyond code go even more energy efficient and take advantage of long-term affordability and that resilience that offers but in looking at kind of our entire incentive bucket we want to focus the most on getting people to code and helping people in manufactured homes when we've done some community outreach when we've talked to people we've really found that or what we've heard is that those are the people who need it the most and so we'd love additional feedback today if people have additional things to add but that's what we're really focused on um at this point and so now that i've kind of wrapped up our program i'd like to turn it over to andy bolton from dcbs",

Equity to try to guide uh considerations to guide the work that we do in the district here this District funds a specific list of projects that were identified by the Board of Commissioners in 2011 as a part of the planning for the north Bethany um community and the projects are delivered by the land use and transportation Capital project services division um and as with all of our projects that we do in our department we seek to uh ensure that we're providing good language support for our public information and public Community engagement we seek to ensure that we have Contracting opportunities of available for minority and women-owned emerging small businesses or mwb firms and then firms that are certified through the certification office for business inclusion and diversity or covid so trying to help ensure that the funds are making their way to firms that um will help increase uh diversity and inclusion in the construction community and then finally uh all of our projects generally will include pedestrian and Andor biking improvements and in those we have excess curb ramps and so again we have an obligation to provide a system that is accessible to all members of our community and that's another way that we help do that the community uh uh on the projects that are identified in this uh particular District that are on Transit of course we also provide Transit stop amenities when we um construct improvements on those roadways and we do that work in conjunction with our partners at tret so this map shows the north Bethany area which is the blue area on the map the larger gray area is what's known as the Bethany Community Plan area that's a specific area that's identified in our um Community planning and land use uh documents and the north Bethany sub area is one component of that larger U Bethany Community Plan the north Bethany District itself is generally bounded by Springville Road on the South 185th Avenue on the west the urban growth boundary and and uh in some areas the mtma county line on the North and East um I'll note that the uh Portland Community College Rock Creek campus is included in the in this area the area known as Arbor Oaks is not it was an earlier Urban growth boundary expansion that was not included in the north Bethany Community plan so I mentioned the board identified a list of projects that were to be um in part by this County Service District back in 2011 as a part of that Community planning process there were 14 Road improvements identified at that time 12 of them are eligible for Public Funding we uh at the time were assuming about a 20 or even a 20 plus year buildout of this community the intent was for revenues to ACR to the district over time and the funding sources uh I'll touch on sort of briefly here but I think it's a good good piece of background the transportation development tax is a countywide uh system development charge essentially that is collected um all across Washington County including within the cities when uh building permits are issued for development that will increase the amount of traffic uh on the road system within North Bethany the funding strategy included the creation of a specific transportation system development charge works very much like the tdt but it's collected only in the north Bethany area uh it's about 34s of the total amount of the tdt and um it is in addition to the tdt so development in this area is essentially paying two Transportation development charges uh there was a commitment made by the board in 2011 for a a fixed amount about $10 million of major streets Transportation Improvement program or MSP funds that money has been spent some time ago so we've worked through that uh component of the funding trust an agency is a very small amount that's money that may be collected from a developer who is unable to complete a required Improvement at the time they developed their subdivision but they deposit those funds with the county and we'll keep it in the bank until we're able to use it to help fund that um Improvement and then finally the north Bethany County Service District for roads um itself it is a special tax District it's good time to change slides here uh it is a specific property tax District that was created by the voters within the district back in 2011 and it also helps to fund the improvements uh within this um Community here the permanent property tax rate for the district was established at $125 per ,000 of assessed property value and I'm sorry I should have said at the beginning too you can feel free to um interrupt if you have any clarifying questions along along the way so don't don't hesitate this chart just briefly gives a quick snapshot of the actual Service District property tax revenues over time so if you understand that this was a uh essentially a a largely Green Field development it was mostly Farmland uh back when the district was created in 2011 so you can see the property tax generated in that area was quite low based on that do25 per thousand assessed uh or U tax rate and you can see it ramped up fairly quickly as all that new development was happening and the tax roll has been growing pretty significantly what we're seeing right now in the last couple of years there the the two lighter blue bars is that the growth rate is slowing down but it still continues but the community is nearing its um expected buildout I'll touch on that on a on an upcoming slide as well but we will continue to generate a fairly robust amount and we anticipate it will be at least a $1.2 million annual revenue from the property uh tax um over time this chart again looking back over the life of the district it shows the mix of the different revenues that I described earlier and you can see they vary quite a bit over time uh in this chart the dark blue at the bottom of each of those bars is the property tax so you can see that it's been climbing over the years the orange represents that North Bethany transportation system development charge that's specific to this area the gray is the transportation tax and then the uh light blue at the top is not apologies it's not included in the legend but that was the msti funds and so that $10 uh rather $10 million msti commitment actually was received and expended over a period of years what is the yellow um just curious that I believe oh that was our trust and agency uh yeah that was also kind of a one-time expenditure we had collected some revenue for a specific need and and expended it in that year 1718 uh this slide I'm a picture person uh tables full of numbers don't don't really help me much uh but I think this is just a useful tool to just sort of describe how all of those Revenue sources are tied together and how that translates into to actually building projects so the revenues received from those different funding sources that I mentioned earlier are collected and housed in various funds in the in the uh budget and then we essentially transfer those funds into the north Bethany County Service District for roads budget fund which is fund 2115 in the budget and then we also are collecting the property tax revenues the district generates are being deposited in the budget fund for the service District as well we pull those resources and then when we actually go to start uh designing and building a project we uh what we call house the project if you will uh for costing purposes in the north Bethany um Service District budget fund and then we actually expend the project revenues from that fund just a little bit about the status of the area I mentioned we had assumed about 20 or 20 plus years for the future buildout of the community we're about 11 years in and we're already almost 90% built out in terms of anticipated uh development density so there was an assumption about of around 4,200 units was kind of the middle point of a range of estimated units uh if we if we Benchmark against that median number of assumed potential units we're at about 88% uh build out out there um and so you can see we've we've been moving fairly quickly the blue on this slide indicates Parcels where a building permit has been issued for development and the orange Parcels are the few remaining Parcels where there has not been a land use uh entitlement granted at this point likewise this is a picture of the roads that I mentioned there were 12 streets that are eligible for Public Funding in this list uh that was adopted by the board back in 2011 this gives you a little bit of a status update and it's a kind of busy map so I'll just explain very quickly here the solid lines the solid black lines represent projects that have already been completed um and the red I'll call them dotted lines are projects where funding has been committed and we're actually in the process of delivering a project Improvement and you can see the to our uh Springville Road and a portion of Kaiser Road just north of Springville Road the projects that have the sort of yellow highlight those are projects that have been actually completed uh by the county and I do want to",

        "text": " projects it's definitely more extensive so if we're going to widen the street a good organ house so that's something Courtney will be spelling out I mean when we get there I think it's a little early still I I my preference is when it's getting really close because loose connection to the purpose of the um my favorite example right now Court Street to me it's happening 10 years from when we had the central Salem Mobility plan and we're delivering on things continue to know that it's not really when it's we're told so usually we'll try to keep that tighter to um I'm thinking more about the immediate projects that that space perspective and also on top of that so yeah it's kind of serious just yeah but we're going to get more grounded I didn't expect a complete answer yeah we had an intentional way of engaging people who couldn't be affected by a probably are the first project that's going to be up in terms of one like that is the progressed just given the fact that we have other friends we were perceived and it's you know so far so there will be I'm sure an opportunity on the progress we've had a lot of Engagement public engagement on it already the good news is we have a design anonymous exclusively package for a second sure great as soon as the fire trucks purchase order is done we will put out another release about how we're closer to getting this fire station to the fire trucks and we'll be able to articulate when you should start to see them and things like that it'll still be again pretty long lag but before we see that but we'll do that um mayor boy had a great idea for keeping the bond Venture fresh right after it passed and so we did a series of really short videos I think they all came out pretty good um I don't know if all of them are out yet but um little short videos about the key projects that we were delivering we were intentionally like Ryan said trying to feature big things that people would recognize in each of the awards or at least before I've seen already we need a link on Me on the on site I didn't see them on the bond page I went back to see if there were any more besides before I think okay um but they might be you know because we've been doing a lot of things but I'll make sure thanks John thanks I'll make sure they're crossed on um and then the other thing you know Ryan's was mentioning kind of the biggest and the most amount of work that we're going to be doing around Outreach and engagement is about individual projects but what I hope we're able to do we're really good at engaging people that are affected immediately in the area what I'm hoping to do is really sort of raise the profile of some of these bigger projects because they have like Pringle for example I mean it has so much more of an impact to the community and it also shows that we're delivering on those commitment and so we're hoping we can do more bigger messaging around those projects like the course two-way was one of those I was talking to that like we need to you know sure engage the property owners rare but this is a community-wide thing because everybody's downtown right and also sometimes you know even our celebrity seal work is something that we do annually and it impacts people in that immediate area but it also is a way to say hey we're doing something you know it may not be right in front of you but we are still taking care of having that message and then when we get into the projects themselves we do signage all around them we use project brought to you by we do all of that too you know this is a really big deal right for all of us with communities in this year this moment in the next 10 years as we're delivering on these things it's likely that we'll have a whole bunch of new folks who have no idea that we as a so it's going to be really important to speak that message and we'll always have is this the brand that is the brand it's on our website yeah so everything everything will have that branding on it um it's you know it is so many things it's smart to get into one brand so that's why you see a lot of different in the brand but we'll also just have a base level message about this Bond was approved in this year and how much it is a single um tagline but generally right now I've been chunking it a bit to get this Bond sales message out and we till it's fine only towards them and then when the PO comes back on the fire truck so we'll talk again if you guys have ideas or suggestions thank you for noticing that fun videos right on the page those kinds of things are always really welcome and useful because sometimes we get so busy forget about it little things so that kind of information Chief thank you talk to us about uh sir our equipment first I just want to say thank you uh for all of your leadership throughout this and uh the fire department they are very appreciative of knowing that they're going to get a complete uh it's going to be a little obviously to get them but they are very excited so this is just want to make sure that thanks to start um I'm going to pass around a couple of photo albums one's an engine and one so there are two different things one's an engine one's a ladder product those are currently being built appears manufacturing plant these are trucks yeah already these are trucks we ordered last year before the bond passed because we're worried about this really are it's our trucks these are our trucks yeah these are Salem fire trucks um one inch in one ladder uh we'll get them sometime in June if they're not part of the bond but I just wanted to show you this is what we've ordered we've ordered 16 engines two ladder trucks one heavy rescue one air raid two ylm type 3 uh y1 engines to medic units and an arc trap for a total of an 18 million 844 000.42 which will be making 100 repayments on uh later this month uh within a couple of days probably that saved us over a million dollars in uh uh the interest because we prepaid everything we have performance bonds from the company uh that are a very reputable company uh they are uh the dealer is based out of Eugene so they uh I think the chamber was when we talked with them they were very happy that that was a local business yeah within the valley so even though they're made in there are no manufacturers um so uh that's where we are on that uh we've got a few other pieces of equipment to order we've got the bulk of the equipment ordered uh of the trucks ordered we are working on the equipment that goes along with the trucks as well over the next uh 16 months um our our apparatus begins to arrive in August of 24. August September October November we'll have both lighter trucks and all 16 engines here on site that's from the bonds the bond the bond uh and the heavy rescue and the air Rick will be in May of 25 so there's a quite a delay in the time you ordered you build it especially if you're specialized Vehicles like that um and these the engines that I just showed you the ladder will be here probably June July so I think a few days after uh we or made this order then I suddenly hear this news story about all these uh local cities that have historical electric fire trucks here and I know that we've had this conversation many times but I think it's been helpful as absolutely talk about that a little bit and just let people know where you're uh where you think that the whole concept is so the uh what I would say is uh I believe they're beta right now they're not ready for prime time um if you look at the trucking industry there they're talking about electric think there are a few of them on the road at this point um because it's not reliable and for us being able to get there on time we run our trucks many hours a day we're over 24 hours a day the electric fire trucks that are on the market right now are about twice as expensive so for as an example these fire agents were about 700 000 a piece 750 for a diesel engine uh the electrics are 1.2 to 1.4 could be electric fire trucks still have a diesel engine they do yeah there's only hybrids they're hybrids and so the battery runs for about two hours and then the diesel motor in the back turns on and then you run diesel until it charges the battery back up um so you're really running you're running the hybrid so you're paying twice as much for a um some of the some of the LA bought one that it's not even in service yet they've had a lot of issues with it peers does build one the uh they sold one to Portland Portland bought one haven't got it yet um and I think there's some delays on that and then um the other issue that I think and they won't sell you a fleet effect they will sell you one drop and I've had manufactured something we will not cellulose because it's not Dependable enough to be run as complete so I think it's I think they're a little premature at this point I think if if they can get the design or the truck will run longer than two hours on the battery uh the battery is more sustainable uh you know we're running this Fleet uh we'll be running almost 18 years get rid of it you know is it a fabric in the last 18 years probably not so there's a lot of unanswered questions I think um but it in the future I think they're going to continue to develop as foreseen I mean look at passenger cars they've come a long way uh in their length of travel and how efficient they are and all those kind of things uh fire trucks are just like I said they're just Bangles right now so we my recommendation was if you go with the diesel fleetness by this is that with the number of calls we're running you know we may be looking at different places linked in less than 18 years 15 into the average so we're constantly watching what's in what's in the the field um one of the things we did do with the sleep is we've replaced all the rescue tools the jaws of life used to be gasoline Motors uh hydraulic fluid through hoses that's how they've been forever the new ones are buying are all the battery power they're faster they're cheaper they're less weight uh they cut open and closed very",

        "text": " lot. And so, I mean, there's an extreme need. I wish I had as many people come out and speak as we did at the PNZ hearing. It's just, it's harder to make this meeting the other ones after work. So this one being during the day makes it more difficult to have people attend. But if you go back and look at the record, you will see that there are many, many people did get up and say that this is, this is a necessity, I believe. Commissioner Curry? Yeah, two quick in terms of the being responsible for the road maintenance, what do you post a bond? How do you secure that? We could, I mean, we could post a bond or do a letter of credit or an escrow. One of the three. And then future growth on that site. Right now you have how many incinerators? Three. We have, yes, I believe we have three. And then the location to the south was the, was the future, was the future expansion. The other, the other ones are already there. So that would be it in terms if you got the change? That is correct. We would have to come back going forward. What is the, we would have to come back in front of you through this public hearing process if we were going to do something any different than what we've proposed. All right, thank you. And then the ingress egress. Will you stay? Well, they were looking to go in and out 163rd street and 165th Lane Road. We need to make that one. You want to be 160 5th, then let me turn in and make sure I got it right with 165th is fine. Right? Yes. So we can, we can, well, we're coming in now on 165th and then coming out 163rd. So we can, we can exit the same road that we. And then, because the houses that were shown earlier were on 163rd, they were not on 165th. So we could, we could exit 165th and enter 165. And it keeps them off of more residential roads. You got that one in as far as to the boulevard? That is correct. It would, it would take us directly over to Marion Oaks lane off of 165th. So it'd be one lady that came up. What about the kids situation? Well, they're actually. That would. They're riding out there illegally. They're riding out there legally. And, I mean, the sheriff's office really should be out there enforcing that because that's a recipe for disaster, period. They shouldn't even be doing it. They are on. They're on private property. Okay. Any other. I mean, commissioners? I'm. I mean, I'm good. I do think we need to throw up the conditions on here and walk through them real quick, please, so that we verify it. And, I mean, I do agree with David and the team that you have to have. It's better to have a place where you know where they're handling the material. Well, I did go out there and visit the site. It is run well. I think it does need to be bermed. Well, you know, all those kind of things. We need to make sure all the pieces of it. But it is much. It is much better to allow a facility to exist. It is certainly expensive, both for us and for them to run across town. If you have a lot of material in Marion Oaks burning, it is a great way to do it. I just. I think we need to have conditions that make sure the pud is locked down the best we can. No grinding is allowed to happen on site. You know, other things that could cause disruption. That tree debris is the only thing that needs. That is allowed to be taken in this area. So we just need to lock it all the way down and then figure out a method, a developer's agreement or whatever it is, so that they're responsible for 165th out to the county road. Okay. And that. And they need to expand the aprons and turn to engineering standards for heavy trucks. Yes, sir. Off of the lane on to 165th. Let's let the engineers. I mean, they. I mean, that all needs to be looked at. Yeah, but. But we just need to come into a developer's agreement for you to take care of that road. This way, it's never a burden to the MSTU because you all are going to be the ones wearing and tearing it, and then. And then we don't have that debate that they took. I mean, commissioners, I remember the hearing that we had the other day where the guy was operating his grapple truck and land clearing business on the other side of Marion Oaks. He was putting debris there. But he also had that code enforcement case out in the islands. That's what happens if you don't have this. You know, and so that's why you need this. Because otherwise people just going to buy pieces of ag property somewhere back in the woods and start dumping tree debris on it. I mean, that's what we see happen. So much better to have an outlet for it and. And then we can enforce those code cases. I think even better. So. So if we can go to the conditions for item number five, I can see them up there. So can you expand? That slide is on our, in ours as well. Page 1512 of 20 113. We need to. We need to change that condition. Yeah, it should only say traffic two from the site. Not use subdivision streets except for southwest 165th street from Marion Oaks Lane to project entrance. Correct. Okay. And in there, we need that the applicant, before they get approval, shall enter in a developer's agreement with the office of the county engineer. Okay, well, the developer agreement has to come back to the board. That's fine, but we need to make sure that our engineering department goes through there. And David, you all figure out what it is exactly. So we don't have that getting torn up. And do you want them to post a bond with that developer agreement? Well, if you look at what you only have them do, that works out well in a situation like this. But when we say postal bond, we're given the three options. Escrow, letter of credit, or bond. Correct. I don't think we do escrow. I think we do letter of credit or bond. I. So let them figure that part out. Right. I'd like that resolved in 60 days. Okay, we're fine with that. We would ask the opportunity to open the. Open this facility for activity prior to that developer's agreement. But if we're not done within 60 days, and then we would be closed back down. That's fine. I mean, we don't want to necessarily take you out of operation. Yep. There'll be illegal dumping immediately. Right. And we're stopped right now? I mean, yes, we are stopped right now. We'll come back to these because of the cold case conditions and clean them up. There's still a few more conditions that need to be cleaned up. Mister Minter. A couple of things. So the staff report, which is evidence in the case, recommends denial on the basis of several incompatibilities with the comp plan or inconsistencies, and also non compatible with the surrounding area. So I have a couple of thoughts. One of them is, is the board concluding that the conditions will act to address the inconsistency issues with the comp plan. I'll make an observation regarding compatibility. This particular application, of course, is different than the compost USA we had in 2010 when I started here. Because the compost USA literally was right next door to Kinney's nursery and residential houses right across the street. Wasn't in the middle of a 2000 acre parcel like this. So that's obviously a different issue on the compatibility thing. But I do want to ask just to make sure, is there any thought at all that there would be any kind of sludge treaty on this site? No, sir. No compost if we do. No. And if we and any. I think you require special use permit for doing the spreading of like septic sludge and stuff like that. Anyway, we're not requesting that, okay. We don't have any intention. So anyway, back to my question about the comp plan issues. Do the conditions, the alternate commit conditions address those compatibility or consistency issues? You're asking that of staff? Yes. I mean, ultimately, we recognize, ultimately, it's up to the board to decide, does staff put those conditions together as an alternate? Yes. But as far as the inconsistencies with the comprehensive plan, I don't know that there would be enough conditions to mitigate the fact that it's not a compatible use by staff standards. Standards. Okay. With that being the nature of the use being industrial within a rural land area. So, you know, the ironic thing about this is that I'm thinking of compost USA again. But, you know, we're talking about the complex provisions about industrial uses, but there are certain types of uses that if this was proposed right in the middle of the urban service area, the board definitely wouldn't want it there. Well, even, interestingly enough, I mean, to be honest with you, when you look at it, I mean, obviously there's some modification issues because your recommendation would be to put it on the commerce park that's down the road. We're going to put it. Imagine burning on the by the commerce park next to dollar general and everything else, or burning against I 75 at the other suggested site. Both of those",

much diesel in this world and can we also look at how we can replace diesel with hydrogen for backup generation and other manufacturing plants that use backup thank you those are those are great questions um and so first in terms of the um of the decarbonization and certainly um one of the study requirements is that we look at um sorry i'm just going back a slide um so it asks us to identification of potential applications of renewable hydrogen oregon by and so there are a lot of things that could fall under that and so i think blending that renewable hydrogen you know into um you know a mix of for example of natural gas to go into a turbine where maybe there's 10 15 20 percent hydrogen um is is something that we'll look at as a potential application simply because that is within the universe of of possibilities for kind of that that time frame um and then second your question about backup generators and whatnot um that's also a potential application that we'll look at uh certainly there's been some interesting work done by some of the big tech companies who have huge data centers for example where backup power is critical and they've been relying on these old diesel generators for for decades and so some of them for example microsoft are looking into the possibility of hydrogen as um as that backup fuel instead so we'll certainly include that as one of those potential applications thank you thank you i don't see anything new in the chat there's some really great comments and again we'll be recording these and rebecca will have them on hand as she continues the study and jenny if you could drop my contact information into the chat that would be great this is not uh your only opportunity for feedback i mean not only are we going to have those two other workshops that i mentioned um will make my contact information available and i encourage you to reach out with any questions or comments or concerns that you might have you got it just dropped your email in the chat um i also put a reminder link to where you can find more information about the study find relevant links rebecca mentioned the biennial energy report there are links to the relevant report pieces from that page as well um sign up for future notices and we hope you stay engaged i'm not seeing any oh we just got a new question will the study analyze the most commercially viable applications for renewable hydrogen given the current regulatory that question was from evan ramsey evan thank you will uh we uh will we look at can you read that again jenny sorry yes absolutely will the study analyze the most commercially viable applications for renewable hydrogen given the current regulatory environment i think um that we should be able to do that um one of the things that the bill directed us to do was to rely on existing data to the extent possible and to provide a high level analysis and so they've asked us to look into a lot of things and so um you know the depth that we can go into all of those is thus a little bit limited but that is an important and certainly and it goes to that study requirement i believe of identification of potential applications by 2030 um and i i read that to mean um you know one not only the universe of options but what's also really most likely and part of that is going to be based on what enabling policies do we um you know what are the what are the costs where certain it becomes attractive to certain sectors kind of what's what's bubbling up in terms of for example models available for um you know heavy-duty vehicles that are hydrogen fuel cell um so uh we will be able to touch on that um probably not to um the depth that you and i would would love to have it but that's certainly going to be an important consideration of kind of where are those where are best banks for buck so to speak thanks for the buck i like that uh a new question just came in from skip is there an imperative for this initiative to sync with and support initiatives within other state entities it's not made explicit um in the bill for the study um really the the build focuses on oregon um but i would suggest it's really difficult to think about you know in in the vacuum of a single the infrastructure um would really make sense more on a regional basis and certainly that seems to be where things are moving um a number of the state um i'm sorry the um the province like for canada uh bc and some of the country strategies really talk about um hydrogen hub um approach and so um you know that that's the idea that there might be these these regional hubs that could produce hydrogen on site and that could then meet demand for a large area and then that federal infrastructure bill provides fundings for renewable hydrogen hubs regional hubs and so while to meet the requirements of this bill we're really going to try to focus the study on the context of oregon and what makes sense with our resources um you know with our electricity mix with all of that but also still keeping that view of what's happening regionally and certainly because we have california to the south and they are certainly the farthest ahead in terms of incorporating hydrogen and renewable hydrogen into their economy and we also have washington that's interested as well and so i think we would be really remiss not to address that as well in the study i don't see any new questions or some great comments again thanks for weighing in on those folks uh linda anybody with a hand up wanting say anything else no don't see any kind of hang out and give folks a few more minutes to think about it if they have any other questions or comments um oh steve johnson just asked can you show the slide with the time period for storage again please yes let me find that and steve feel free to raise your hand or add any clarifying questions to the chat if you had a question about that when rebecca finds it so many slides i believe this is the sliding question oh he said that's it that looks like a rocket ship and did you have a question about this uh slide steve um he asked if you can just discuss it so maybe go back over what it says sure so so you um so this is looking at essentially how long um a storage an energy storage medium um can um release energy and so that's going to be this access here this is the release time and it goes all the way from milliseconds up to a year and then we have the storage capacity so starting with a kilowatt hour all the way up to a terawatt hour and so what it's showing here is you know in this bottom um quadrant here we um energy storage opportunities that are both short duration so they you know really only release for very short periods of time and they don't really hold a ton of um that's not to say that there might not be really um great end uses for them but it's just short release time small capacity and so we start to get up here and then we get um batteries here and so they've got a flow battery in here also some of the lithium ion um and so this is where we start to see some of that battery storage where um we're starting to get bigger in terms of the amount of capacity that it can and also longer in terms of how long it can release and i know that there is a lot of research going on on flow batteries as opposed to lithium ion because they do have uh the potential to have a longer release time though still it's going to be kind of at least my understanding of flow battery technology right now is that it's still kind of kind of be in this area so these are again they're a little bit bigger um but still good for kind of fast bursts of you know maybe um a few hours um possibly even a whole day and then we get into this um this quadrant and this is really where we have high storage capacity we can we can store a lot of energy and we can also release it over a long time frame and so um i'm not gonna lie i do not know a lot about compressed air uh technology other than um you know nrel and others think it's kind of one of the three good options for long-duration energy storage we've also got pumped hydro in there and frankly that's where most if probably not all of our existing long-duration energy storage um is is deployed as right now in the country and so you can really um depending on the size of the installation get a lot of long duration storage from that and then also they have hydrogen in here and sometimes you'll see a graphic like this that includes with hydrogen kind of other what are called electrolytic fuels and so those might be um electrolytic methane or ammonia great thanks rebecca i'm hoping that steve will let us know if he has any follow-up questions we've got a new question from nico although the end goal is zev's how do to liquid fuel technologies play a role for drop in fuels for all grandfathered in vehicles equipment that use gasoline and diesel so how do gas how do gas to liquid fuel technologies play a role you know that's a great question and i think that from what i'm understanding and again i'm um you know still relatively new to um what's going on with the marine and aviation sectors in terms of uh what might be the decarbonized fuel that works there um but certainly there's a lot of discussion around the role that um you know especially very low carbon intensity biofuels and then electrolytic fuels these synthetic fuels that we use electricity to produce including hydrogen but not only hydrogen and the role that they might play and so my understanding is is that for some of biofuels um and maybe some of the electrolytic fuels but not hydrogen are likely what we're going to see for example in aviation certainly um you may have seen headlines about some small four-seater planes that are electric and those are cool but we're really probably not going to see an electric 747 what we're likely going to see is um you know some kind of um biofuel created from a biogas or from some other pathway or from the electro to fuel that and that might also happen with some of the larger marine vessels an electric 747 would",

        "text": " join and then maybe if there's special circumstances otherwise but how often do you think we'll be able to see I would hope every every month I mean it might be every other month but I'd like to be here every month Especially since one of the things that was mentioned I think in the letter was updates um Council updates and so I think going for a whole quarter is kind of a long stretch of time well that's great I really appreciate Keith yeah thanks Dylan uh Council of Barney thanks for thanks for being here and for uh jumping into this role I think from my perspective where I think uh spread could benefit most uh from from having this liaison position back and forth is having those updates from Council right knowing uh some more insights on what council has been discussing relative to parks and trees um and and where scrabs uh role in kind of bringing forward some additional thoughts and perspectives could be uh most helpful uh and so I think that's that's kind of the other pieces right the content that's being discussed but then also a little bit of of guidance uh from you on where uh where we can best fulfill our role uh as as advisors and advocates for the parks uh to to city council okay okay and that would also include uh in my role on the budget committee as well as other committees where I'm getting in information and advocating for parks of course too yeah absolutely and I think that's something that that we don't have the insights on right is all particularly all of the committee discussions that are happening and where Parks might uh might pop up um and and my hope is that uh we can we can know more about where where counselors are encountering encountering parks in their discussions and and uh be able to be a resource right that we can have the knowledge that we need to have which is part of what we're doing with with some of these material developments and some of the additional engagement with with staff but then um know where we can where we can deploy that knowledge uh and the information that we have from uh from the public about parks okay that makes sense I would build on that just a little bit too Keith is that um ideally we want to see a bigger influx of information coming into spread through some of the community outreach we're going to do a neighborhood associations and hopefully having hopefully having more and more folks show up for Testimony as we kind of get the word out there and I think what that means is that on one hand There's an opportunity to address some parks issues more directly by folks talking directly and then going through City staff but then as issues escalate or if there's smaller things that maybe become bigger things then you'll now have the opportunity to hear about those and potentially flag it on on the city council level especially as we start to see Trends um and so that'll be really nice because I think as you might remember from your own time on sprad when our when our testimony goes in as letters and such it's usually just lumped into the rest of the city of the rest of the testimony that you all receive which is fairly large packet and so I think um noting that if there's certain cases where sprab is is particularly vocal on an issue or feels very strongly that you know you can understand more of the context of why that is and some of the conversations that have gone into that and perhaps that way then would be recognized and counsel as you know this is there's there's all the public comment but also noting you know as an Advisory Board this is where sprad was coming from and I think being that truly that liaison and that even just to share that context with Council will be really helpful okay no that that makes a lot of I'm very interested in these two kind of the Direction with the uh kind of Park facilities with the two developments I think that's going to be really interesting to watch moving forward does anyone else want to share some ideas for counselor Barney of what you would like to see from the role just like to say thank you for coming back and getting in touch with us Mickey this is a really good thing to do and I'm going to be rebuilding some bridges with our neighborhood association so that'll go all right thank you all right well thank you let me see I I would think yeah I I I'm particularly encouraged uh on having a person who's so knowledgeable about spread but also has such a passion for Parks but also I'm encouraged about the new organizational alignment of parks and I think I think your position would just fit just perfectly with with this new alignment so I'm I'm very encouraged about that well thank you yeah I'm really encouraged about it too uh with our Deputy managers and just the restructuring I I think it will be very very good and I encourage all of you to get involved in well finance budget and the future discussions about Revenue absolutely uh Mickey one thing that uh Council of Arnie one thing that comes to my mind is there was there's the conversation right now about processes for permitting and where tree removals as you know has been a topic and where that's going in the process of going through the land or how it goes through the land use commission versus sprab Etc and so as those conversations have continued one of the things we've been trying to continue to elevate every time it comes back to sprab is all we understand the desire to streamline the process and and ideally make that closer or earlier in the process is just making sure scrab is still notified and has a voice in that and I think there's different ways that we can continue to raise that ourselves but having you be aware of that conversation I think is important and some of the things we talked about is just making sure notices come out to spread with enough time for us to have a meeting first so we can maybe make a recommendation one way or another or if there's public comment period during things during land use appeals that may include trees that we have perhaps a little bit more time than the average um it's just how neighborhood associations get five minutes instead of three minutes Etc maybe sprad gets a little bit more time to raise a voice as an advisory commission so that is an ongoing conversation but I think it's one that has been a little bit timely in the last couple months and as it eventually kind of makes its way through Council it'd be good for you to be aware of that yeah I agree with you um I'm thinking you know the larger plans the tree what plans that they have and then uh sometimes these things come through to the council just as in you know on the consent agenda because it's already been gone through the Planning Commission and I do specifically read anything on trees and I can certainly reach out to you you all and let you know when something's coming up on the agenda that just kind of because it does it sets off a flag when when I see it wonderful thank you anything else folks would like to raise well we have counselor Varney here okay hearing nothing but thank you so much counselor I really appreciate your time and I look forward to seeing more of you well thank you and and as I said good to see all of you and I think I'll hang out for a little bit longer if that's okay with you yeah um oh one quick thing before I got off I wanted to ask um I think I'm gonna have to ask when you discuss things that are going to be brought up before Council if it has anything to do with land use things especially I have to be really careful and and duck out of the out of the meeting just wanted to let you know okay wonderful okay all right thank you so much we'll continue now with board member updates are there any other updates folks would like to share about work you've been doing or anything else yeah um at the last meeting um you uh asked Al and I if we could put together some recommendations for staff and so we put our heads together which is kind of scary thought and uh we came up with a couple a couple things first of all we did not we definitely want this to happen but we did not want it to have to be on a monthly basis um you know that would put a little bit too much stress on us you know we got to find somebody we got to find somebody um but as they come up you know and I I have a Ella and I both have a couple people that we would were very impressed with when we went dead went on our Infamous tour and um but uh you know we don't we would like this to be whenever we notice somebody doing uh an exemplary job to be able to um recognize them and so uh how would this recognition look like uh we thought of a certificate um it could be a generic certificate or it could be uh stylized uh you know anybody can make a certificate on their computer so you know we uh it could be stylized uh with some identifiable reasons uh or it can be just a generic one it's uh that's something that Al and I didn't always agree on but that's a a certificate I think would be appropriate some recognition of this person to city um in terms and I don't know I don't know how all that works um but uh it conveyed in some way shape or form to city council would be a good idea uh if we could get it on your website somewhere on the website uh the thought that would be appropriate and then also um an article to uh to our media uh the estatesman uh the Salem reporter Salem weekly uh whatever but some type of an article that we could send to them they seem to be looking for local uh stories uh especially as Statesman Journal which is downsized incredibly and if we just were to give them an article I think we'd probably have a good good chance of getting it published but these are just some ideas um I think that we can um uh all most of them or all of them I think we should be able to uh implement and but we're open to other ideas from anybody else it's a great ideas thank you so much Rick and Al I really appreciate you putting through so much time and thought into that Joan I saw your hand was up yeah I just wanted to mention the Salem connections um that brought up the website but that would be a good place to put it I think there's a newsletter it's a really good idea and so just to make sure I understand correctly Rick you're saying it would not necessarily be monthly",

        "text": " under scrutiny so a few years back uh community members requested um and argued that because our uh rules for development concerning natural resources were not clear and objective um they were out of compliance with Goal five so um the county could not enforce those protective measures on development projects in the urban unincorporated area so as a result we adopted some regulations in 2020 for the urban and rural areas uh of unincorporated Washington County to address this but they were appealed to Luba oops sorry as we began our work on making the rules clear and objective um they were also found to be out of compliance with Goal five by the land use conservation and development um commission and they put a uh in place an enforcement order on us uh directing the county to amend its regulations So currently there's a stay on certain development that may impact wildlife habitat which is a type of uh County Resources so here's our project schedule broken down by the various tasks within the goal five um planning process the bulk of the time has been spent on making updates to our in inventory which helps inform the other steps um which are working on the analysis and developing the local goal program the final step is the public hearings um before the Planning Commission and board of uh and this board so we have a technical advisory committee also helping with the project um with representatives from various agencies including Home Builders Association um members of the Planning Commission and interested citizens we had our last Tac meeting uh we'll have our last Tac meeting number four later this week and we've recently wrapped up the spring community forums um which will I'll talk a little bit later in this presentation and so the graphic also shows the timelines for when this community engagement was held so this map shows the urban area of Washington County the tan or gray color showing the Incorporated areas or city areas and the blue and orange areas encom encompassing the urban unincorporated area within the urban growth boundary the blue areas are what we call the refinement area and that's where we're doing the bulk of our inventory work um a mapping and Analysis and uh the original areas uh the orange areas or the new community planning areas are where the city has cities have done glob go five planning work and except for the north Bethany area and the Bonnie slope West area where the county did the comprehensive planning for these Urban unincorporated areas so here's looking at how the our mapping um process worked we took the um the county and Metro inventory Maps um for the significant natural areas for the Bethany area um an unincorporated Area North of Highway 26 that's seen a lot of development over the past 40 years the County's significant natural resources map is on the left with the water related habitat you can see in blue and the green areas um are shown the or wildlife habitat areas are shown in the green areas the metro map is done is on the right that's their go five uh the go five um metro map the resources um are called uh Upland habitat and those are shown in green and riparian habitat shown in blue um one of the differences about the metro map it was done in 2005 um or early 2000s excuse me and it includes kind a qualitative assessment of the of the habitat which is a bit different from our our mapping and it also used more recent um GIS technology which we didn't have in the early 1980s when the original Maps were done so we're the so therefore the Metro maps are a little bit more um we believe they're a little bit more accurate um based on on that and uh on that information and we took those um through the updated process we took those maps and Consolidated them into one map of riparian and Upland habitat T So after combining both the metro and the county inventory maps of the natural resources we'll have this Consolidated version of the Bethany area that you can see on this map and it shows the natural resources called riparian habitat in blue and the area of Upland habitat in this map um are those treed areas often further away a bit further away from the raran areas and they're shown in shades of yellow and orange um on this graphic so the LA the latest inventory REM refinement step um um we're taking um is based on the community input we're removing areas that are on with the goal of always looking at what areas are still considered significant and so we're removing developed areas or whether the habitat patches are very small and or whether the sites have already gone through a a development review process and um also um and and have received um Clean Water Services regulations already and so then we're doing uh con we are conducted a manual review and data and data cleanup and for um those new ug Urban growth boundary expansion areas we're taking the city um the city data has helped inform the process for those Urban um growth boundary expansion areas using their mapping because they did the comprehensive planning for those areas before you move away from that slide um just trying to intently follow you did you one more time repeat the significance of combining the county map and metro map and then and was the goal to just consolidate of the epin versus the riparian did I hear you say Don yes so um we had done an original inventory in the early 1980s and it it included water resources and wildlife habitat and then in 2005 um Metro did another inventory and they they looked at the those same type of resources within the urban for the whole region and that was to comply with um the administra state administrative rules they created this inventory and the county um the county needs to comply with the where the Metro has mapped where Metro has mapped the regional resources for riparian habitat and we did we adopted their map as well so we were working with two maps which got very confusing for the development Community we had our county map and we we had metros map so one of the goals was to combine those maps with the most updated information so we'd have just one map that to reference and for for the development Community to follow thank you one question too so it I hope it's on point but it might sound a little strange I looked at those three Maps you know metros which is more modern our old in this comine it appears that some land no longer is is I guess a sensitive area so those are freed up for development and other areas now are encumbered by some designation does the county ever have to worry about it taking by doing these Maps over and over and somebody says well I bought that parcel land thinking I could develop it and all of a sudden you're telling me it's repairing land I can't develop on it and so you this is modern I mean I bought this five years ago and now you're doing this is that a taking or maybe I something you want to talk about off yeah let's talk about that offline because that's a complicated subject yeah kind of this is really the inventory and identifying where the resources are so that first step is not necessarily A taking because it's just where are these where where are these resources look located and it it kind of depends on what the regulations end up being in that that conversation okay we have some we had some of the same conversation Roy about taking when we're talking about the habitat conservation plan and our Timberland and about people who had bought their property bazillion years ago and all the Timbers now grown up and they can't cut it when they planned on cutting that building there now they can't do it habat conservation areas so yeah that that this taking thing is is a big deal maybe at some point for the entire board Brad you might want to come back if they're interested I just think you don't want us to adopt something and then find that you got a 100 lawsuits and you say how do we get here I have full confidence that our legal council can and will bring us appropriate executive SS yeah I do too but I think it's good other than just me so one thing about the the riparian habitat is well we've we've been referencing that was excuse me we've been referencing that I don't know I'm apologize um we've I don't have my phone down here either um so we've been referencing the riparian habitat and that's the area that clean water services regulates and so that's a that's we're keeping those regulations the same for for for those areas we're just we're just kind of putting it on our map and acknowledging that those those locations your next slide shows that I think very well so yeah so our um so looking at um moving on to the draft code Concepts our habitat is kind of generally considered where a plant or animal e e habitat boundary which makes up the raring and the Upland areas the county had regulations for natural resources but they weren't clear and objective these updated regulations must be clear and objective and I'll follow up more on the next few slides but for the riparian habitat the draft regulations are similar to our current requirements now development strictly limited near the streams and stream Banks and the water related resources and are subject to the Clean Water Services requirements for the Upland wildlife habitat the draft regulations will not change any of the allowed uses and they'll focus on tree retention and so the code concept is to use our tree protection as a measures of protecting those habitat areas having trouble moving to the next slide thank you so as we started to consider regulations for the natural resources areas we um turn to the idea of adding requirements that focused on retaining and replacing trees when development occurs as many of you who um who might live nearby tree uh by these natural resources areas trees provide important habitat for wildlife and serve also other benefits to us as well they clean our air and water and support our well-being trees are a foundational species wherever trees are planted wildlife and other plants flourish and are used by many different species so the regulations that we're proposing will apply to the urban unincorporated areas where there's mapped significant habitat on the property and it's an activity um that is that impacts the habitat like building removing trees grading or dividing the land so these actions are considered development and similar to our current rules riping habitat would be subject to a higher level of protection in the urban unincorporated areas development strictly limited but some development activities are allowed and if a development impacts the riparian habitat Clean Water Services requirements will likely apply and when vegetation",

do his project overview for capital power and the so thank you for your time and attention and here you go then great thanks kate i appreciate the the opportunity to speak here tonight and for those of you who were not here at the beginning my name is matt martin i'm the director of business development at capital power i'm here to talk about the nolan hills wind power project if we could skip be two slides great thank you so um in terms of an overview of what what i'll talk about here tonight i will give you a little bit of background about capital power we'll provide a brief overview of the nolan hills project i'll talk a little bit about some of the economic impacts of the project talk about the stakeholder engagement that has been ongoing for a number of years now we'll go into a little bit of detail about the impact assessments that have been done over the past few years and finally we'll we'll leave some time open for for questions at the end um as we go through the presentation you'll see some some images like this one of various facilities that capital power owns and operates this is our beaufort solar facility in north carolina that i had the pleasure of working on uh seven years ago if you skip to the next slide so capital power um we're an independent power producer we own and operate 26 facilities across the us and canada uh totaling about 6 600 megawatts we invest in renewables you'll see a number of pictures of our of our wind fleet here we also have natural gas power plants as well as a number of um pretty exciting projects going on up in the province of alberta where we're in terms of carbon offset projects that um you know we can consider ourselves kind of very proactive and moving towards a um a low-carbon footprint future so we have 870 employees across canada and the us and i think one thing that we're very proud of is for three straight years we've been named one of the world's most ethical companies by the at the sphere institute um i think what you see is what you get with us we are you know open and honest i think if you were to ask folks where we operate our projects they would agree with you which is how we get those sorts of recognition so you could skip to the next slide there'll be a map of our facilities so there's a lot of dots on here the um i think you'll see that the blue dots are our natural gas facilities we have a pretty large presence in north uh western canada where we're headquartered up in edmonton you'll see a growing presence of of green dots in the us which is all of our operating wind farms and then kind of uh throughout the us we have a number of solar facilities that we are moving the smaller dots or our development projects so you'll notice the nolan hills project in oregon is is one of the smaller dots but we do have some projects in north carolina as i showed you earlier one in operation and three in construction as we move ahead so i think the key item from this slide is just to you know we are a very diverse power producer we have thermal facilities in natural gas and coal as well as landfill gas but we are moving towards a growing renewable fleet in terms of the you know the the wind and solar facilities that you see throughout the us next slide please so uh we're here to talk about the nolan hills facility which we have a nice picture of here on the slide so this facility has been a long time uh in development so the the win the first lease on this on this project uh was signed in 2010 so almost 12 years ago the developer put together about 48 000 acres of land primarily on the cunningham sheep ranch as well as some associated neighboring and you know the first thing they do is put up a meteorological tower to measure the wind for those of you in the area there's a lot of wind facilities to the west of the project we've been measuring the wind on this site for over a decade now so we have a good idea of how windy it is and this facility when it was first proposed back in 2017 um with that notice of intent that kate talked about earlier was just a wind farm so um since that time you know we've seen the evolving um organ has evolved a little bit you're seeing more and more solar facilities popping up as well as battery storage so um since the noi was was issued we expanded the project to be a little bit bigger to include a solar facility which i'll talk about later but uh the product's up to 600 megawatts so it's that original uh that wind energy project at 340 megawatts a 260 megawatt solar facility across about 1900 acres and then a battery storage project which we'll give you a little bit more information on the project's about four miles south of echo it's entirely within umatilla county it's about 10 miles west southwest of pendleton and on the next slide you'll see a map of the area this also has a lot of dots just to give you kind of an overview all the yellow dots are the proposed wind turbines there are up to 112 of them they're scattered throughout the site mostly on the ridge tops where it's one thing you'll notice on all the all the yellow dots is that there's a lot down the south of the site and a lot in the north of the site there's a big gap in the middle and we'll get to that a little bit later but just to kind of point your attention towards that gap the the shaded yellow area is uh the 1900 acre solar area that we mentioned earlier that's primarily in the northern part of the facility and then you'll see a couple of blue dots those blue dots are our project substations which we'll show you a picture of later on but they are effectively where um we consolidate all the power on this uh via underground cables and they will all come into those blue dots but then the the substations are connected via an overhead line which is the purple line here it's about a seven mile line that connects our southern portion parcel to the northern parcel um from those that northern partial where the blue dots are you'll see two dotted lines that are leaving the facility those are our um proposed transmission lines there are two proposals we'll get to them in a little bit there's the red dotted line that heads off to the west that is the uec or umatilla electric cooperative line and then the blue line is the bonneville power administration or bpa line which we'll talk about in a minute next slide please so i mentioned that the wind component so we are proposing up to 112 wind these are all have been vetted and approved by the federal aviation they have a maximum height of 496 feet just below the 500 foot threshold uh we're currently proposing three megawatt turbines and um you know the actual turbine will will be chosen at a later date but i think what's in the proposal and in the application that you'll see is the worst case scenario the most turbans that you would have is that 112. i like to show the pictures here because it shows a win project that's at the end of and you'll see on on the on the right hand side picture you you'll see the gravel roads that lead to each of our turbines those are about 16 to 20 feet wide that's our permanent impact and then you'll see the temporary impact which is the kind of the brown soil on the on either side of that road that can be upwards of 100 feet wide that's where our equipment tracks it's where our cranes may crawl from turbine to turbine it's also typically where we bury the but this is a good picture of kind of the temporary impacts that we have to study versus the permanent impacts that we ultimately see and the picture in the um the lower left-hand corner of the slide shows kind of what a site may look like when it's been restored and you'll see you know crops are able to be grown right up against the side of of those roads next slide please so on the solar component we decided to add a fairly large solar facility to the project couple years back it's covers up to 1900 acres you know the number here the 816 000 solar modules each one of those uh rectangles that you see in the picture is a module and so that is likely that's the highest that we expect to install that's based upon kind of older technology modules have gotten you know higher wattage over the year so we do expect to install fewer of them but they will be installed within that 1900 acre footprint and so the solar facility will be connected directly to the battery storage system so if you could slip skip to the next slide please it'll be located in a kind of a central area within the within the site this is a kind of a generic picture of what we call a battery energy storage system or a best uh effectively this is a lot of batteries compiled into all stacked up next to each other in a big c can or almost like a this kind of a trucking container that you would see on the side of the road there will be many of these kind of stacked up next to each other and the reason we have elected to pursue the the battery proposal is many folks have no renewable energy the wind doesn't always blow the solar is not always shining sun's not always shining this will allow us to deploy energy you know in the evenings or in the night time when it when it may be next slide please just a quick overview of some of the other components of a facility this i like this picture it's a wind farm in illinois that we recently i mentioned the two blue dots earlier the project substations on the bottom portion of this slide of the picture you'll see that's a single substation all of our electricity is is consolidated via underground wires which will all go into a big substation that looks like what you see here and then the voltage of of our electricity is stepped up to a higher voltage and will leave the site on an power line and you can kind of see that overhead power line leaving",

        "text": " go if we we cut that back so and i know i saw several questions coming through about match requirements and so that's kind of related um where the only the only type of project that requires match is if you're constructing a renewable energy only project with no resilience features and in that case we can provide 50 funding but i think the first round we're planning to go all or nothing and james you can chime in if you have a different idea that sounds good um so we still have a bunch more questions and it's ten o'clock right now um i know i can stay on and work through some of them i don't know if james and rob can i know some people will need to leave but i'm happy to just sit here and work through these um as long as the questions came in by 1001 we'll answer them but please if you could if you could um i put the email address up here on this screen so if you have questions you haven't put them in the chat yet just go ahead and email the question and then we'll get back to you that way because um i have to draw the line somewhere i guess um okay so let's see um the slide deck will be available we'll post it on our web page after this um i went down to see how many questions we had left and now i'm having to go back okay um so one of the checklist items is a documentation of feasibility consultation with a related electric utility do we have a specific form or expectation of what that should look or include well it could include a few different for a construction grant having evidence of a of an interconnection application being submitted and or approved would certainly let the competitive review committee see that you've been consulting with the for a planning grant the intention of submitting an interconnection agreement and perhaps evidence of email or phone call communications with the utility especially for the planning grants we didn't want to saddle that process with a lot of letters from external stakeholders that may be hard to get and so we're not requiring a letter from the but um some evidence that the the interconnection process has has been initiated is really what we're looking i think in the uh the construction uh opportunity announcements as well there's a little more detail in there about what it might contain as well um just to the point that rob wade about really looking for a little more detail in my construction applications as well and the next question is how will applications be reviewed um we are doing a to a multi-part process for this the bill requires a competitive review we're going to use an external review team for part of this we'll also do a couple of reviews internally completeness making sure the application's um complete and the project's eligible before we move it on having the competitive review team look at it or the external reviews team look at it we'll also do a technical feasibility study um inside the agency so there'll be a lot of different review steps that happen i know there's a question further down about if we have like a scoring rubric and we do and i'm wondering if it's uh the scoring criteria is in the opportunity announcements for each of them so that's how that will be competitively made so that that form will be used throughout that process and it's what we'll be grading on um we'll be sending around information on how to join the review external review committee and working to put that review committee ahead of the july 8th deadline um obviously you're here because you're interested in applying for the program so you probably don't want to be on it but um because we want people that are that will have conflict of interest but um let's see in conduit hydroelectric qualify as energy resilience or renewable energy only so in conduit hydro good qualify as resilience you know again within the competitive review process um it's going to be competing against presumably projects that are um you know using some renewable including inconduit hydro and storage with the idea that it can provide backup power in the event of an of an emergency in conduit hydro which is not going to be running during the winter months might not score as well as a project that can provide backup power 24 7 365 but that doesn't mean that it couldn't couldn't be providing some resilience value so again within the within the competitive review um the review committee is going to consider how that project can be available for supporting a community in the event of a power outage um michaela has a question that i think is best answered by just sharing the definition we have for resilience for this it comes from the bill she was wondering if it includes more holistic economic resilience not super sure what that means but maybe our definition would be helpful one of you could summarize that for us the resilience talk specifically specifically about community energy so we can uh and we have definitions for those in um so we can kind of uh put those in i think the bottom line is it's sort of like um uh how does it help the power to how does it help provide power during an outage kind of stuff it's like in that services in like an event of a power outage or natural disaster or something yeah yeah exactly the bill says community energy resilience project means a community renewable energy project that includes utilizing one or more renewable energy systems to support the energy resilience of structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare and so that really is about the critical infrastructure and supporting energy um and you know the energy resilience i would say that the economic resilience is something that you could put in kind of the community benefits section of the application however most applications that we get we expect to have economic benefits rippling through the communities so if there's one that really distinguishes those economic benefits to say a qualifying community that would be worth putting in the but the resilience piece is really about backup power um i'm sort of confused by the next question let me see if he's still josh claussen will you raise your hand if i can take you off mute and then if you raise your hand i'll ask you a question but otherwise i don't i don't know okay perfect okay thanks all right sorry that i oh no i lost you you are now unmuted i hope yeah oh no i i need a darn person okay now try josh you should be off meet now so my question was um as we are applying for these grant applications what are the uh the criteria for final acceptance basically you know we don't want to get into a position where we've gone through all these steps you know uh accepted the 30 grant and then we're into a problem where we don't qualify for the the last 70 and but we've already already spent those those funds to to get that project underway and so we'd just like to see if there's a way we get that published where we'll know what the what the final criteria for acceptance are before you before we begin the project performance oh go ahead i mean i know performance agreements are like kind of the the avenue or the venue where this will take place right oh yeah but like on on solar applications and what and whatnot um you know there's there's different govern governing agencies that are going to be involved with the final performance checks on these on these systems whatever whatever you know they end up being as far as the scope and we just want to be sure that you know we can check all these all the boxes off and say okay we are we are now ready for you know final acceptance uh from ode and uh have some have some idea that we are are ready to go are you referring to planning or construction grants uh probably construction grants so i think the uh one of the requirements is going to be that uh cpa verification letter uh along in the final report um as well you kind of detail that a lot of the other ones will be specified in the performance and i'm just going to check a few other places if rob you won't have add anything to that yeah um so during during the construction phase of projects we will have periodic reporting requirements with odo staff so that we can keep up to date with how the project is going and one example of something that could happen would be the need for an extension of time and the bill gives us the ability to do once so that we can provide an extension at the final stage of a construction project we will have an on-site and we'll be looking for a fully operational project that is demonstrating that it is um online exporting power to the grid or using you know having power used on site it's essentially a fully operational system that can pass our on-site okay and we'll be working with you throughout the project with periodic reporting requirements for progress checks within the within the do you uh i don't know if you can even answer this right now but do you foresee a time when uh let's say the local authorities having jurisdiction approve a project but oregon state will have a higher higher acceptance application i mean uh criteria for for this acceptance where you know i'm just saying like maybe maybe oregon is going to say we we need this bill to a better standard than what you've done but your your local inspectors have have passed it so the only case where our requirements exceed the local code and the local jurisdiction is for shading requirements on solar you know the local jurisdiction and the would allow anyone to install solar in the shade or on the north side of a roof because it's still electrically safe um our program would not approve a project that was putting a system in a low resource area but the local jurisdiction once they sign off on it as having met the local code requirements we don't have any requirements beyond the local sign off by the jurisdiction and the utility as far as technical requirements go so no we don't have we don't have beyond code requirements beyond the the solar resource or the wind resource perfect thank you you're on mute christy my next door neighbors landscapers are here so timing so i'm having to deal with that now um so um the next couple i think i can buzz through so that's exciting um one of them is um our matching funds are requirement they are not uh just to confirm a project uh in iou territory could qualify yes that's they just can't apply pge impact uh the slide deck yes will be available um there's uh i guess when we were talking about definition of rural um tomas endicott shared and usda's definition and i think is probably part of the suite of options that",

        "text": " just want to get back to your question about next steps here and and say that I agree with with what both Kelly and Martina put in the chat I think Odo is a natural convener in this um and that I I do want to just highlight that there are other opportunities beyond the hydrogen Hub like if we go back to the infrastructure investment in jobs act there's section 11401 grants um that's something Oda as an agency is is heavily focused on obviously it's Transportation focused but we're going to be looking for partners and looking to uh generate some Grant Concepts there so having some sort of communication among all stakeholders uh in the state to to just start having these conversations about potential grant opportunities and how we can work together and partner um would be great and I think if if Odo can can lead that effort we would certainly welcome that and also just add back to my other comment too about if if they do release this hydrogen Hub funding in multiple rounds that's a natural Next Step as well as how can we be more prepared for that second round of funding so that's something we can continue to work on in the interim has his hand raised so let's try it again Thomas see if we can hear in here all right hopefully this is more perfect sounds great okay okay thank you I just wanted to elaborate on on the comment about Transportation um I know that over the last couple years there's been some Focus here um I know Clean Cities did a really good webinar about a little less than a year ago with all the transit agencies from Oregon and Washington um I know that the you know what's near term what's available right now is transit buses in maybe the next five years there may be heavy duty Tran uh Transportation Freight um and the recently at the at the gtsc meeting in Tacoma there was a panel that you know Kenworth paccar which is in Washington Daimler which is here in um Navistar and Volvo were on that um on that panel and they talked about a little bit about hydrogen um and uh Daimler in particular mentioned that they are talking they are partnered with black and Veach and nextera energy to develop fueling sites along corridors we're all familiar with you know alternative field corridors through the navi program and and whatnot and they said that they were looking at developing you know uh battery megawatt charging uh uh sites with hydrogen so you know when you look at that and and the volume you know that could be consumed by heavy duty Freight especially along I-5 could could get big you know over over time um so so I just want to I'm just kind of surprised that there's not representation from transit that could be near-term you know uh in involved from from the heavy duty Freight especially that they're given that they're in the region and there was also some talk about the um you know benefit of talking about connecting to the California Hub along I-5 with heavy duty Freight and you know that could be a benefit maybe to the application so I just wanted to add those couple of points thank you hey Rebecca can I ask a follow-up question of Thomas when you were talking I'm taking notes and and I may have misheard something so I just want to clarify are they did you say that daimler's interested in putting in battery charging stations that are fueled by hydrogen or putting in hydrogen fueling stations to support vehicles running up and down I-5 what they said is that they are looking at pairing both uh electric charging stations for battery Freight and hydrogen fueling for fuel cell Freight great thanks appreciate it one other comment too that I just now that I'm thinking about it Maritime transportation is huge right and I'm sure there's no question I think there's maybe at least one Ferry that's that's hydrogen powered now built in Washington so you know there is connectivity too with the Columbia river between you know Puget Sound and and Oregon so um I don't know where the focus is with the different Maritime groups but that doesn't Maritime Transportation doesn't seem to be represented on the executive board either thanks Thomas Thanks for the clarification too appreciate it uh Kelly added a comment in the chat Rebecca I really welcome the focus on low carbon hydrogen at eweb we're really focused on defining our interest in the types of hydrogen projects that are of highest value to our interests it would be helpful to have some of those discussions at the state level to ensure that the federal and state Investments being made on hydrogen actually lead to accomplishments of achieving a low-carbon Futures but it is possible uh to get the urgency of climate change I say this because I want to be careful that we are applying projects and funding to the highest leverage projects that can address climate change thank you Kelly and I think that speaks you know to the point that Jessica made earlier that you know that that you know if if Oregon were to develop a Statewide energy strategy then that would definitely be a conversation that we would want to have in terms of what you know can can the state agree upon what approach it wants to take um you know should you know should there be intermediate steps with um with you know low carbon hydrogen or or maybe that's just one of the the two paths or should the focus be only on um on renewable hydrogen you know I've heard a lot of um arguments you know for both either or so you know I I agree that that's that that's an area where I think that there's you know a lot more discussion that should happen in Oregon kind of you know to come to some consensus about you know what what we as the state Define as as the best and highest use only the lower carbon hydrogen is going to qualify for the production tax credit of three dollars per kilograms so another important uh piece of that yeah that's a great point oh and Kelly added to that um getting clarification on the carbon accounting to determine what is low hydrogen what what is low carbon hydrogen uh will be really important so if I'm not mistaken I think Thomas's hand is like his liar um I don't see any other hands up or any comments the chat can I actually ask a question about what you're seeing related to the carbon um you know in the three dollar kilogram you know my understanding of carbon in the utility world and as it relates to these types of projects um is that you know average emissions factors have been applied for a year on average for different utilities different electricity mixes I'm trying to figure out how you would actually get to above the 60 Cent threshold for the PTC um because it requires it to be very low and trying to understand like how you would tie a particular renewable source to a project in order to do that is that going to be just like the regular clean fuels pathway process of approving a pathway or they're going to be other carbon accounting methods that we should know about or who's who's making those decisions or do you have any insight into any of how that is playing out in terms of taking what's in that the IRA with the PTC rules and figuring out how to get to that very low carbon threshold that would get you the higher higher levels of incentive you know Kelly that's a great question and that's something that I have been trying to follow and I just haven't heard a lot of action frankly um you know I think that I think that there was a hope amongst some that uh that the federal government might adopt the direction that the EU was going in with respect to the requirements for additionality and hourly matching with respect to electricity the EU has since jettisoned that as part of their approach so I don't know if that has any bearing on what the federal government decides or not you know I know um Odo along with many of you were really concerned when we saw the infrastructure Bill and they suggested a carbon intensity only at the point of production which isn't a true carbon intensity and then I believe it was the most recent doe notice of intent with respect to the hub that they did make clear that they were actually going to look at it at a true carbon intensity but again your question with respect to you know what will that electricity matching look like will it be a grid average will it be a specific utility average will it be you know hourly Renewables will you know will Rex be allowed to demonstrate that I I have I don't know what that's shaping up to be but I think that that's going to be you know a really important area and if there's an opportunity for public comment I I would hope that that Oda we might have the the capacity to to get folks together to comment um Oregon stakeholders Rebecca we got some additional comments Thomas said also mentioned earlier about Oregon Washington California and British Columbia have clean fuel programs that with the three dollar BTC you could drive the cost of bringing hydrogen for transportation below the cost of petroleum diesel um Chris uh from Northwest Natural said for the PTC and you oh sorry people are typing as fast as I can read the carbon accounting will be based on the Greek um this is prescribed in the ira bill um Chris says for the PTC anyway and I can only imagine this would drive hub and that was followed by Evan who said the difference in the carbon intensity pathway for hydrogen incentives under the IRA is the calculation stops at the point of production whereas under the low carbon fuel standard the calculation goes to the fields of the vehicle so um it sounds like the CI pathway is is uh tailpipe instead of life cycle for the IRA and then can add a grid average power will not qualify even bpa's power so the rules are at what counts local Renewables contract Renewables tracks Etc are absolutely key when making it the treasury needs to be a bookable I see Evan's hand up is that yeah yeah I'll just elaborate a little bit and you know Kelly um you're you're right that this is a really big deal um how this is all calculated and and Ken points out that a lot of these details will come down into rulemaking um from what I've seen I I did some calculations based on um CI Pathways for Oregon utilities um there's some natural gas in the BPA mix and I was coming out with about 1.5 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of hydrogen which puts you right on the threshold of of a dollar a kilogram PTC or even down to 60 cents a kilogram PTC at that at that range so I'm",

What the guest advisor did was a email that said my client will be agree to install the fence no aac they authorized me to withdraw the appeal If your client agrees install the fence without including the trees along with payment of 35000 of 3500 Yes because I had to hire a lawyer for appeal Imagine that you would work with the applicant and if they refund me but no That's the case, they're not going to tell me refund are And well I no longer have those funds is not I'm just still sitting here I want my trees I didn't want to have to go through for all this but here we are and I don't think at this point I have to give more even more than I already said to be mioca Thank you I understand your frustration but my question Is there something preventing you from putting trees in your own yard there are more rules I can't plant anything I can't put not one bardite in the bondage No it is not possible is eight feet and then the right of road or So I go out the back door and with what mole then is eight feet from the servitude and that hallway is 109 the rest of me patio but that's the rest of your patio Thank you Okay questions from the staff can you come back we have questions for you sir I want to ask you Lord the affirmation of the lawyer who says that our code annuls that right age Yes we saw that argument and we provide our answer has eh right the standard applies to that area is also a difficulty for the applicant and the applicant saw a adjustment to the standard is being applied standard and the applicant is looking for a way to reduce or alter that standard through adjustment process I'm sorry you just responded in circles So if our code cancel this servitude and applicant is subject to code and and a the and the servants correct our code asks you to do something that is not possible Yes they are looking extension of that process because it can there is a difficulty in reaching the property and it can be argued that is fulfilling the intention of the disposition and look for some kind of extension any additional questions from the for staff Keep going with that He asks if I basically think that I already They responded to your question, thank you. I'm trying to find in the cuos How many trees are going to be planted in site this Maybe the ones can say it applicants I cannot mention that I have to mention that our code requires at least one tree per every 3000 square feet in addition to this mattress area the applicant will designing the entire landscape and complying with the minimum requirements of trees and there is something in the code I think I already know the answer but I'm going to do it the question in the code that talks about the lighting of the lighting I know we like it the heavens immense darkness I understand the concern of the inclusion of the law in that location There is something in the code that address the part of lighting if we have standards for the light poles in place And we have Limits on how much light can be used o How much light level or intensity light any questions Very good thanks it's time counterargument Thank you nu is possible to show again my presentation I want to start with the question trees planted exact but I do have a map and I think there are about 450 trees in the entire site and 3000 bushes We also have many new plants that are going to include in the site can be interrupted second staff can show the presentation Thank you if I want to respond some points appealed I guess that would be all I just want to reiterate the answer of staff on bondage AND If this applies or two sections in the code or two items in the code be I understand what I said but there is a section that talks private debts in relation to city \u200b\u200bdevelopment codes there a previous section point 005 that speaks of the Federal regulations I think it can be a more applicable rule as well since it is vp it is public it benefits the department of energy and has compliance with a greater purpose than property private then I think there is the Ask if this applies or no5 refers to this In the case of Federal regulations they prevail over the local ones. But as he said personal part of the servitude private is that the development of city \u200b\u200bdevelopment code city \u200b\u200bapplies as staff said city \u200b\u200bcode also has a process to give flexibility to city \u200b\u200brules in certain cases in In this case we are asking for an adjustment. It is the process we are following and the purpose of these settings is this situation we don't have a situation of unique development in this case since it is not allows trees and in exchange for that adjustment we offer other concessions I think with respect to the You'll see what we're going to have between the two. properties I think that this shows all these points greens basically doesn't show everything it's just the trees in proximity of the property of the one of these Well there are some things that don't We were denied But there are many trees the applicant's request then no, nothing More is a clear vision But there will be many trees and that is the theme let's say as I mentioned we are going to be planting 450 trees and many bushes can be more specific about where the trees if you can see in the image of here here uh I highlighted some of these trees yeah I'm just trying square what you said said they're going to and giving it to him. Let's see, this is the building. question is building 33 and we have some trees here that are going to be type column of 22 feet or so these two They're going to be like this screen building That's what most of the buildings are like trees the point is that there are trees between our building and the appellant or plaintiff there was a comment about or concerns about the lights of the vehicles in the parking lot the plant agreed to They addressed those concerns with placement of a barda I think the last point and I appreciate the comment said that The goal was to try to uh reach a agreement And well he wanted to be paid also for the rates for those of the lawyers the point is that also the client had expenses and also they incurred expenses to prepare us today to be here at night I think It's part of the process and that's the way How do these decisions come out in the end? of the day we are confident that we buy one that complies with the regulations and we are providing mitigation and necessary, recognizing the construction restrictions that site Thanks, I asked, do you have any other questions? concern of any other neighbor not good thanks questions for the applicant Thank you, I will close the hearing. public and we can ask questions to the staff if there are questions for him very staff well Gonz\u00e1lez is prepared to issue motion on the dissection of the grading administrator the second can I ask for clarifications includes the modification request to include the truth I assume that yes to clarify it is the recommendation of the staff with the addition of inclusion of the fence as a discussion condition comments just I would like to say that with Based on this testimony it sounds to me like the parties have essentially reached a agreement regarding the impact on the neighbor the neighbor seems that I would be satisfied with those good considerationsconsiderations financial consideration because obviously We understand the But as for the bability I think we are have reached agree I'm ready to support this just to understand that exactly what is the",

        "text": " really a ban outright it's like a practically practically abandoned um but anyway the um there were three bills that were all very similar or even identical that would have undone that statute that creates that practical ban and one of them House Bill 2215 the first one listed here had a public hearing this session and actually they had two public hearings there was enough testimony that it spilled over into another day so just wanted to flag that there was a lot of conversation about this issue in the house climate energy and environment committee this year three legislators introduced the bill came and testified in support of the bill and then there was an organ based company that also testified in support as well as other sort of interests related to the emerging field mostly of small modular nuclear reactors so there was also plenty of testimony and opposition related to environmental justice concerns for the most part I would say and then the other two bills that were in the Senate did not have hearings this session and these three bills all as we say in the capital died with that deadline that I mentioned that happened last week on the on St Patrick's Day this year there was also um a bill that would have made small modular reactors not upset jurisdictional that bill also did not have a hearing and did not move forward and then lastly there's a bill oh gosh because of the captioning I can't see my screen but I think it's thorium I've not ever said the word out loud and now I can't see it um but it's uh there was a bill that would have allowed some work on that as a nuclear power source and that bill also without a hearing did not move forward this session so that's kind of the update on all things nuclear this continues to be a perennial topic of the legislature two years ago there were hearings on bills and obviously once again this session just wanted to give that update and unless there's any questions on that topic we can move on to the next slide great so there are still citing related bills that are alive and this has been a really interesting process to see unfold this session and beforehand I know that there were some of the folks that were working on a table or we're calling it a table but it was kind of a very large group that was getting together on Friday afternoons to talk about citing citing related issues land use just a whole lot of different relevant or related topics to energy facility development or sighting and so that particular table and Coalition together introduced two bills and they're it's actually kind of funny because it's just a coincidence that the first one which is kind of out of series is the first one that that Coalition introduced as what's called a placeholder that sort of is there for them to use once everybody arrives at what a bill will look like and then oddly enough there were two other citing bills I'll tell you about in a second and then the third bill that's in that series and the fourth bill on this list 3181 is the other vehicle or placeholder bill that came from that coalition and like I said coincidentally a different uh and there was that Coalition work and then meanwhile a um LED some conversations and some work with legislators and put in two placeholders as well that just happened to be immediately preceding that that third one um and that's House Bill 3179 and house bill 3180. so all of this to say that um actually much like the clean electricity standard concept two years ago there were sort of two and actually similar folks involved there were kind of two approaches on how to move forward with that standard and there was a lot of conversation and activity happening all session long to figure out which vehicle it was going to be that's actually been very a similar a similar Dynamic has played out again but on this sighting um and kind of related energy development uh renewable energy development um conversation there's kind of different approaches and different folks working on different things which has certainly made it a challenge to track and also to kind of know what exactly is going to pop out of these many conversations on many very topics that have been happening this session um I really want to commend the staff at the sighting division um particularly Todd Cornett and uh and Wally Adams who've actually been tracking while he's been tracking this table alongside me but doing it I'm having much more expertise than me and sort of making a better listener throughout sort of the whole process and Todd and Wally for example are still somehow despite how busy everybody is making time to make sure that we're on any conversation that we get invited to for the most part on these topics so that we can be listening hearing what's going on so that we can sort of be ready to provide technical input as that's helpful to crafting legislation so despite the difficulty of tracking I think we're doing our best and kind of we're in the middle of it kind of trying to figure out where we are we're working closely with our fellow state agencies and so together we've been sort of sharing information and trying to figure out sort of approach on how we feel about these different pieces of this sort of large and frankly a little a little confusing puzzle um and as that puzzle sort of starts to be put together being ready for that so I'll share just kind of where we are what I know about each of these bills that are still alive but I will just say that I have been um there have been meetings that we've not been included in where things might have come up so there might be especially people listening to the conversation that no more than I do um and um so I just want to be really clear from the beginning and then also there's things where we kind of have a pretty good idea of what's going on so if somebody hears something they're in the audience and it's wrong I'm really sorry I'm just sort of doing my best with the information that I have and know about a topic that has had a lot of different disparate conversations so yes and I just I've tried to in my day job not my volunteer job yeah participate in as many of these conversations as possible and I can tell all of you these conversations are happening in multiple places some of them in duplicate fashion and I don't consider myself an expert in any of it either but just being able to listen and think well that's not accurate or that's not correct or just from the work that we see here for example we know there are a lot of things that have been approved through f-step that have not yet been constructed the processes are broken and worse it's not our fault and it's not and so finding tactical ways to share information or at least encourage people to is something that we can all do whether to do our own legislators our friends or whatever but I think it's important to recognize we have to find ways to participate I believe everyone's intentions are good but some folks really don't know so I just want to say thank you to you for your work um this is a fascinating time to be in the legislature with A continuous turnover the things that we have from a goal perspective to get to a zero carbon um things are happening simultaneously at the Regulatory Commission so thank you for your efforts in uh Wally Todd I see your name to those chat boxes a lot so thank you very much oh thanks I guess I should open the chat I'm on as an attendee and I'm not I guess I'm on as a panelist I don't know I can't see the chat oh sorry uh Chris I think uh chair well then on the Verde siding tables in the chat yes oh oh okay okay thank you I was like what's happening in the chat I can't see it okay I see them I know that they're participating because when we have to identify ourselves oh no no it's great thank you so much chair girl for the comments and for your um paying attention and being at these meetings too and seeing just how sort of complicated it has been to follow um so House Bill uh and that's the the sort of table process has been a little less difficult to follow it's been sort of the side conversations that have been happening that have been harder for what it's worth um because that process um I actually feel like was was like really interesting to um participate in uh house bill 2989 is one of those that I mentioned um and I turn these slides in two days ago and of course something's already changed uh we had been told house bill 2989 would become something along the lines of F6 streamlining and we've been in a lot of conversations about this um uh in the past couple of weeks and uh last we heard although again things seem to be changing quickly and without much notice we saw on amendment to this bill that just would add storage only battery storage only to upset jurisdiction for large storage projects so we have seen language on that got an email this morning that they're still working on amendments but not sure if that's beyond that topic or just sticking to that topic and amendments on that so just that looks like what that bill is so please maybe ignore my expected to become because actually maybe it's going to be something different um so that's where that bill is um House Bill 3179 was a was a placeholder bill again this is one that did not come from that Coalition process but came from a developer and working with legislators and there was a dash two Amendment on that we put in comments um on that a lot of what chair Grail said about looking at that it just seems like solution without a problem if that makes sense um to us and so we while having no position on the bills submitted some testimony and some fact sheets to help legislators understand just the good work that fsec does and sort of how different aspects of our work Stack Up in different ways the bill uh included for example if there was already Federal jurisdiction then upstec would not have jurisdiction and so um kind of talking a little bit about how Federal citing process differs from upsec process just to give an example of something in the bill and that we put a fact sheet together to help legislators understand it so at this point we're not expecting that bill to move forward and in breaking news I got overnight essentially it sounds like some pieces of that particularly related to the jurisdiction for counties on solar projects might be moving into the next bill so I will kind of see what happens on this next bill but right now House Bill 3180 I was told that it was",

        "text": "is and and i myself and my wife susan live in the fire zone for us uh the power had been off for three days and um and i had a uh an appointment with uh county commissioner katie jacobson early in the morning to come down and view the fire command center she picked me up at five in the morning and uh we were just driving down the road when her phone rang and she pulled off to the side of the road and uh and with a very uh and her face went pale on me and she turned and she said we're not going to the fire the fire's coming to you and so it was still dark the power had been off for uh for three days it was still before six o'clock in the morning and first responders were coming through my neighborhood door to door warning people that they had to go that they had to go now and we're coasties and we live in the earthquake zone so most of us have go plans we have go kits we have a strategy in place and for susan and i having a go plan saved us critical time and i believe that that for people that had go plans that was also going to save lives we had roughly 40 minutes to uh to leave now some people just had minutes to having 40 minutes in many ways is a luxury it also means that you have time to make some painful you gather your your critical belongings you implement your go plan you gather your pets make sure you have all your members of your family but you still have time to look around the house what am i going to take what am i going to leave what what photographs what what personal mementos what extra clothing do you take with you and so we had a few minutes to do that um and to load them into our two um and then we started toward the door and i will tell you that we paused for a moment and i and i reached into the sideboard and i pulled out a bottle now it's still six o'clock in the morning but i poured two glasses and susan and i toasted 30 years together in a house that had become our home and we put the glass glasses down and we went out the door not knowing what would be here when we got back we were evacuated for 10 days at the end of 10 days and we were able to get back onto highland road which had been closed off by the national guard and the local fire we found remarkably that our own house was still standing uh that the fire had come to the edge of our driveway and uh and it burned past our house on either side um susan said to us it's a miracle and i said yeah it was a miracle wearing a yellow shirt and a hard hat but a miracle nonetheless on our street about a third of the homes were lost i will add that although it doesn't really get into the statistics the same way about another third of the homes left lost either their uh their water supply or their their septic tanks because we're all on wells and septics up here over half of the houses on my street impacted and yet in other parts of otis i want to make it very very clear that we were very fortunate here other parts of the coast the fires raged through doing much more damage much more consequential damage and impacting lives in a much more serious and uh and hurtful way and altogether we lost between three and four hundred homes again that doesn't begin to uh to detail the extent of the damage or the impact on the their lives the lives of those survivors when you say gosh we lost 300 homes um and within weeks of the fire um i was called asylum for legislative session and serving on on a new special wildfire committee i was able to work on legislation that made it easier to rebuild that reduce some of the tax consequences of of rebuilding and also to put money aside for all kinds of important rebuilding efforts not the least of which was 16 million dollars that was going to go for uh for water sewer and roads here in lincoln county but also the money that you're going to be talking about later today that was going to be for uh for building back in a more energy efficient and resilient way at this point here we are over a year later um on my street of the uh of the 13 homes lost only one has been replaced in other parts of otis um i don't have any statistics at my fingertips but it's my impression that about a third of the homes have been replaced with new homes primarily manufactured homes arriving every day but we are still in the um certainly in the midst of a rebuilding i will tell you that i think everybody has got a rebuilding plan underway and they may be asking um gee we've got our plan well underway what's the department going to be able to do for us at this stage of the process and i i hope that you'll answer the question for them why are we having this meeting a year after the fires uh to talk about rebuilding when so many of us are engaged in rebuilding already but still so many people displaced so many people impacted so many people now celebrating returns to uh to their home as a community that has come together in remarkable ways helps each other with this process every new home that comes comes up the road is a is a celebration but families are still struggling i'm so impressed with how our communities have opened up their hearts their homes and their wallets to help each other but the process as i continue to emphasize even though we're a year in is still underway so i'm going to pause at this point i don't know if senator anderson's been able to join us or not but i'm looking forward to the information you're sharing and more looking forward to hearing from from the the truth survivors not just the the lucky folks like myself i hope that gives you just kind of a snapshot of what life was like that morning and what had life has been like since then as we go through this recovery effort on the thank you representative gomberg i don't believe that senator anderson has joined us at this point so maybe he could they'll join us later in the process and and uh we can hear from them christy would you like to talk about the you bats hello everyone just getting myself off camera and thank you so much for sharing representative gomberg it's so good to see you um this literally hit so close to home for you and that perspective is really important for us to hear and i appreciate you asking tough questions already i love it so house bill 2289 was a bill that representative gomberg and many other legislators representing those that were affected by the wildfires worked on together to streamline the rebuilding process make it easier on folks to rebuild versus sort of the status quo on building a new home and as part of that bill there was a provision that allowed people to rebuild to a lower code a lower building code um our in oregon we have sort of a rich tradition we're we're one of the most efficient um we have one of the most efficient building codes in the country as far as energy use and so when the decision was made to sort of lower that standard with house bill 2289 there was a discussion at the work group that what could happen instead is that there could be an incentive to um provide people so that way they could build to code and so that conversation was happening throughout session and then house bill 5006 was one of the last bills to pass during session it's a it's a traditional bill that representative gomberg knows all about as a ways and means uh leader and it's called the christmas tree bill it's just sort of all sorts of different spending that didn't pass in another bill and there was in that bill 10 million dollars for the agency to wildfire survivors both folks who lost homes and folks who lost commercial buildings so that they could not rebuild to that older code but rebuild to the current code or perhaps even above it so we um got that money and part of the reason why sir we um are talking about it now is because that bill passed in june and so we didn't have the ability or know that that program was coming um until until now and so we're having that conversation now today to make sure that we're designing a program that'll work uh for folks um so thank you so much for for raising that question and we can maybe get some of the people working more in the details on the program could share more down the road about kind of as we go on how we expect to be able to help folks who have already rebuilt to code when they've rebuilt their homes so that's essentially the story of how this this happened and it's really because of tenacious leadership from folks like representative gomberg and others who represent folks that we were able to have this funding and we'll have it as a tool to help people pay for rebuilding their homes thank you christy thank you michael thank you christy so i'll talk a little bit about our program objectives and our primary focus is on wildfire recovery meeting code driving economic recovery and incentivizing energy efficiency our program budgets should roughly follow the percent of structures destroyed and it's it's worth that single-family and manufactured homes equal about 94 percent of the total with commercial and multifamily representing about six percent of structures lost we recognize that the building types have varying needs a single-family and manufacturing homes require considerations quite different from each other and different from small and large commercial and multi-family buildings we want to offer a streamlined simple a very simple delivery utilizing existing that really meet the needs of the survivors stakeholders in the local jurisdictions where where these fires happened our goal is to create and maintain alignment with state and community stakeholders as much as we can as much as possible equity will continue to be a major driver of our program design and and related to that as we're doing today odo really wants to utilize the public process to inform decisions so oto staff have done quite a bit of on the rebuilding process and the structures that were impacted uh at its core this this program is is here to support the the nearly 4 500 structures being rebuilt with a focus on building energy efficient communities in and offering long-term affordability while the the total number of structures destroyed is uh over five thousand we're really here to focus on the residential and commercial not necessarily on",

This is a neighborhood storage center. This has no onsite buffering along the greenway. It has no adverse impact. How long has it been built? I defer to Mister London, who, excuse me, about 20 years. So we have 20 years of no adverse impact here. With no perimeter buffering, you can see there's still none to this day exists. It's paved right up to the property line, as you'll see from our plan. And we can, let's see. I think I have even the ability to change slides now. No, I don't screw it up. Well, as you can see from our plan, if we can pull, when we pull that back up, we're even attempting to alleviate any concerns with proximity of buildings, et cetera, for the structure by putting dras along that southeast boundary to really push it farther away. This has been broken up into three sections, essentially the property, the north pod the driveway section, or they're calling it the connecting strip, and then the south pod. So the north pod, if I can get this to work. Obviously you can see here what's most prominent on the screen here, which is obviously the top part of the proposed development, is adjacent to commercial, it's fronts on the highway. We're considering that a little bit differently. A little less protection is required there, because this is already a developed segment along a state highway, the connecting strip relatively thin, no development to occur on it, and so not much to buffer there. The south pod, as staffs called it, appropriately, I think, is where the concern is. And on the south pod, we have attempted to push Drasden along the boundaries here, as you can see, DRA four and five, as shown to help further buffer spatially any impacts from having buildings on site. Now, there has been some discussion with staff about maybe it'd be better to have the buildings push up to the property line to create its own buffer. And we would certainly entertain that. And this is our first we've heard of concerns today from Greenland trails. We fully intend to meet with them to address those concerns. Rearranging the site a little bit to accommodate those things is really not an issue from our perspective, as long as it works technically and the engineer can fit it on the site. However, the setback and buffering is essentially, in our estimation, a request to buffer against what, for all intents and purposes, will be nothing in perpetuity on the terminal point of the greenway through this segment. Because to continue on through this greenway, unless and until they build something under or over the intersection of Mary Camp and baseline, this is not a connecting point for like a wildlife corridor or something of that nature. This is the terminal point of the greenway. It terminates right here and it restarts on the other side of that intersection, for all intents and purposes, relating to anything wildlife related. So that's really the basis of our request here. We think it's well founded and we think it's a corroborated by the fact there's a similar use in very close proximity that has no adverse impact. So that would be our assertion. And lastly, you'll see one additional condition we added because it was raised by Mister Rison and I think thoughtfully, our PUD standards said uses allowed in the v two zoning classification. That's a broader list, it's not an all encompassing list, it's a relatively tight restrictions, but it's certainly more than what's being proposed here. So what we've added as an additional condition, or would be happy to add as an additional condition, is that if we were to change use from storage warehouses or mini storage warehouses, redevelop and change the use, that we would have to come back for a new master plan approval so that this is not a universal set of development conditions that would be applied against any use under a b two zoning. Any change in the use would require us to come back and address any site setbacks or buffering requirements to be more representative of the intended use. However, as a mini storage facility, we're going to have. It's going to be gated, it's going to be secured, it's going to be light restricted, and it's going to have extremely low traffic and no traffic, for all intents and purposes, at night. So. And from our estimation, this really does satisfy the conditions. We will pledge to certainly sit down with the representative of Greenway and trails as soon as possible to make sure that we're all on the same page, because we have not had direct communication there. But we do think that the alternative conditions proposed are appropriate. Thank you. Does anyone have any questions? Not for him. He said. Well, thank you. We'll have you come back up after we hear what opposition we have here. Got it. Thank you, sir. What is the reason all this change is coming and where do you stand on. I heard you first. You said you may work out between commissioner's meeting and this meeting. Did you thought of it, what he's saying about it, why we need a buffer? And what was your mindset at that point? Our code does require a type c buffer between commercial uses and adjoining public use properties. That's the greenway. That's also the rotary sportsplex. So that's where that. Hold on, Chris. So you're not agreeing with him at all. You want the buffer. If I understand, you couldn't because you ask everybody else the same thing. Am I correct? Am I wrong? Correct. That is a code requirement. Same situation, too is our code specifically states that the buffer requirement or setback requirement is 50ft along the greenway, for instance. So that's one of our concerns. And then in discussions with the greenway staff, they did emphasize that one of their concerns is fire is a concern and separation for species and so on. Right now, to qualify a little bit, there is actually an underpass underneath 464 and underneath baseline. That is therefore recreational trails for connections. Wildlife is able to use them now. And right now the trail that will extend from baseline down to santos has now been funded with the coming fiscal year. So they will actually be constructing that facility as well. So we do anticipate some additional usage in this region as that trail comes to fruition. So that is one of the concerns. But we do want to emphasize that our concern too is to ensure that it is up to the greenway's interest to help maintain that. And I don't know that they are. I'll phrase it as absolutely wedded to our code requirements, but they want some certain assurances. One of their questions, for instance, was, for instance, firewise plantings, not planting, as that will potentially become a fire hazard should a fire occur next door, for whatever purposes or whatever reasons. The other thing is there are structures, admittedly, most self storage facilities are metal type structures, so they are very difficult to burn, at least from the outside in. So that may actually satisfy part of their concern there. I mean, it might be a question of qualifying that. So we do think there might be some flexibility and then there may be flexibility because of that in terms of reducing some of the buffer requirements to get kind of a middle of the road situation. And if some of the buildings can be reoriented so that their rear becomes essentially a blank wall facing the surrounding properties, which they have proposed on the western boundary, that would be advantageous. And maybe some of those buffer requirements might then be scaled back, at least in terms of plantings, where instead it's like I said in the staff report, it might be stormwater tracks and essentially grasshead, and then maybe some other minimal screen. I hear you send them this proposal of your buffering just today. Well, we sent it out before the holidays, but I contacted them today to make sure that they had seen it and were aware of it and everything. Anyone else have any other questions? Does anyone here that's in favor that would like to come up of the applicant? Is anyone here in opposition of the applicant that would like to come up? In that case, if no one is, we'll bring it back to the. Did I miss somebody? I am. No, we want to bring him back. Sure. If I may chair just briefly. So Mister Fred, you heard both this? We heard both sides. You heard that side. So where do we stand now? Yes, sir, and I appreciate that. So a couple of cups. Just brief comments relating to Mister Risen's comments. One, the type c buffer code requirement. It certainly applies and is the reason why this is not a straight application for b. Two, rezoning. The purpose of a PUD is to allow flexibility in connection with uses for specific parcels where those changes, deviations from code may be appropriate. So hence why we're here with a pud plan, which as I think many of you know are well aware, is a much more cumbersome, much more expensive process to go through with the application phase. The sole reason why we are here is for the buffering along this boundary. Hold on, just hold on then that's why we have special use permit versus changing Mister guy. That is why we have Pud. The code is extremely clear. This is the purpose for the Pud, not special use permit. The special use permit is completely different process. The PUD is",

        "text": "good afternoon and thanks for joining us we'll give folks a couple minutes to get on the call now that it's 12 noon and get started around 1202. okay i'll go ahead and get us started we have one of our um staff members who is up to speak is having some technical difficulties so if things get a little awkward in a couple minutes uh just know that that's why but i can probably handle taking care of his slides until we can get them on um so thank you so much to all of you for joining us today my name is christy split and i'm the oregon department of energy's government relations i'll facilitate our conversation today and i'd want to start by thanking maputa omeu areka and eweb uh for bringing all of us oh i wrote yeah that's right eweb for bringing us all together for what i think is an exciting opportunity for oregon's communities an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can both support planning and projects a couple things i want to flag before we while the first part of this webinar is aimed at applicants and cous are eligible to apply we also want to be sure to cover what the experience could be like for utilities dealing with applications coming from within their communities so we'll make sure that after we kind of get through the slideshow we talk a little bit about that before we go into the q a i also just want to make sure um that i'm clear about the definition of resilience here from the start so um the statute itself defines resilience and it's in more of the community resilience type of framework than maybe what resilience might mean for the grid or for utilities so feel free to ask questions about this when we get to it but i just wanted to like immediately raise the flag that this is more of like those community benefits when the power is out sort of resilience benefits um that the bill the statute uses as the definition that we based our program on so um our luckily our panelist that was having technical difficulties just made it so we're going to be fine um for our time together we're going to spend about 15-20 minutes going over the program itself give an example of a project out of eugene and talk a little bit about the application process and then most of our time together will really be determined by you and the questions that you have for our program staff about the program um you can use chat to ask questions along the way and you can raise hands or chat during the q a and um for those of you who aren't as familiar with webex i just thought i'd share a little bit about how to raise your hand and how to use the chat in case that's helpful to you so you'll see that there are um you'll see that there are two ways to raise your hand and one of those ways is right at the bottom if you click on the little smiley face one of the options is to raise your hand and it's right at the very top it doesn't have an image associated with it and then you can also raise your hand if you click next to your own name under attendees and then the chat you can see you can click to everyone and enter chat message and that should be on the bottom and um right hand side of your screen so when you're done speaking or if you decide you don't want to speak because someone else may be answered your question asked your same question you can click to lower your hand in the same place as you click to raise your hand so we can test this out now if there's any questions on the plan today or how the meeting will be facilitated go ahead and raise your hand if you'd like we don't seem to have anyone on the phone um i'll keep an eye on that but there's different different ways to do that for folks on the phone too so if anyone has questions you can ask them in the chat you can um and and uh yeah and then i'll also just say um uh it'd be great if you could introduce yourselves and share what uh utility you work for in the um in the chat as a way to kind of get us started and that's definitely a good way to chat check that you're finding the chat function um and we can continue to use that if you have questions like mid presentation just go ahead and throw them in the chat and i'll make sure we ask them at an opportune moment and then um the other thing that i'll flag is um we'll use both chat and raised hands during the q and a part either one is fine whatever is more comfortable for so with that i'm going to hand things over to rob delmar and james kogel who are the certified smart people when it comes to this new program um rob you feeling ready yep sorry for the slow joint i had a login problem but i'm great well it's nice to see you all right so um thank you christy and house bill 2021 also known as the 100 clean energy for all bill establish the new community renewable energy grant program and the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing renewable energy projects and those are projects up to 20 megawatts in capacity to support projects in traditionally underserved communities to promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs next slide please one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in oregon is that it's only open to public and eligible applicants include tribes cities counties other public bodies and consumer-owned and the consumer-owned utilities are specifically called out within the the bill excludes cities over 500 000 which in oregon of course includes only portland and this was done in recognition of the portland clean energy fund which can provide funding for similar projects in or in portland next slide please another feature of the program is the focus on community energy resilience and the bill establishes carve-outs where fifty percent or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects and fifty percent or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities and we'll see more about what qualifying communities means on the next slide next slide please so qualifying communities are defined in the bill and they include communities of low-income communities tribal rural and coastal communities and other traditionally under-represented communities in oregon next slide please the bill called for an advisory committee to work with the department of energy on program design and now program implementation the committee was instrumental in kind of sharing on-ground experience with project development and this is a list of the committee all through the fall they were helping us with the rulemaking and now they're going to be helping us with outreach and um we had central lincoln pud helping us gail malcolm representing consumer-owned utilities on the committee and she was a very vocal and helpful member of the group next slide please so since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very built busy standing up the new program in the summer of 2021 auto staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan including operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency in september we recruited a stakeholder advisory group which we just saw to help guide the program design and support development of program rules and that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with secretary of state's on january 1st and those rules are now final and the opportunity announcements for the program announcing the grants came out on march 7th next slide please so we before we move on to the specific grant opportunities i'd like to walk through a project that the eugene water electric board completed a few years ago the city of eugene like much of western oregon could be subject subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake and as a utility that manages both electricity and water services eweb recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within eugene next slide please eweb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes and that was in the first three days provide access to drinking water and this is the first three days following a natural disaster in the first three weeks repower critical facilities and in the first three months complete system repairs and restore regular water and electric service next slide please as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project the project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the howard elementary school and added a battery energy storage system and a new potable water well to the site next slide the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the community in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features the school benefits from energy bill and e-web is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during regular day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of how the microgrid system is put together showing the electrical loads that can be served by the system during a power the battery storage units which are shown in black can be charged by the solar and a natural gas generator and that is assuming natural gas is available in the you know during a natural the water well and the critical loads within the school are shown in green and the switch at the main breaker near the top of the dotted line area ensures isolation from the grid and that's to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines lines during a power outage so now that the program is nearly up and the agency started to hire staff that will run the program from here pandian krishnaswami is on the line and is our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here yes my name is james cogell i'm a policy analyst for the program um so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th uh there are four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity announcements uh more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes",

        "text": " too today's all about the entire draft proposed order so um but I did want to highlight that the staff report kind of boils it down and then a presentation boils it down but we are we are moving away from that and now is this going to work it's like I'm sharing my wrong screen let me try I'm sorry guys um or folks rather I tried this too bad Tom left I feel like that's a Tom question okay good old Tom uh just as just administratively I'm trying to figure out which screen to share that then I don't have to change screens does anybody know that answer right because you have all of these and someone where you could pull up you know no okay great that's right bear with me everything's great great okay all right so presentation overview um we're just oh I also want to mention that we have uh Joe stipple from um Idaho Power the certificate holder here in the room representing the certificate um I'm really going to kind of go because a lot of this front-end overview is very similar to what I've gone over twice so you know it's it's been a long day for Council um you know and so I'm just gonna kind of go through there I also have some maps and such pulled up um so we're gonna kind of be looking at some of the facility a little bit or the the amendment a little bit closer so um I'm really just going to kind of go through the things I've already done in my introduction for instance like the approved facility I'm just gonna skip it okay oh okay thank you council members um and then so again those two those first two I'm gonna just like breeze past them and then we're gonna get in just we're just gonna get into the meat because there's some really interesting things here today um and I'm kind of excited to talk about them so um this uh again we just really want to highlight we're in the middle of the process okay we're not at a final it will come but there's more steps and notice will happen at those steps okay there's an approved facility it's a transmission line with related or supporting facilities including roads um the scope of council's review we're looking at adding areas to the site um and the amount of our bond or letter of credit now there was um you know comments raised about whether or not we can comment on site certificate conditions and it's it's and that whether that would be under trigger um you know aspect of the scope of review and it's it's kind of yes if there's modifications to conditions if it's in the DPO you can comment on it that's what the comment period is intended for um and then it you know if such then that other part of the scope of review would apply to those condition changes so this is but generally really when we're looking at the council standard you know fish and wildlife soil protection where like is does the these areas meet that standard okay we've talked about RFA one we're adding three routes um uh which together is about 8.8 miles um and then we're adding uh about 46 miles of New Roads what I really want to emphasize here is that Idaho Power is adding these as Alternatives but in the it does not mean that all of these are going to be built out it's kind of the one or the other right Idaho Power is not representing that they're going to build two transmission line routes in one area it's one or the other which kind of aligns and makes sense with whether or not we're asking ourselves well does that one route comply with say protected areas and a visual impact we're just looking at the visual impact from you know that route or this one um so so these are even though this this is they it is functionally additive the actual impacts when the it's just giving Idaho Power more options for flexibility for final design engineering needs and landowner preferences so it just really wants to reiterate that it's not all going to be built out and then there's also amendments to the site certificate we're going to talk about conditions we've already gone through this slide okay what is this um we can't even see this here in the room it's too small on my screen um this is basically a summary kind of Per County of the roads and routes I've talked to council about this um we're familiar with this slide right so this is the length of an alternative um and the corresponding um you know additional mileage if that alternative was being built instead of um the area in the approved route okay so this is the true blue Gulch alternative and then lastly we have the Durbin Quarry now here and again it's just it's not quite as helpful when we don't have a big screen folks on the webinar can probably see this but I just kind of wanted to you know I I wanted I talk about roads right like so the gray area is what was previously right and we're adding on all you know adding adding on all of these squigglies squigglies are the little roads but you can see here like this little hump that was a previously approved Road right and then we have this little we have this little road here so this little Road in the gray area that was actually a previously approved Road what is triggering this amendment is this tiny little circle that pops out of the previously approved gray area on the maps they're just showing the whole road It's associated with so you have some kind of context so it is a little bit it it does get kind of confusing um I'm just going to highlight since we're kind of looking at this one of the stop b2h comments was about confusion with maps and not being able to see all the roads now it's difficult because you don't want to illustrate in the Shaded area all of the road squigglies that were previously approved because then it makes it really hard to see what they're adding on so it is a little bit it's it is kind of it is difficult I do understand the the tendency to want to show all everything but for the sake of the clarity for the amendment the certificate holder really focused on the areas that are being added to the site boundary associated with like a previously approved Road or like an entirely New Road so um anyhow like you know for instance here here's a little teeny part that in the previously approved and then there's just this little bump out that went outside of the site boundary that really is like under review right now and move there we go okay um so we've looked at this uh since our record closed we're here reviewing uh the the DPO and comments Next Step proposed order um basically we kind of like mirrors this uh that Chevron okay and now is where I'm going to now now's where we're gonna let's get wild okay I'm gonna stop this okay and so this is where because that was the beginning of me kind of marching through the standards so now I'm going pull up Ah that's what I want I think okay all right um so council members um you know on online and in the room do you since this is kind of I'm I'm projecting this so folks on the webinar should be able to see this but does council members have their like PDF open on your computer it may okay all right it's because this is this way you'll be able because I am not I'm not going to sit here and I'm not going to read through everything right okay we're trying to just move but Council can kind of like be going through that said if you want me to stop and read through everything I can totally do that okay so um again we're just going to follow this since this is kind of in it in a table um and uh kind of outlines we start with stop b2h's comments on the um Zach sorry um but we also know that Miss Gilbert provided you know significant comments on the forest Practices Act we also had a response um from the certificate holder on the applicability of the forest practice or no it was a response from me clarifying what we had said in the final order about the forest Practices Act I'm just going to take a minute and I'm going to show Council what we said what did we say now we're going we're going back in time because we love doing that and uh so this is what the final order now I'm just pulling this up on my screen here all right so originally in one of these more obscure exhibits in the application the the certificate will then applicant requested counsel um you know find compliance with this exemption in the forest Practices Act um or like Grant this exam exemption so it kind of was buried in the application and so and so we kind of summarize what the forest Practices Act has in the final order and we say the requirements of the FPA Force Practices Act include providing notification um submitting uh a permit for power driven Machinery um submittal of um and obtaining a approval of a plan of alternate practice if the use would not meet reforestation requirements um and so that's just kind of a list of summary so now the final order if you were to go through and look up Forest Practices Act we we talk about it in the final order and it's more in the context of like the applicant talking about things that they will do right so um uh and so there is one uh aspect of one of the land use conditions that says on roads will be enforested areas will be maintained consistent with the forest Practices Act so that isn't one of your your site certificate conditions but functionally in in the final order council did not assert jurisdiction under and finding compliance with the forest Practices Act but the certificate holder nonetheless needs to comply for the applicable provisions of the four of the FPA so here's this is just a little blurb like you know we you know we we reference and we talk about it under land use and public services the context of Public Services was cut was related to a fire player in in those areas but basically Council does not assert jurisdiction of the FPA and refers the applicant to submit its request for exemption directly to odf the Oregon Department of Forestry and so here down here in this footnote making you everybody get real squinty here okay as detailed in this order the applicant recommends and Council adopts various conditions related to compliance with FPA so related to compliance with the requirements would minimize potential impacts underneath applicable Council standards but Council imposing such conditions is not intended to assume enforcement authority over those requirements but rather Council finds compliance with FPA would reduce potential impacts underneath public services or it",

        "text": " always important what do we do now they already have a protocol place um is it was previously every four years now it's every year so we concluded that there is no additional followup that's needed they recorded it timely they already have an annual protocol for testing those so for us that was sufficient to to move forward and conclude this incident okay moving on to we are currently in the short legislative session so uh we talked previously about three bills that relate to the energy facility sighting Council House Bill 415 um that proposes to add a definition of battery energy storage systems in fex definitions so as you recall we have numerous projects where the council has reviewed uh and approved battery storage but those are in conjunction with a wind or Soler or natural gas facility um so they're not by themselves so currently there is no definition of battery energy storage whether it's in FX statutes or when in conservation development commission statutes or anywhere we know there needs to be you know a lot more battery storage systems out there and the market is such that we're going to start seeing um independent ones not associated with projects so that's what this legislation is intended to start start with is to create some justification that there is a path um so what it would do is you I said put a definition in and then it would allow optin to FC um by a development that's all the battery or that's all the legislation does it doesn't clarify how at the local level it would be reviewed and approved um there's different thoughts on that but I think this is the first of probably you know a couple of different bills related to battery energy storage I don't think this will be the the end of it I think this is just the beginning of it so likely we'll see more of this at the next legis session uh next is House Bill 4090 that would eliminate have sec jurisdiction on projects that are entirely proposed on lands and then House 1525 so the bill currently is related to the Oregon Department of energy uh Portland General Electric has added a component to that bill which would allow for standby generators to be connected to the electrical grid and dispatched to the Grid in certain circumstances currently by definition a standby generator cannot be connected to the grid um it's typically would be like a data center would have a series of diesel generators that if power is lost those would K in provide power during that outage um anything that's over 25 megaw anything that is connected to the grid would not be defined as a standard stand by generator um and would have to come to FX for review this change to the bill would add a component for certain standby generators to be able to connect to the grid um and under certain circumstances would allow power they produce to be dispatched to the grid um the the bill or the that component of the bill makes reference to 40 CFR code of feder regulations 63664 subf um and I'm not going to go through that but it creates sort of emergency circumstances so power outages or brown outs or other types of situations it provide some limitation about when those standby generators could be used to dispatch power to the grid um so the bill also indicates that the generators would have to re use renewable fuels if they are available if those fuels are available and they do not impact the warranty of the generator and begining is most of the generators out there now are diesel generators so I'm not sure what the availability is to use renewable or alternative fuels in circumstances so kind of boiling it down what this would do is if you recall last month there was the big storm and there were power outages this would be in that kind of circumstances um it would effectively allow you know you know the OHSU or Intel or you know Amazon or those kind of big facilities that have those diesel generators would allow them to connect to the grid um and cumulatively it's a peer plan that's really what it is um is in those circumstances would be providing power that then the utility you know either couldn't provide or would help them in those kind of so that is thank you sy Syd for so we've done some recent work on standby generator and so will we come back well that require us to come back again to readdress that by memory um who specifically State cannot U be the or connected so we'd have to come back we have not evaluated I have not evaluated the bill language to determine whether or not that's going to require followup Ru making it pro it probably will I just not reviewed it in that context yet um and there has been some changes to it so still it's early in the session because we're pass the session the language you know wasn't part of the original bill it was added to it so um probably but we'll follow thank you um unless there's any questions on the legislation the last item that I have is the March council meeting so March 21st and 22nd uh we will need both days we have the potential for three draft posted order hearings um on Thursday evening and then we'll have probably a more typical meeting on Friday which probably should go past noon but we'll also have a r making hearing depending upon what you do today um so it'll be a pretty big meeting um based on the location of the projects we had intended to be in Boardman but there is there is no place to hold meeting on those days Boardman so and you spent a lot of time trying to figure that out um so we're going to be in Herston bu just a quick question is yeah sure we will look into that and get to in terms of timing and coordin record I say um while s Boardman as far as Katie could probably attest to this Boardman Heron it's work East and I think that's what matters so thank for the extra effort but I I don't think that's a bad thing to and Todd if I might ask you and I get it the bill is going to change not stop but would it be possible to have chrisy send us or you send us what the three language that you have I will do that by the end of the day I will send you the current bill language or unable Monday F yeah or I mean as you know sometimes you'll get like a version of the bill and then the Amendments aren't like the full bill it's just strike this at that um I'll figure out the best way certainly capable of looking to I today so don't things change I just think that that won't be a problem was that 1525 yes okay thanks even with my change in h my curiosity is still I work out as much of my new job that all you had sir that cludes my report thank you all right well always conversation and um wow we are okay agenda Item B contested case r making this is an action item for Council we have Thomas Jackman making coordinator to present to us so Tom come on over for the record the Willer and we are here to discuss the so let's get into so so I sort of have this slide here just to kind of help everybody understand where we are uh for each rle making update that we do uh you can see here we are potentially here at the pice of the notice making stage we have already done initiation we out some rules we submitted those as part of the council packet two weeks ago and what we're doing today is discussing the proposed rules and should Council agree with Ming forward who and then enter the next Spates I would submit them to C State and that would launch the formal public comment hearing and if we look forward today um just a reminder to everybody so I just checked in with Chase who's monitoring the meeting um asked him how well he could hear you and he said not that well so usual I that's just a remind and again I we're just getting adjusted to these mics fairly new so just a reminder to make sure that the mics are relatively close to you when you're speaking so again it's easy and here you can hear everybody very well it's just making sure that those on on the line and then the recording is fine up okay so next so let's uh just provide some background about what we're trying to do here as you see there are five kind areas that we consider within the objectives this making uh the person is and these are progressing through my second year real medic here for I noticed kind of pattern that we kind of some of these we kind of reorder reiz gos to better match the process updating them uniquely here to reflect option of opposite Administrative Hearings model R circum cases uh we're trying to improve the consist to do the rules both internally andely other statutes and appable law where then a big big Focus to this one as you'll see is number four which is the clarity of the rules by dividing enhancing existing various areas Cas process and then lastly we are attempting to improve the efficiency of the contesting case process by providing additional guidance to perspective parties in terms of so yeah great so in Orange there uh we have items one through four those are really intended to be essentially all clarification uh improving the participants or would be participants ability to understand cancel inves process and the intent with these four items is to not really change anything uh certainly the adoption of the uh off Min ministr he roles will introduce some sort of new uh rule language but sense of the process is not going to be altered by any of the things we're doing in the SP it will just be increased understanding increased Clarity for everybody in terms of how the process is intended to the contested case is intended to operate next slide so then we have the number five item here and there are just just a couple two or three um small sort of additional requirements these are requirements that didn't previously exist so the would be substantive changes but uh as you'll see they're fairly l in scope but the intent here is that by introducing requir participants who follow them will then have an easier time the contested case process will I next SL please so let's go through the five different changes real quick uh first of all we have sort of a reorder reorganizing this is the existing kind of rule layout for the council cons process it goes from in division 15 from rule 12 through rule 85 and you don't already know division 15 is essentially the application process which at the tail end does include the for contested case um but you'll know 12 isort of of",

General guidelines and Community Resources prior to the close of the public hearing with statements are evidence sufficient to afford that start landmarks commission and the learnings and opportunity to respond to the issue when it's appeal to the intercessary event issue a similar failure to raise constitutional issues relating to those in action for damages in Circuit Court prior to the conclusion of the human eating participant May request and the opportunity to present a discipline administer testimony to start letting my exclamation will then either continue the public hearing or leave the record open for at least seven days thank you uh are there any conflicts of interest or ex parte contracts that any commissioner would like to declare at this time yes I received a mail notice about this project because I live within uh of the project contagious you can put a factory all right thank you uh maybe we now have the staff presentation preservation officer for the City of Salem I'd like to enter the staff report its attachments and off of the testimony into the record so this property is located at 1840 Court Street Northeast and is a contributing resource to our course Chemeketa historic district here's a street view of the house and the front entry a little bit about the history so according to nomination documents the Hewitt class was constructed by Julia and Henry Schultz in 1907 and was promptly sold to James and Marin who lived in the house until 1919. the Oregon Statesman featured ads advertising a two-room furnished basement apartment beginning in 1938 and that date's important because I'll mention it um when we discuss alterations outside of the period of significance as a reference the period of significance for the abortion method I Disturbed ends in I also want to know about two Sanborn fire Insurance Maps up here and when doing historic research realized that it originally was addressed 1740 Court Street so you can see that in the 1926-1927 Sanford map where it just shows the house itself with no accessory structures and then um you can see later on in the 1950 updated map um there were two separate one-bedroom Cottages that were constructed in 1948 at the rear of the Rock and this is an interesting history this was one of the very first properties that city council considered for a ReSound from R1 to R2 because of the multiple residence residential units on this on this property um I also want to note that the previous owner turned in replaced multiple windows with vinyls throughout the house and did remove some original signing despite these alterations the resources still reported as historic contributing to the unfortunate events so these are the few pictures that we have that were submitted by the alphabet the one on the left is from 1978 and the other two we don't know what the dates are but you can see uh especially on the picture of the UFOs on the porch that was enclosed in some of the blocks so the proposal um so you can kind of see that but I'm going to go through it piece by piece so the applicant is proposing to replace windows to remodel the front porch and back porch and restore the shingles in the Dormers and then I take one facade at a time so the north facade which is the front so the existing porch decking and square post Rail and porch column are in poor condition and the applicant is proposing to replace the existing post with a new one uh replace the decking and rail all to be a little composite or previously uh the applicants are proposing to replace the front stairs the existing stairs are not original to the structure they're being cast from the b91 with railings of pressure treated lumber and the proposed new stairs will be a bit narrower six feet wide with composite with railings to match it's currently single themed and wood and the person in Windows location will be of my own and slightly different size but the applicant is proposing to add or restore the siding in this location which is currently a vertical plywood board and he's purposing to restore the the theater she moves restoring the original Canon so this location and he's also proposing to remove that metal stove phase on the western edge of the northern slope of that so on the western side which is an interior side the applicant's proposing them to replace the existing uh wood window with a new wood double paned double among window in that location and the South facade and there's a lot happening here too so as you can see the rear porch is in very poor condition um and it's not so we enclosed any longer as I mentioned when I was going over the history um best as we can tell this was uh the access to the basement apartment and so it was it's not an original to the structure and is proposing to re-impose this porch area and remove the stairs and the door and then we signed it to manage the siding on this facade the applicants also proposing to relocate the existing bathroom window uh it's a vinyl window and it's purposing to be located at 46 inches to the west of that original that existing opening uh and then the applicant is proposing to replace the basement proper Windows on this facade with new vinyl windows and also be proposing to restore the the siding in the genre area from the front and we're going to remove the stove paint and installations and last suppose the East facade which is another side facade yeah and is proposing to replace the two first floor Windows which are single pane double round uh and yeah and the basement windows as well uh to replace the two proper windows so I'm going to go through the applicable guidelines which are in Salem Revised Code 230.065 the residential use is going to be retained so um staff recommends the one workers commission find that this guideline has been met uh I'm going to take guidelines B and C together which are related to ensuring that historic distinctive teachers are preserved and repaired so I'm recommending the landmarks commission adopt two separate conditions of approval uh relating to the the decorative Square front porch post so that the applicant is is proposing to replace the square post and this is uh has character defining features that are difficult to replicate with modern materials uh and so condition one uh staff is recommending The Landmark solution adopted this to say the application provide to shovel the condition assessment of the decorative historic front forward to post and provided the original material pricing posters names for 15 structural Integrity which will be repaired within kind of materials same condition to the potential recipe the original material and design of the decorative Square front porch poster on authorization that the post can be replaced at the time of building permit and the historic preservation officer shall authorize removal and replacement of the decorative Forge Post should the condition assessment illustrate that over 15 of the structural Integrity of the post has been compromised and the repair of the coast is not feasible criteria guidel ID historic which is related to Historic features being restored so the applicant is choosing to replace the signing both Dormers the front and the rear so that it reflects the original material on the exterior and then um guideline e so as I mentioned before this is this would apply to the report so those alterations as I mentioned were made the best as we can tell in 1938 which is after the period of significance for the historic district so that um in this particular case since that happens after the period of um it does not apply to the alterations um foreign so moving on to f and g so uh the applicant is requesting approval to replace the front porch and stairs again it includes the back porch and replace windows throughout the existing stairs and waving are not original to the QA house and they're proposed for at least concerns will be clearly new but of a compatible material and design the replacement porch decking and rail material it will also be clearly new but of a compatible material double hung Windows along secondary facades of the resource with double beam would double problem windows and these windows will be slightly smaller in size than the existing windows on these secondary facades or acquiring the applicant to reframe and decide the area around DC windows but they're located on the secondary facades so that will limit the visual impact of these changes the applicant's also proposing to replace the existing basement level single key and proper Windows throughout the resource with smaller vinyl windows and the majority of these windows are located on secondary facades minimizing their visual impact however the proposed new replacement window that they sent window on the front facade is highly visible currently and will have an accurate effective impact on the line on the resource so in order to better meet this guideline for this portion of the proposal staff recommends The Landmark solution adopt another condition of approval so condition three stating the replacement basement window on the primary facade of the Hewitt house shop that have been the existing boarding at 2021 inch opening for the original Windows location the attached and frame materials shall have the appearance of wood and be paintable and the opposed replacement of the material and specifications shall be provided to the historic preservation officer at the time um moving on to H and I so structural deficiencies so the the biggest challenge I think for this resource is adjusting the issues and he is imposing the porch which is at the the rear of the resource and it will result in school visual impacts and changes to the resource but again because it's after we are on a secondary facade it will minimize the impact and I there is no excavation of your proposed as part of this proposals so that guy I'm just not so in some staff recommends the landmarks commission and find that the proposal leads the applicable guidelines in SRC 230065 provided the recommended conditions are adopted so moving on to testimony we've received a number of of the comments and support so just today we received to be on your desk in email and support from Stephen Elmore an email from Jim Lloyd in support and then the Adkins submitted testimony and support from Jamie Fisher through Kaufman who are old on Charles soul and Joshua we've received no formal comments from the Men Northeast neighbors neighborhood the building and safety division indicated that building permits are required and that all of that and guard designs will require manufacturers installation instructions and the windows will require verification of the heat press and all this information will be required when documents are provided the playing division fire department and put the books and",

reach out if you have any questions sorry that was a long date thank you director benner that's great and i completely agree it will take time but knowing that it's a 10-year program it also provides that certainty to be able to kind of expand programs there are other updates that people commissioners want to make i'll just note that um suzanne carlson is here for representing and catherine williams is here representing northwest natural um and i don't know if uh mike is officially representing oregon department of agriculture but he's here um glad to have you join us and i'm trying to see who else might be in that same i think that might be it but um do uh catherine or suzanne do you have any updates you'd like to share kathy can you hear me this is catherine okay good sorry we've been working behind the scenes on some i needed to be in a different category to speak so i'm glad it's working um i just wanted to pull something out of what um director bunner said and that is she's right there's a lot of in terms of the investments that have to be worked out the good news is some of the work on things like hydrogen and production tax credits for that and rng we're hoping won't take as long because it's sort of a different way of boosting investments in those places so while there absolutely has to be rules written around some of those programs we're hoping um those will happen faster and sort of you know boost some projects even more quickly just by the evidence that congress is sort of supportive of those two ways to decarbonize the gas system so excited about all the aspects of the ira learning more every day thank you yeah thanks for switching me over um we're working at odot towards same goals and close partnership state agencies uh looking to start investing in electric vehicle structure your audio is really low so i don't know if you can it started off strong it's checking if i have my my right microphone set that's better it's much better didn't really do anything um saying that we're working in close collaboration with our state agency investing electric vehicle uh using some of the infrastructure investment in jobs act and then looking forward to a lot of the regulations that are coming forward this that we're counting on as well to really move the needle on greenhouse gas reductions around fuels vehicles as well as other other things we're doing around transit and transportation choices and any any number of things and that we've collaborated on the uh greenhouse gas plan that we talked about later in the meeting here great thank you danny anything to report for oregon department of forestry all right now thank you very much okay thank you all right uh linda will you remind uh folks that may be on line and interested in testifying how they can uh identify themselves as being interested in testifying um yes how you can do that is um if you look towards the bottom of your screen you're going to see a little smiley face and just to the it's in the reaction and if you look to your left on of that you're going to see a hand if you click on that it's a raised hand and that will indicate that you have a question and that will indicate to us that we that you that we can call on you um if you're out as a you would be you can hit a star three to raise your hand if you're on the phone or you can click on the i believe you have the hand or the raise hand button in addition to that um the group there too down near the bottom as we in the reaction buttons and you will show up as wanting to go ahead and have a question if not if you cannot get my our attention in those two ways you can go ahead and go into the chat and type a t and your name and then that will indicate to us that you have a question thank you i said it very quickly when you were going off mute but uh director bateman it's great to have you on board and uh exciting excited to think about how we can collaborate uh on things moving forward but just wanted to welcome you as uh this is your first meeting i believe it is thank you um i could say a few words about what we've been up to in recent months if if you'd like that'd be great yeah um so again i'm brenda bateman i joined the department of land conservation and development as the director may 1st the same day that the the state was reopening to the public and all of its front lobbies and front and since then our commission has met a couple of times and in their july passed the climate friendly and equitable communities rulemaking that they've been working on now for uh intently for the past year but obviously for longer than that um it's quite extensive we're very excited about it and we just filed the permanent uh full set of rules with the secretary of state yesterday um these are are pretty important i like to call them generational rules and um we view them as a bit of a legacy of our previous director jim roo who uh was very supportive of these rules and very active participant in their writing and their development um we know that climate change is real and so much of it comes from that really the crux of these rules are to give local jurisdictions the or we are asking them to to remove barriers to climate friendly areas so that future development is more walkable more uh structured closely together so that folks who are interested in other kinds of housing um uh multi-family housing middle housing duplexes triplex's quads can can build on lots that are currently zoned for single family and so that they can move around and access jobs recreation education and their daily business in absence of a car if they would like um and so there there are many different pieces of these rules um we actually are holding office hours and continuing to be in contact with local jurisdictions we will in each of our commission meetings bring forward what we're hearing where folks are having challenges where there are questions and we will continue to be active participants at the table during we also have a budget package that we'll take into the next legislative session specifically to support this implementation it's probably one of the largest requests we've ever brought forward we want to make sure that we're there at the table and helping with implementation um all along the way so happy to take questions and the details will continue to um solidify and emerge over the next several weeks and months thank you i think it'd be great to have have you and the department of transportation maybe do a joint presentation to this commission and also to the national and working lands advisory committee because i think there some great benefits in terms of natural working lands so opportunities there too in addition to all the great health benefits and greenhouse gas benefits of that of those we would like that ardot's been a strong partner on providing funding for assistance in this biennium as well as our request for the next biennium so it's it's a nice funding and support package we've put together thank you and also the oregon department of energy they were partners in that as well excellent uh well i think we have uh completed all the introductory and and we can go to our first agenda item alan are you pulling that presentation let me pull it up let me know when you can see it i can see it now i'm not sure it's in presentation mode but it should be there we go how's that that's perfect great thank you so as i mentioned today we're going to spend uh the bulk of our time talking about and giving an update on the modeling work that is going into the development of our roadmap to 2035. i will be kicking us off and then alan will be talking through some of the details of the modeling effort and we also have our consultants on from ssg to be able to add depth to some of the comments that we're making and answer any technical questions folks might have on this work and you'd go to the next slide please today we're going to basically kind of a quick reminder of where we've been uh and what we've been learning and then we're gonna kind of dive deep into the scenarios that we have developed go on top of our um reference case and baseline that we are excuse me reference case and projection for our programs and regulations that are in place and under development we will both review the the carbon benefit climate mitigation benefits of those scenarios but also some of the financial results today we'll get a sneak peek at the co-benefits metrics and and kind of give you examples of how we can look at these we'll be talking about that more at our next meeting then we'll finish off the presentation with next steps uh the presentation certainly want the commissioners to feel comfortable asking clarifying questions uh but we can we can hold more clarifying questions and discussion for after a break that we'll take for public comment um so uh hopefully we'll have plenty of time to really dig in on next slide that's a bit of a delay cathy so um just a quick refresh on where we've been at our last meeting as i mentioned we presented the reference case and but go ahead and click again we have it we pre we presented the reference case and a forecast looked at the programs that are in place for the programs and regulations that are in place or under development as i mentioned and at this meeting next slide uh we will be talking specifically about the scenario analysis and the mac curve and then as i mentioned getting a sneak peek on what our what we will be talking about in next slide i'm still two slides back allen so i don't know that one i'm still two slides back but hopefully i'll catch up catch back up lag annoying lag yeah fine other people can see the slides i can i can speak to them what what slide are we i think you're on on this slide you were we were talking about where we left off last time last time yeah i just i don't know that there's more to say have you progressed the slide there you go so at that last meeting we presented that we are currently on track with the programs regulations that are in place and with the programs and regulations that are under development uh to meet our 2035 goal in",

calculation from a provider that went with it and in I don't know 14 years of owning the building I've never once had a tenant take up the opportunity to engage in a solar project even though I had numbers that showed that if we put it on the building it would effectively knit zero every month so it's interesting that I did the work to provide the the system the capacity and all we had to do was put the inverters and the panels on the roof and nobody's taken up people would rather spend money on a major interior remodel for 150 000 then put a seventy thousand dollar solar system 100. it was very um kind of where the market's at where we're seeing on the in the real estate industry the demand or the push for it um there's just a couple of blocks south of here adjacent from my building there's a multi-tenant office building that is rented full service and they put solar on in that I think 2008-2009 vintage where they were getting roughly 40 to 50 percent of it back as grant money from working Department of energy and I think from the time that we saw solar panels go on roofs that was the most notable time frame so if programs like that came back at a state level we'd probably see more owners be willing to do it the idea of renting rooftops was something that we saw a lot of people starting to try to work numbers on in that 2006 seven eight time period um and their program of doing the net metering didn't allow the volume of income that was necessary for those that business model would work where somebody could go around two acres between different roofs on different properties and then the combination of power through those different properties and different ownerships again the utility companies wouldn't aggregate that together as if it was one individual selling directly to the utility so there's there's uh a variety of different things at play I don't know of anything that I've said is necessarily gives a concrete direction or comfort as to where the market might go from here but as far as some of the experience and when I saw solar going up on Commercial roofs it definitely had to do with when there was State money available to offset that I think that's from commenting through all of your comments that there needs to be grant funding there's going to be a realistic the fact that you're incurring interest on the capital when you install it that is the that is what makes it that pencil out um so you said in your example he said you had you would have to take on debt to put in the system so in the two projects that I've been involved in another profit in my house we also put on took on debt but you know to be in a federal tax break that covered that and the other was a grant that covered basically the cost of the debt so I was just interested in your experience that that seems to be an important issue yes absolutely and if you're looking at the cost of commercial debt today and it's um bushing seven percent um the if you look at what's your cap rate or your your return on your investment when you're looking at offset setting the electrical cost if let's take my office building with my eight tenants and average approximate thousand dollars a month if we took that and then calculated that forward we could put you know time value money on it and assess when does the system pay for itself it's so far out and then as interest rates continue to rise it pushes that Verizon even further out that for an investment for a building owner they need they have to realize a return on that investment in less than five years and so and and a building owner that's able to put money into a building and and wait for a return on that investment like let's say building out office for a large Warehouse user and so they give it a TI budget for that office and so they're going to go spend 100 000 and but they're getting 20 000 a month in rent well looking forward yeah they're getting 20 000 a month in rent but of that how much is allocated for that office space that's maybe only 10 of the warehouse and what did that landlord have to expand to do that well if that uh tenant has long enough term lease if they're nationally rated they're they're somewhat substantial then a landlord potentially could have that risk to extend those dollars knowing that they're not going to see the payback on that office portion for five years or longer if you're talking about little you know building owners in town like guys like me I need that return in two so if I if I go remodel an office for a tenant like we just have some bacon um what we had to spend on apparently a 400 square foot office was tens of thousands of dollars paint drywall ceilings new floors flying got really expensive um and so the the cost now looking at that it's like okay well the space rents um you know 800 a month when am I going to realize my expenses back so that's where it's uh for institutional investors if you had beats or I'm trying to think of um uh there's a DST which I'm not going to get into what that is but just think reads um but Phillips Edison that owns the property where uh Petco and Trader Joe's is located in South um The Entity that owns that is very very large they have lots of those types of class a retail Investments around Pacific Northwest somebody like that would have the capacity to do something there needs to be a lot of available grant money for somebody small like me to be able to step in to do something other conversations thanks commissioner Levin we'll move on to information reports we don't have any we said do you talk about the planning administrator I have no idea thank you I'm moving on to item nine Commissioners comments for the good of the order just I have two commissioner Slater and I thought it would be fun and meaningful to get us together outside of this chamber so we're going to clean up one of the beds on the peace Plaza you know right outside the mayor's office on Earth Day appropriate April 22nd at 11 and we'll get more details out to you I do know that I'll be ordering big wig Donuts as an enticement and also a reminder the state of the city is tomorrow where we're here from mayor hoyan what's happening in the city and his vision moving forward so other comments for the good authority commissioner English last Friday say from the City Club had a program with city manager and I thought I would point out that the city manager gave the planning Division and Lisa by name so I praise well there you go would you go on your vacation in through the conscience your job will be here when you get back other comments for the good of the order okay we'll move on to item 10 public comment we have Mr Courtright if you could come up and state your name and address for the record and you'll have five minutes once you kind of figure out that system up there I'm going to talk about your remember that we all receive this afternoon wonderful thank you chair Griggs Commissioners my name is West Salem I work with the 350 Salem org group but I'm here just representing myself today um hopefully I can get them involved in this as well so what I want to talk to you about is the climate friendly and Equitable communities rules that lcdc has adopted and City staff is working on one of the key parts of that is designating what are called climate friendly areas and the city in combination with Cog has just produced a study that estimates what the capacity of the areas that they think have potential for climate friendly interviews are wait just back up and focus on what the big picture here is for climate-friendly areas the Target that we're shooting for and the standard that we have to meet is to get 30 of the city's housing in these climate-friendly areas that totals according to the college estimates about 26 000 units a thousand that's over the next you know the total amount for through 2035 2040. um the concern I have is that the analysis that the staff has presented dramatically overestimates the capacity of the four areas that they've identified as potential climate-friendly consequence of that we stick with the analysis they've done so far is we're not going to designate enough area as climate-friendly areas to meet that 30 um and my what I'm asking you to do or for the city to do is to ask the staff to go back and review the study that you do review the study that's been done for our staff to come up with a more realistic assessment of what the capacity of these areas are and logically to go and look and identify other areas that have potential to decline-friendly areas um you have in my written memo come with some of the analysis here but I really want to emphasize how excessive and unrealistically estimates are that have been prepared so far and just to forgive the city a little bit they're following the recommendations that the LCD provided in their roles but those were untested and we all at least an advocacy expressed concern about this from the beginning but the estimates say um that basically these areas these four areas that include downtown Lancaster uh West Salem and I'm sorry I can't remember the fourth uh Liberty and Commercial I'm sorry um but those four areas could accommodate 55 000 units of housing that's all in excess of what's needed but currently our adopted plans estimate and this is out again through 2035 2040. that those areas will have about 3 000 units of housing that's 15 times as much housing as our current plans",

        "text": " I think that's that's the point I guess I'm trying to make um so let's go to the next slide and um this is a forward-looking slide I I will say that we are uh not starting as the pucr efforts uh this year I want to note that in Prior years we have uh accomplished such Preparatory activities as uh what we called the natural gas fact finding process where we tried to uh bring in a broader stakeholder Community to an understanding of um uh the Gas Utilities and the amount of sort of assets and infrastructure um that uh they're working with and and and and started to explore um big picture uh the suite of strategies for um decarbonization and and uh you know now in the context of the uh climate Protection Program although that wasn't uh finalized when we started that um we also have been preparing for implementation of HB 2021 um by uh running a process to help um stakeholders and and utilities focus on the parts of HB 2021 that were particularly new and different from the planning processes that have come before um so again some of the community benefits indicators um resiliency requirements um and and to some degree the emissions modeling as well but where we are now is in that blue shape um uh is in review of kind of the initial plans integrated resource plans clean energy plans and requests for proposals for resources that um have been filed following the adoption of the CPP and HB 2021 um we also have an open dockum um uh looking at some pretty significant legal and policy interpretation questions related to HB 2021 I can't talk about that but I but I'll note that um you know there are Divergent opinions about how the puc should um interpret some pretty material parts of that law and the other thing um that we're doing right now that I wanted to highlight is um really working on what I would characterize as external and enabling strategies so in the category of enabling strategies I would put things like um reform of the puc's interconnection rules which are the mechanism by which um you know mostly distributed energy resources connect to the utility system so trying to modernize and and reduce uh barriers for resources that are important to the emissions reductions and the small scale requirements on the external side um I guess I'd say that uh utility irps and is particularly true on the electric side are showing us that um uh issues like um well that our uh goals our requirements set forth in HB 2021 uh will be difficult uh to meet within those reliability and affordability parameters without um some changes um in the way the electric grid um the large Regional electric grid Works um things that neither the state nor the utilities have total control over and that includes things like um Regional transmission development to be able to access um a a diversity of of cost-effective resources that are um in different weather regimes throughout the region uh and also um markets that are able to help um the lowest cost resource um dis patch uh to bring down sort of the cost to Consumers who are facing frankly lots of costs um from this transition so all of those are really important pieces from our point of view that we're working on to um help uh these policies work um upcoming for the Pu uh we are working under integration resource planning rules that were adopted in 2007 kind of at the beginning of that uh policy timeline that I showed you before um and I I would expect in the 2024 to 2025 time frame for us to really need to be modernizing those and to um you know make them reflect new policies and and to make the procurement that happens around the planning processes um I don't know work better in today's environment the other thing that I wanted to note about what would be coming next year is is I'll talk later about you know the P will make its decision about whether the utilities are on the right track with the plans that are in front of us and that we're reviewing today but utility planning is you know apologies to utilities who are on here might say it differently but it it is basically a constant process so the second we um make a decision on one plan or maybe before we make a decision on one plan the utilities are gearing up um with their stakeholder uh Roundtable processes to develop the next plan um and and so you know we really are sort of constantly building the plane while while it's while it's flying and this is important that irps happen every every two years because conditions Chang really fast you know Renewable Energy prices have changed a lot over the last two years and um you know the the tradeoffs that utilities face change along with the industry and Market environment that they exist within and we have to keep looking at that uh in an iterative way um in the future you know we'll have that next cycle of review and and eventually we'll also get to um sort of figuring out our shared responsibility um you know with with between the DEQ and and pu for sort of compliance determinations and I'd say that just broadly across the two programs but uh let's move to the next slide where you can see a little bit more clearly where the engagement opportunities are so on the left side these are the Pu dockets that are currently going on so we're reviewing Portland General Pacific corpse IRP and and and uh clean energy plans right now uh we're also reviewing a Vista and Cascade natural gases um integrated resource plans and we just had Idaho Powers uh integrated resource plan filed again they're not subject to HB 2021 but uh they have you know voluntary clean energy goals are and are an important part of sort of the transmission conversation in our region so another interesting uh example of utility planning for the electricity future there um the other two boxes here are the blue and the orange are really meant to show the point that I was making before that this is kind of a constant process um the electric utilities have various kinds of engagements that are not specifically housed within the Pu for people to learn about um and influen um the plans as they're in development um and and the Gas Utilities uh also have sort of advisory committees as they're developing you know the plans in this in this kind of repeated iterative way uh okay let's go to this next slide wrapping up here people um uh this is just um kind of a more concrete we had some questions about in front of the legislature about exactly when the commission would be making decisions on the various uh plans that are in front of us and this just provides the dates that are currently scheduled we do try to keep things a little flexible as issues come up and they need more time for vetting uh but these are the dates that the Pu is currently scheduled to um make a decision in our public meetings um as you see with the Northwest Natural IRP uh decision that we already made uh our written order can end up following that public meeting decision by uh you know some some period of time um just because of the complexity of um not knowing what decision we're going to make and then having to to write it up um let's go to the last slide I um am not necessarily gonna go in I'm certainly not going to go through all of these and I'm not necessarily going to go into any of them um but um we really want to communicate that there are um some significant um tradeoffs and complexities and uncertainties that um you know are being discussed in these planning processes and you know some of which can be resolved there and and some of which uh frankly can't um in the you know for with respect to the regional issues um under pacing and flexibility it would put things like um uh sort of the questions of um do utilities uh procure more of the resources uh the clean resources that are commercially available today you know how is that tradeoff um balanced against uh sort of creating near-term rate pressures and potentially uh missing out on opportunities to um uh procure resources that haven't become commercialized yet in the future um you know it none of these things are are obvious um on the allocation of cost risks and benefits um we have lots of issues in front of us around uh energy burden and relative burden for paying for these policies between different rate classes and and and sort of um you know based on um EJ factors um lots of questions being raised about uh competition for um sort of what types of resources and and what business structures um the clean resources of the future should uh come to the utility under um we also have lots of questions being raised about the role of voluntary actions taken by those that want to go uh further and faster um are they really um making a a difference are they are they creating that additionality how do we count that um has that changed since we first started measuring additionality all of these are are valid and and sort of unavoidable questions um we'll get through all of them but um the the message is that um it will take some time and it will take the the support of the broader Community um to to get there I don't have much more to say I'm happy to answer questions I hope that um uh helped give people a sense of what we're up to thank you commissioner Decker I this is great and it's great to have all this information in such a clear and Consolidated fashion for folks to be able to reference and um because it is a it is a complex process as as you um certainly want to give um commissioner Sheron and Mary morland's an opportunity to weigh in if they want on any Reflections they have about this but but um one uh just maybe note for commissioner Decker and director Benner about two and a half years ago I think we had a did a deeper dive on um Regional markets and transmission as two of the really key um P things that that need to go well if if we're going to meet our goals and I just uh welcome um you to both uh propose agenda items for future meetings where um there might be some relevant updates and considerations um especially as we start thinking about uh developing our next um banial report but but anytime we can uh be a platform for kind of making sure those are those things are front of mind um and many of the other things you know probably it would be helpful for us to have a better understanding of energ burden and equity and rate classes as well and just how how to think about that um going forward so just um this",

        "text": " for a proportion of constructive and Improvement so that we're still getting the Improvement and the developments not just Stone out and so I think the idea is that potentially if those five other houses or you know businesses on that street pay their fee and low we could then potentially use that money to reverse the developer for actually going and constructing the project um I think we talk a lot about CIP project but a lot of those projects are projects that developers are building and that the city is so that actually brings us another question because in this case so if these funds are being spent on other projects the same that those five developers walk through the course machine and now we've spent there seeing the news on projects in other areas of town now that big developer comes in as an unanticipated apartment complex now they need to build a sewer line like you know I'm going with them sorry we would be able to look for a minute to get a pedia or amending through your monitors to potentially asking Council to approve reimbursement for them but it wouldn't it wouldn't in any scenario like stall development because this this thing that's been slowly funding or something reimbursement District through a separate process there we would be able to come up with these funds right but maybe so but so being a little general or General in your scenario is that if in order for new development to occur that needed um that's what the systems development charge the system processes all that you normally have to build an eight inch but in fact a 12 inch line I think it's numbers so the difference between building an eight inch Improvement spine is Costco certified and that project is eligible for refund on the system that's where their sewer system development in the system development charts the SDC program has five different components Parts water Wastewater storm water transportation so if it's a qualifying Improvement meaning skin the kind of improvement plan and it's in 309 list the 300 list is a separate the state required list of capital through this uh uh they don't but in order to receive that reimbursement we have to have enough money in the SDC fund and Council approves the budget it was snc enrichments so in your scenario it's not likely that it's a payment between versus um additional questions I have an additional question um if there's a project that and it's sort of just piggybacking on that but uh so if there's a project that's fully um through these families but those families have been put in this big larger pots and other areas so that so you can look back over the last 10 years and say okay this is now a fully funded project but that's somebody's no longer set aside as it will be today as a specific project is that going to automatically just but I guess will that project get done at that time or will it be added just in sort of Incorporated process if I understand your question scenario when you look at our Capital Improvement adopt for every project there's a set of columns on funding and it's got for example it's got sewer SDC uh some Grant fund or some matching fund for some of the source and it would have also Utility Fund sources whatever the number for the source this was added to the line it says the taco salad I think then and this would be sort of my final question I think is tracking means so like but SEC is pretty simple to track whether anesthesis is a pay if you have single family home you know and you're redeveloping a primary complex we just you can you just know that the SDC is based on a single family has to see in fact uh but with this it's totally different with every project every Capital Improvement project is different so how is that going to be tracked as to what spending and when and whether paintings were paid at the time of the initial developments uh I think maybe part of my question like if I'm doing a partition and um I'm charged a specific uh impact for that partition due to the fact that it doesn't have a sidewalking method for example um and then years down the road I decided to redevelop that parcel and that sidewalk still isn't built am I going to be charged again for that same so presently you have to um sign and be a move of agreement that gets recorded with property that basically says what we've collected it um and so in theory that would be in the title report and then you can find it you may be able to build some kind of tracking system into the administrative rule currently the only tracking system that we have now is the trust fund line items so there's a project number and address and then I was able to go into the individually without every single page to figure out what those improvements were or what those students would be improved for um but I think part of this program moving forward I'd like to map potentially once again collected and the potentially also have some kind of tracking system but like Robert mentioned I think ultimately we're not going to be so much dedicating money towards you know specific projects anymore and just lending the money into these lots of money for Street improvements will it continue to be listed on the title report though if like if I purchase a property where they've already paid if they removed for French improvements will I have that sort of record in the Deep or change title so I can say this is already been paid when I developed it yes the agreements currently get recorded against property thank you that's helpful other questions thank you Mr Heller thank you so much discussion I thought I encourage you to say that you can bring additional language the Amendments that we would take to city council we can look at the language does anybody want to test this job how about you no you're good you're right over there like this but okay okay we're glad you're here as soon as I know so I'm not going to go to the face like this I'm just not comfortable with getting a charging people to be for something that they eventually are not going to get I think it essentially becomes a tax um recently taxed to where you live and that tax states it's hard to turn money down a little bit money on the table but in this case I'm just simply not comfortable with this idea thank you I was a little uncomfortable initially right after that because I felt like if there's a project for but it wouldn't be used in their neighborhood like only hope is that those projects on the CIP are going to be a city council discussion and that we need to make sure that our counselors and our representing our words are a factor in the work that needs to be done within our Awards thank that's the only thing that immediates my concern about that because I have the same concern um about that but I'll be done other comments commissioner Google yeah I mean I think that cancer Slater's concerns were what I was initially with um held up on and I think that that staff's interview job and addressing um process and sort of proceeded before um I I don't think in terms of viewing it as a like tax for living or for having property adjacent to substanding development it's necessarily like in line with um the as long as it's properly tracked and that it's there is a record of where these funds have been hey I think that it ends up not negatively impacting those properties in the way that I initially thought that it um and I I think that I've actually sort of I think you could also do it as a development incentive in areas where those funds will now be used more readily to complete these projects right and so um in an area where a project would not have otherwise been completed until every property along that substandard Corridor contributes their feeding mood it can now sort of be prioritized or you know that that those fees can be used more readily and I I know it is a like a little and it's Unique and it's Innovative to do this in a way that's based on the city council's prioritization or other methodology for figuring out um how this distribution of these funds will take place but um I think we also kind of have to see it as a development incentive in some ways for um for those other areas when those important other comments please I too struggle with the application of dollars outside of the development area um I'm still uh questioning it whether or not it makes better sense some of what I've heard today definitely held I'm still questioning um I love to hear from everyone how they're leaning about their choice on both before we vote I think I'm gonna vote Yes because staff did reference that this has been done in other communities in different formats um I I am interested in seeing Salem take some steps to improve how where dollars are spent suspicions and things lower some of our STC fees um but I would um I would vote cautiously to support with the Declaration of staff that this will be watched closely and if this is unsuccessful that you there is going to be the support from public to change back to what it was and that staff should be prepared to do that this is an ultimate failure which I think would be fairly quickly experience dollars is that successful or so those are my thoughts thank you commissioner other thoughts around the table make sure you don't describe some of the initial concerns that because I think the current system may actually indirectly the kinds of Capital Improvements they want to do because it's restricted to particularly and I think that Michael This Is My Hope reason I would be voting for it is that I hope that the flexibility that his kids meetings that people have um that we can we can actually proceed faster to Capital Improvements and then our Capital Improvements will end up being the part of a it's a complete process where we could proceed rather than continue to wait for peaceful that's that's the that's what sways me is that I think it gives us more flexibility to actually improve the capital of the process rather than having small bits here and there and waiting for those small bits to tow up enough to actually get something honesty it's not participate I mean I'm kind of everyone else but I'm cautiously leaning towards it I mean my enactment of this I think would be similar to what it was just another thing a lot of you guys would have to be in the same neighborhood just because I do have some of the same concerns that you know money could take from one place and then just bump over a few minutes of um someone else to a different part of town and the people that are paying that never actually get anything out of the",

water we're willing to put in stream uh for listed species and fish uh and then you know we make that deal and so we build the first we built basically the penn stock first and that was six phases and that was a 10 million dollar project and uh we actually originally identified about eight and a half cfs and we were going to put back six but ultimately we ended up putting back eight uh and then that gets certificated by the oregon war resource department and those certificates are create a in-stream water right that is now protected in perpetuity land watch came at us and said no we think you should do more ultimately the county commissioners agreed with us and the land use board of appeals agreed with us but it cost us a two-year delay and two hundred thousand dollars in legal fees which we were not able to so uh that was that was a whole new adventure for us um but you know we prevailed and we're in the process of um putting in uh the project and as a matter of fact we've kind of doing a pre-ribbon cutting tomorrow with senator merkley and then the under secretary of agriculture at bonnie and so you know this for us it's been very successful because we use the uh revenues from the generation to pay down debt on the clean water evolving loans that we get from deq because obviously our projects are 100 selling all our power to pacific core and then pacific or in turn using uh that uh those that green energy to meet their rps commitment to oregon uh their renewable portfolio standard anyway um you know we're real happy uh we've installed 50 million dollars of infrastructure over the last 25 years uh when we're all done we're going to be carrying less than 4 million dollars of that'll all get paid off and you know we'll be generating uh four to five million kilowatt hours uh annually of green renewable energy that'll all go to pack for the first 20 years in addition to that because of the pressurized system we have conserved uh and eliminated nine million kilowatt hours of pumping uh and at this point three sisters irrigation district is completely carbon neutral uh based on our generation uh based on the conservation and based on the crops that were growing uh we could if there was a vehicle we could probably sell uh carbon credits so um you know i'm happy to answer any questions and dive into more detail uh unwheeling tariffs and some of the other things if anyone wants to ask great thanks mark really appreciate it and way to stick to that ten minutes perfectly so do we have any hands raised from work group members with any particular questions uh looks like john jennings we'll start with you then we'll go to mike and then shadow hey thank you and and thank you mark for your you know your description here uh really really good stuff and interesting stuff i guess i have two things um one i guess i just want to kind of understand to make sure i understand the the description um you know kind of the the order of administration so to speak here so so for this project you have a power purchase agreement with the specific core but you have to use cec infrastructure so they charge you a wheeling fee but then cec consumes or would consume all the power um that you generate did i get that right i mean basically the power never makes it to redmond i mean and it's not a lot of power i mean the three projects combined are going to be a total of 1.2 megawatts and um you know when we're running at low flow that'll that'll drop in half but um it's just it's one of those things that you know there there should be some sort of allowances in the state where they take a look at you know smaller projects you know i refer to this as virtual wheeling um you know there's just they're using the power and um you know basically bpa is in turn you know giving power to uh pacificorp that we're getting credit for so you know it's just it's just a balancing act uh but it's there's not the actual physical act of the power being transmitted 20 miles away to the redmond substation yeah that's always kind of been an intriguing aspect of energy for me second thing and i i know there's some other hands up but i i want them to have a chance um but um you mentioned um central oregon land watch and which is a you know which is which is a local heritage county atlantic advocacy group i i'm assuming that that was the day you guys have to go through a conditional use proceeding before deschutes county and then they they appealed they appealed that to the board of commissioners and then the luba is that is that how that worked uh yes so so basically we went through uh land conditional use permit it went in front of a hearings officer the hearings officer agreed with us about 98 he had two technical things a number of land use lawyers that we didn't hire pointed out to the county that uh the hearings officer was an error we appealed it to the commissioners land watch appealed at the commissioners because all the points that land watch had brought up the uh hearings officer disagreed with them on uh so they basically they upheld our appeal they denied land watchers appeal they appealed to luba we won there as well and it was unanimous on all points and then they could have filed at the oregon court of appeals but i made it clear to their lawyers that we would be requesting legal fees uh on the third go around because you're not able to get legal fees on the first two so as a result they chose they chose not to push it pretty good so and again their their motivation there was they were they were asking for a larger in-stream contribution yeah correct and and the problem the problem is is that um you know that's why we do engineered studies so we know how much conserved water there is and if we turn around and start giving away more water than was conserved then our patrons could sue us that would be considered a takings under the constitution and it just you know when when we applied for our clean water evolving loan grants for our loans and for all our grants from uh whether it be o web and um pelton and uh water smart and a number of other you know all this was all laid out eight nine years ago so everybody knew where we were and um the board generously agreed to put more water in as time went for a little bit more compensation and um it just it wasn't it wasn't very nice of them uh to do that but as it turned out um nobody agreed with them and uh you know i i litigation is not new to me i i've been through uh 12 lawsuits and then this is you know a legal action but uh you know i've now got 12 wins and one tie so i'm used to this stuff great thank you so much john with those questions and with those answers we have a few minutes left and like a lot of hands up so um let's see if folks can be all as concise as possible so we can get through the questions mike you're up next thank you mark mike macarthur with community renewable energy association uh thanks for your presentation it's a wonderful example of what can be done if policies get lined up right i'm quite my question is are you a qualifying facility under purpa or do you have a regular ppa yeah so so so we're cute we're cute all three all three facilities are qfs uh the only difference is is that uh the first one the 700 kw was a small conduit exemption through ferc um and then i actually personally uh worked on uh the legislation uh that president obama that basically created a qualified um and both my 200 kw and my 300 kw plants are qs under that where once we meet the criteria ferc actually exempts us from the power act so we are completely exempted from the power act and we are still a qf but we are there's there i don't have to deal with uh work on all that so you're operating you're getting paid on under avoided cost rates uh schedule yeah so pay under the avoided cost rates which um you know go down every year so is that becoming more of a problem for you going forward it it it's not a problem for us because we structure the deal with uh energy trust um obviously oregon department of energy has been a fabulous partner with the renewable grants and then bureau of reclamation has participated in two of the three hydro plants and then bonneville environmental foundation uh participated in the micro hydro demonstration project so i i've been able to structure uh the debt um so that that it's the main goal when all was said and done was to create green energy put water in stream for steelhead and bull trout and salmon and create more water for the farmers and we've accomplished all that at a minimal cost i mean you know a normal debt load for 50 million dollars of infrastructure would be more like 25 million dollars great okay thank you so much um and then can we move on to acacia please hey there um thanks mark questions for you also around the wheeling so um can you just explain why you um let's see why you're wheeling to pacific core is it was cec un willing to sign a contract for the power or did did you get a better rate through pacific core um no it's it's not that it's the the co-op doesn't have any ability to incentivize the project um the way the investor-owned utilities do through uh energy trust of oregon so without energy trust of oregon uh these projects would never happen okay thanks and then you also were throwing out the numbers on the revenues and then the cost of the wheeling charges what what percentage of your revenues were consumed by it's roughly uh you know 33 to 40 percent in a drought year it's over 50 okay thank you fascinating okay thank you so much and then looks like d",
