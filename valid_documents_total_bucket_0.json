        "text": " just want to put on America I think that's important to know um that's a good it's a good comment this this comment and I don't uh do I have that condition all the way in front of me I believe that this one was specific to the construction contractor yeah so this is just related to construction whereas I think your comment which I think will be captured more in in this part of the discussion is talking about the the applicant right so if you're if applicant or a parent company changes how do we track that there's still like a reliable good you know good active so I think that this part of the conversation is going to cover that more but that part was just a construction contractor yeah because we want to make sure that you know choosing good construction um which I'm sure they would but not necessarily the lowest bidder but that is up to them so we have that part of that condition so um in uh November uh council member Condon expressed some concerns about the Project Specific LLC the Articles of um and in its responses the applicant you know provided more information back some of it is what is already included in the application and then they had these representations and then in the staff report the department provides I guess it's like we we do we provide Redline of conditions but I'm just kind of going to talk through this is more we're not like that we're not bound to that but I want to talk through the concept here or the the idea um because the applicant doesn't provide copies of insurance uh or that the Project Specific LLC has assets um because it's difficult if we think about a new application for site they don't really have that and again even though this is not in the application this isn't but in the conversation if we were looking at say an operational asset energy facility that that's functioning under its Project Specific LLC that company has the assets because the asset one is the energy facility on the landscape and it's getting Revenue because it has this it's PPA or whatnot and it gets its bills say for instance the bill from the the the county it's tax you know bill which is several million dollars you know and so it's paying its bills out of that in that case it's almost like the organizational expertise standard is easier because they're like look see right we we are demonstrating that we operating our facility in compliance with the site certificate conditions in a manner that protects public health and safety in the environment but the new application it's a little bit difficult so I think that that is well one applicants are providing what are division 21 rules say to provide um and really they don't have that Project Specific LLC doesn't have the you know ability they have to rely on their parent company because it doesn't really have anything to prove yet or to show anyway so that's that so in the staff report the discussion and kind of where staff has gone with this um because I know in the draft proposed order we had attached to this parent company guarantee that I think um has has some issues with how it was worded in between the you know the applicant and Council and it has there's been some issues with this and really the conversation has gone to where really in these because in these operational circumstances where maybe the operation there's issues with the operation or an applicant a Project Specific LLC is not able to maintain the facility or something's happening where the facility is not able to function in a manner consistent with site certificate conditions and in a way that protects public health and safety then in in operation in if the facility was retired we have retirement over here right like we can do we that's that's kind of straightforward um but what do you do in this operational circumstances and I feel like where we have gone is that we think that there is an answer in the existing site specific site certificate conditions and rules that surround and Empower Council to have uh you know compliance Authority um so in the staff report you know it says under ORS 469 430 the council has continued authority over the site for which the certificate is issued and may inspect or direct the department to inspect or request another state agency or local government to inspect the site at any time to ensure that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms of the site certificate and then further down in uh Council standards and in the conditions we have manned Council has mandatory conditions that basically um give opportunities and Todd and Sarah would be able to speak more to this for to issue notice of violations of the site certificate condition so it's in general and so in the staff report I'm listing out you know we list out all these conditions some of them are recommended conditions that we're recommending that have some sort of monitoring or maintenance component right because that's what we're talking about during operation some issue happening and the and the certificate holder not taking care of the facility so really if we have if we make sure that all of our conditions cover those instances and that there's a way for the Department to become aware of them then there's all of these other avenues for the department and the council to be able to intervene um that said do I have it up here that said well I don't know if I have another slide for this so that said what the department recommends to kind of go uh and I'm sorry I'm looking at Council number time be real direct here um so really where the department is what the department is recommending and we don't need to like dial in on specific language but but the the concept here is that we we have the organizational expertise condition three which it this is a bigger buildup condition which there's some other organizational expertise conditions right so condition one any manner of non-compliance underneath the site certificates responsibility site certificate holder any notice of violation issued another site certificate will be issued to the certificate holder this condition and then we have condition two which is this notification of occurrences and so these are just like a person is kind of like these generalized occurrences but then organizational expertise condition three it's it's reporting instances or circumstances that may violate terms of the condition terms uh or conditions of the site certificate of any other Council order or any other order um it's to initiate uh and complete appropriate action uh it's also to submit a written report so we want a report submitted within 30 days of that incident and so what we the department has recommended recommended is that part of that is that we want since this is reporting component functionally is like one in right instance or or circumstance let's say they 've spilled some Transformer oil and are reporting it so that would appear in this report it would also appear in our annual report too so there's some duplicative nature of this but this gives us a more immediate notice that something has happened but really as the condition was written it's only it's kind of like a one-off incidence right like was build Transformer oil and then we cleaned it up and then you know the report whatever so what we've done is we've added an aspect of this of you need to tell us of these repeat things we want to know because we want to know are there these repeat things happening so in our compliance program depending on who gets it they can kind of see and you know raise it to cancel like it all right so oh we've actually in the last six months we've got we've had five Transformer oil um this is an issue right and that may like raise it and we need to you know increase our compliance our site visits whatever the the outcome is how to do whatever do it to corrective action but what we've done or recommending is tying this condition and that part of it to account for to give the department and the council the ability that if we're seeing these um not only violations but instances or a circumstance that raise these concerns it gives the council the ability to kind of open up the retirement condition and adjust the contingencies of the future development contingency to be able to maybe to to adjust that rate requirement total and retirement bond in the idea and in the overall protection um if the facility if the the you know the Project Specific LLC is not operating it and that facility goes defunct or if canceled through its other rules can basically withdraw the site functionally retire the facility then you have that bond with an increased contingency amount to adjust so it's what they're on the Thrive period it says recommended condition for I it's three yeah this is uh erroneous because we got we deleted like in the proposed order um we got rid of that parent company guarantee condition which renumbered them so this would be describing this if you want to actually see the language of the proposed condition itself you could look for staff report page eight positions and all also um pull it up where are you there so now this has I have it kind of pulled up here so you have a version in your staff report um I have so we have and again we can we can dial in on specific language or we can talk about the concept and as secretary Cornett um does so well is he captures the idea and then we reflect it and then Council looks at it later so what I have here so now this is a little bit I don't I mean we're in a version control issue here so I maybe since Patrick just pointed you there I'll pull the stat the language and the staff um yeah so actually the Linked In the staff report will be a little bit different than what you just showed on the screen yeah and which is a little bit different from them what you also emailed so we're like let's not let's just look at um I'm just gonna suggest we look at just the stack report and we can kind of go and just have a conversation from their first simplicity's sake that I and oops works make that bigger so this is what's in the stack of December 9 is that correct what we're actually going to be proposing of slightly conversion to the back language well depending on what council wants to do yeah yeah but consistent with how I how I capture that um Patrick's recommended language that that isn't that kind of opens it up to not just violations but also you know instances or circumstances but maybe it kind of opens it up a little bit more broadly it's about language this is handling language you're proposing is um in some work six identify instance of repeat or multiple violations and let me pull up what Patrick sent you know we haven't so this is eliminate the navigation bar that would be yeah It's Gonna Go the language on top is what is",

        "text": " corresponds with that information on there or not okay I mean if if you wanted to we could certainly identify that for you I was just curious really yeah thanks um okay next on my list is uh an overview I sent last week um the department of energy provided a presentation to the house interim committee on climate energy and environment that was on Wednesday so it consisted of several parts so the first part was uh director Janine Benner and Ruchi Sadir who's the associate director for Street strategic engagement so they did a more overview of um you know energy in Oregon uh what the needs are um going over the strategic planning effort that they agency is engaged in right now uh which we should have a presentation on that to council at the next council meeting um and um they got quite a few questions then Sarah esterson did a overview basically an FC 101 so she did a great job I'd encourage you guys to look uh watch the the recording then Sarah did a presentation with Jerry Jeremy Thompson who our ladies on Department offici w life uh along with John Jennings fromel and Alexis Hammer also with the Department of land conservation and development really the the um committee wanted to better understand you know just beyond sort of the high level FC 101 the role of reviewing agencies in the council's review so Sarah provided that um more detailed overview and then Jeremy got into you know kind of what their role is identifying that you know in one example the bakeoven project that the applicant actually started working with them eight years before they even submitted to us so that there's a lot of coordination that goes on even before people come to the Department of energy and initiate U conversations let alone submitting a notice notice of intent us uh and my component was looking at the state and federal reviews when there's a dual review uh and how does that work and how can we avoid duplication and and minimizing efforts and so I had about a 15-minute presentation unfortunately there were so many questions um that my component got bumped so that will likely come up at another meeting in the future um and then last on my list is the uh future meetings so we have June uh 14th so two weeks from today so the three items we have on that agenda item right now is the council's review of the draft proposed order for Boardman to Hemingway Amendment two and then the um uh Wagon Trail solar project so we had those draft proposed order hearings last night um and then as I had indicated uh a staff member Edith fa from the Department of energy will be providing an overview on the uh strategic uh energy plan that she's working on uh among other people at the agency so it's kind of I would say the about a third of the way into that process so it's probably a good timing to get an overview of what that is um so that'll be a one day meeting probably half day in then got the wrong one up here but then the July meeting second uh 18th and 19th and right now uh depending upon how it goes we're we're looking at being in klaten so that would be another draft proposed order hearing um on an amendment for the missed natural gas underground storage facility uh among other things but that would be the location driver if if we're ready chair how um yes councelor car um Todd I'm sorry to go M delayed mine but when the video the recording of Sarah's presentation comes out will you send us a link sure it should be up there now but um okay but that's okay I'll um once we get into the the next agenda item I'll I'll I'll look for that it should be there and if it is then I'll send that link out to you okay thank you uh and that is the last item on my report unless council members have any questions any other questions okay thank you secretary cornette the next item is the wheat rdge energy facility East request for Amendment one uh the council will be reviewing the proposed order uh decision of any submitted request for contested case which we do have and U possible material change hearing and public notice of hearing to adopt final order chrisopher Clark senior sighting analyst will uh present over review of the approved but not yet constructed um facility thank you chair how uh council members can you hear me okay excellent um for the record my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Department um as chair how mentioned I will be um reviewing the request for Amendment one of the site certificate for wheat rdge renewable facility East today um as well as the request for contested case received on that proceeding um and the contents of the proposed order if I could get the next slide as part of my presentation I'll be um providing a facility overview and an overview of the site certificate history um going over the proposed changes in the procedural history that uh led to this point um a brief overview of the comments received on the draft proposed order um a brief overview of the contents of the proposed orders and staff's recommendations uh to approve as the final order um and then a uh more detailed uh review and staff's recommendations regarding the contested case request um if I could get the next please great um so uh we spoke at this about this facility in detail last month um so you are likely familiar with it but um just as a refresher uh Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility East is a approved but not constructed 200 megawatt Wind Farm uh that is uh cited in Morrow and Umatilla County um the facility as approved would consist of up to 66 wind turbines uh and a 31 mile um interconnection line cited within a 45 82 Acres uh site uh like I said in matilla County um if you can see on this slide here the turbines are currently proposed to be cited in the micro sighting area um kind of on the Eastern side of the facility and then the uh interconnection line would connect the energy facility site um to the Blue Ridge substation uh which is connected with the other bdge facilities next slide please um there's a lot of moving Parts in request for Amendment one um the biggest change is that the uh certificate holder is uh proposing to expand both the um micro sighting quarters and the site boundary the micro site in quarters would increase from that um 4,582 acre amount to about um that in large site would accommodate uh up to 41 additional turbines um as I'll go over in a second um the site boundary would also increase in size from what is currently the micros sighting corridors to the lease boundary of the properties um that the facility would be sighted on so that would result in an increase of about 74,400 Acres um which really does bring the like I said the site boundary out to the edge of the property rather than just the edge of the micro sighting areas in total all the changes in request for Amendment one would result in an additional 118 Acres of permanent disturbance and 635 Acres of temporary disturbance and I get the next slide you can see this visually um so just to to clarify the blue area on this map are the approved uh micro sighting corridors for both the energy facility and the transmission line um as shown on the map the new micro sighting areas are shown in light purple um those areas would contain um The increased turbine amount distributed through the site so I think there' be some redistribution of previously approved turbine sites as well as the news herbines um kind of spread out through that site and then the site bound would uh expand to that out dark purple outline um where there's no color on the map those are areas that are inside the purple boundary are part of the site but they're not proposed for development at time um as you can see on the very western edge of the site there is still some area of the proposed transmission line Corridor that are not associated with the energy facility site itself um those largely overlap with the previously approved transmission line Corridor um but there are some new routes to avoid I think buildt infrastructure on um in that area I could get the next slide please and please do stop me if you have any um uh great yeah so back to numbers as I mentioned this would be an increase um of approximately 41 or up to 41 turbines for a total of 107 turbines distributed through that site um which would be a a increase of 100 megaw of uh total name plate generating capacity um the reconfigured facility would eliminate overhead 34.5 KV collector lines um but kind of greatly expand the underground collector align system um it would also reconfigure the 230 KV transmission line route as I mentioned um with the rerouting result resulting in a a slight decrease in overall length of the route um to accommodate all this new infrastructure the certificate holder would also be expanding their Access Road network uh for a net increase of 56 new miles of additional permanent access roads um and a net decrease of 16 miles of temporary access roads um so so the the and the temporary access roads that would be built are mostly associated with the transmission line Corridor um in addition to the kind of physical changes to the facility uh request for Amendment one also requests to extend the construction completion deadline um by three years from 2023 to 2026 uh as I'll mention uh later there there was some changes on that in the proposed order so we do have a a new proposed construction commencement and constru completion deadline um but I can go over that when we get to that section next slide please um great just to give a quick overview of the procedural history for this uh this proceeding uh we got the preliminary request for Amendment one uh in I guess May of last year and uh did our completeness review um got all the additional information that was requested uh on January 30th of this year um the council we issued the prop draft proposed order on February 29th and then held the public hearing on 21st um with a comment period that extended through April 4th um the council reviewed the draft proposed order in the public comments at its meeting last month um and we issued the proposed order shortly after on the 25th of April um the deadline for contested case requests was May 27th and as we mentioned we did receive one timely contested case request um that puts the final decision before",

        "text": " be able to answer both clarifying questions and any questions that you have during deliberations thank you um do Commissioners have questions for Mr uh M Mr burwitz um the staff is recommending we take a public testimony tonight and continue the hearing until the next meeting on November 18th I think you said um November 15th correct yes uh was that because uh of this um these signatures you mentioned as as opposed to like had they not been collected we could move forward without a continuance that's when we were uh informed by our Council that uh is kind of a a safe time where we we will know um whether the signature Gathering was successful or not okay that that process affects our decision to uh in our opinion yes than U Mr B was just a couple quick questions um could the city choose not grow you said that they're required to do an analysis but City leadership and the community at large could they essentially say yeah that's cool but um we'd rather not uh they could do so but they would be um uh in conf with uh with go 14 and other based upon the analysises they completed that is correct that to some people would suggest that were self-serving anyway uh couple other things um I thought uh the air strip wasn't included but the golf course wasn't considered either North Plains might want to comment on that I might note that uh the city of North planes will um come up first and have an organized presentation so that might be good thank you if I could just add if the what what golf course are you referring to Pumpkin Verge is outside of the urban growth is uh is within the um uh rural reserve for my understanding and so it can't be mman has to be on there you go got it sorry first live meeting did you at the beginning say that state law requires the county to pass this ordinance requires it to consider consider okay but doesn't require them to pass it in order for state law in order for um the department of land conservation and development to review this ordinance or I'm sorry to review North PL ggb expansion the expansion um The Identical boundary has to be approved through ordinance by both the uh the city and uh and the county so that is a requirement for the for dlcd to even consider it okay so are there consequences if planning Commissioners vote against the proposal was just I want go next I would say first of all the Planning Commission is makes a recommendation to the board should the board decide um to uh to not move forward on the ordinance then egb expansion cannot be considered by dlcd okay um and I heard you say the time to appeal the growth study has pass so that just is what it is so that that's specifically um um related to the economic opportunities analysis so that was um that was approved uh uh late last year by um by uh the north PL city council and then it was acknowledged in late December by the dlcd um so generally um and then the time has passed to appeal that and that's um that's considered law that's considered approved in um the whether the um whether people might question the analyses that actually went into that or the state criteria um it's it's an acknowledged document that I think I got two more you said there's a signature Gathering initiative that would put something on the ballot to vote on this is that that's our understanding I can't really speak to the details of that but and are there any other ways inside of the process that folks could stop this from happening or that this would be prevented from happening from inside of the um I mean it would I'm happy to jump in on these go for it that would be helpful so um let's back up one question if I can commissioner so it's our understanding the city of of North Plains has received a referenda petition so referenda is in the Oregon Constitution has been there since 1906 as I recall and it allows citizens to file a petition to stop a law from going into effect and refer it for a public vote and so our understanding is that such a petition has been filed if the city recorder verifies it has adequate signatures then that will essentially Force the ordinance onto the ballot in May of next year you see this pretty often in state laws as well it's the same process um that people can file a referenda and essentially refer a law they they would prefer be voted on by the people rather than by the legislature in this case the city council so that's the general response to your first question it's our understanding that you know in the time between now because this just got filed I think yesterday between now and November 15th when we were planning on having uh this hearing continue to anyways because quite frankly we don't think you can get through it all tonight um we can figure out whether or not that petition is in fact verified and whether there will be that vote so that's just another piece of information that we hope to be able to provide to you on no November 15th I don't want to get into what the legalities of that uh would look like for the board because we're not quite there yet um and then I already forgot your next question which was the next one in line you were asking Todd something else that sounded very legal too oh yeah I thought up one more also okay but the question that we forgot is is there are there opportunities inside of the process to to prevent this from happening or is this well here's one is is here um obviously in front of the city council in front of the Planning Commission then in front of the Board of Commissioners and then as U Mr burkowitz mentioned even if all of that passes which is if if if it still has to go to the land conservation and development commission be reviewed by the department of land conservation and development and they would have to acknowledge it and accept it assuming they do so that's if if if and then people could actually appeal that to the land use Board of appeal and then the court of appeals so there is lots of procedural opportunities here okay I have a I have a last question go ahead sorry uh when and how did like North Plains Gaston and Banks get designated Urban anything I'm going to turn that back to to Mr baritz because that's well beyond my knowledge are you are you specifically asking about the the reserves process uh I think I'm asking when there was an urban growth B established for these places and why they're included in needing to plan this way no I'm not actually sure when the actual urban growth boundary was established but I think Teresa might have some insight so those three cities have been cities for quite a while I don't know how long but um North Plains can probably um so they can tell you when they became a city um so um and uh state law does uh provide for cities to have Urban growth boundaries so they do need to establish those um there is process set up for how they do that and then process for how they change it um but I believe if you are a city you need to have a urban growth boundary okay so it's because they're they're cities they've designated cities okay that's all my questions thanks everyone commissioner Kaiser Mr boritz uh in the event this ordinance was rejected or remanded back to the City would they be under an obligation to continue the process with uh their Urban growth boundary at some point they have to continue that process and submit and get to a spot where uh dlcd would accept that correct I mean you can't just never expand your Urban growth boundary ever again right you have to continue to do something you have to put something together uh factually uh and submit it as a city correct uh I would defer to the city what they would do um should the County reject uh this ordinance and then from the perspective of the the referenda uh my question is wouldn't absolutely no U opposition to the fact that we're going to hold we've got all this hearing and we've got plenty of time but generally speaking if that did get verified you would still run this process concurrently no matter what right um commissioner probably in front of the Planning Commission potentially depending on timing in front of the board County Commissioners I would have other legal reservations it about potentially enacting an ordinance on top of another ordinance that is not effective because it's been referred to the voters understand thank Commissioners commissioner Mo beu thank you chair Lockwood um under Oregon Statewide planning goal one citizen involvement um I just want to get a better understanding of what the process was for the county I think that there was a lot of written testimony that we read that was asking about um the process or um criticizing the process so I was just hoping to understand more about what was done to reach out to the people of North Plains the surrounding neighbors and um what was to uh get General voice of the people that actually live there uh so first of all um I just want to clarify that staff is still reading through the the testimony we've received a lot of testimony and um I can't necessarily speak to to all of it at this time um regarding uh what the county U what the county did on the County's ordinance for notification I would um defer to page five of your staff report um I'm kind of happy to kind of skim through that here for you but um at the bottom it says ordinance notification uh was mailed um so notification for this ordinance again this is just specific for the County ordinance not the not the cities um we'll set to parties on the general and individual not notification list um Service District and interested parties um including owners who received notice um the city North Plains on their ordinance so we uh uh we sent it out to people that provided testimony um on the on the city's um and then uh yeah and then it went through otherwise it went through the the typical not notification process that we will go through for an ordinance but we did uh we did make attempts to um to really go beyond um the standard process and include people that have um provided testimony to North Plains even though we weren't required to do so and I me add to that so the county relied on the city's process primarily for the the community outreach and the um the goal one kind of Citizen involvement um and so maybe they can speak to that when they when they um when they talk to that and the County's role really with our ordinance um and we participated on the city's process and then we've we've done",

        "text": " would uh perform uh Outreach uh to the affected communities and the neighborhood associations and then a public hearing would either come before counc or the Planning Commission there's SE several procedural requirements that need to be made throughout this process so you probably wouldn't see an actual ordinance in front of you for um I'm going to say at least 6 months probably longer oh she's given me the 10 signals so so so it may be close to a year before you actually see an actual Amendment on this thank you I have a couple of questions uh one I just you mentioned that uh well first of all I guess I want to just clarify if we approve this tonight that just starts a process it doesn't say that we're eventually going to adopt these it just gives us the opportunity to adopt them in the future is that true that's correct So eventually either uh ordinance for first reading will come before you or you'll consider it at a public hearing first and then you would consider an ordinance thank you and you you mentioned kind of an optional track there which it would either come to Planning Commission for a hearing or it would come to us how will that be determined for I guess I'll stop there first how will that be determined if Council has uh DRS on that uh they can let us know at this proceeding and we can um follow that guidance accordingly thank you councelor Stapleton is giving me the signal like I'm asking questions before we have a motion am I still good or do we need a first um you you can ask questions first I'm still kind of in my my comment great so um one other I guess I just will make a statement in that since we're talking about our Authority and our call up and that sort of thing I think it's important that city council hold that hearing and not defer that to somebody else to some other group so as much as I would I would be very interested in hearing planning commission's opinion I think that it's it's our decision and so therefore we should have the the hearing so that's just my take on it okay I'll stop talking now so other people can uh ask questions or make comments or make a motion I was just going to say completely agree with you thank you counselor any other questions or comments or emotions just to throw it all out there I move that we direct staff to initiate an amendment to the UDC to restrict Council callup of certain types of land use decisions as outlined in the report second motion by Stapleton second by Phillips further discussion uh yeah I'll just say uh I also agree with you 100% I think this is a council thing um um but I also would love to hear from the Planning Commission um I'm I'm really glad that uh this is going to take 10 months I know that that sounds weird but I think giving the community time and staff time to really look into this look into the new bills that have passed and see how it impacts us um and then get feedback uh from our community is going to be really important before we move forward thank you councelor yeah I think that engagement with the neighborhood associations is going to be critical to make either whether this goes or not so councelor gwy I just wanted to point out that we do have two letters of opposition from two neighborhood associations to this um just for the record yep thank you scan and Ela I think if I recall correctly yeah uh councelor Phillips um there's at least one other in the works uh I was president at Morningside when they told me to my face that they oppose this um I mean I I only wish that I had made the motion that's how strongly I feel about this um you know that phrase quasi judicial is not something that despite being what I consider a pretty smart person I've been able to effectively explain to anybody and when you can't explain a process to your constituents and tell them how no no in this situation I'm not your elected lobbyist I'm a juror and you know our my eyes crossed their eyes crossed we don't really know what's happening I I want to get out of this business so I I think think that the only place where I might not be in lock step with my colleagues is I would prefer most of this go to the Planning Commission um uh but I I didn't know if that was like for everything or just some things so my question beyond my comments is just that like is it the how much of this are we looking to take back in-house versus get over to the Commission um it's really to be determined as far as the uh like I said before there's if decisions are appealed we would have to allow for a local appeal and the Planning Commission would be the likely recipient of of most of appeals I would let Lisa uh come up to explain that further or disagree with me um I mean I think I'm fine with that I'm satisfied so uh you know at the risk of a few more comments um you know land use is important and someone needs to be that that that um I just think that with all the you know we we talked about how we're trying to look at getting out of a situation where there's the illusion of some amount of determination or discretion and you know at this point the amount of determination discretion we have is like paper you know wide the width of a paper like it there's just not we've been prescribed on what we can and can't do and if we can't push back when you're developing housing on top of like a gas station I I don't want to like spend and give the community the sense that they have the ability to push back on that through this process I don't want to create the false hope that that testimony does anything um I mean I don't know how much I would want to change things at the state level but I just want to get us out of the business of weighing in on things that we really don't have any ability to weigh in on we have no discretion so uh you know my initial goal was to get out of 100% of this um but I have definitely heard that a nuanced approach is appropriate based on our rules and law and the fact that there there's a lot of this could be discretionary if they make an exception to that clear and objective standards so I appreciate the work you've done I appreciate us moving forward on this I I've heard that in other communities uh they've also had similar opinions when they're frustrated by like our lack of true power or discretion and I I think people push back because they think that you know their their speech or testimony is being limited but like that speech doesn't go anywhere that doesn't go to Luba that's not captured that doesn't go to the next body that actually weighs in on this so you know at the risk of giving wrong legal advice not an attorney I I'm of the opinion you should if you want to appeal this you should you know appeal it formally at a minimum to your neighborhood association uh an actual application but you probably need a land use attorney because if you don't get somebody who knows what they're talking about you're making points to nobody like you've got to focus on the criteria and the criteria aren't always intuitive and it usually takes a bit of a law degree to understand it thank you councelor further discussion councelor Hoy thank you Mr Mayor uh one of the pieces of written um testimony was submitted by the uh Elna the East Lancaster neighborhood association and it was brought up in paragraph three or so that this I'm sorry paragraph four um were were neighborhood associations consulted on this at all or given the opportunity to weigh in um at the committee meetings we did receive uh I believe testimony from the West Salem neighborhood association I will freely you know say that it wasn't we didn't Outreach to the neighborhood associations and and tell them what the committee was going to be considering is it would it be possible to delay and host a work session of some kind and I mean I'm stealing directly from this letter would it be possible to delay and holder work sessions so that neighborhood associations could be notified and given the opportunity to speak their mind that is certainly within council's prerogative councelor Phillips I heard that this process will involve that though I I what I heard in the roll out of this discussion was that what we're initiating would involve going out to the neighborhood association specifically am I did I hear incorrectly I I think I think I will probably be part of that process uh but it's going to be a planning effort so I would defer to Kristen Rutherford and Lisa Anderson oi Kristen Rutherford is going to defer this to Lisa Anderson ooi oh the ball's rolling down the hill not it not it okay Unice is she up next I was so excited to hear what Kristen was gonna say um good evening Lis sers will be your planning administrator uh we we did meet with a few other neighborhoods who um hosts a group of neighborhood uh land use chairs called the land use Network and she invited us I don't have my notes with me but I feel like five or six neighborhoods were represented there so um I did have a zoom meeting with them a few months ago to kind of explain the proposal and get their feedback but beyond that have not been to any neighborhood associations um but we can definitely go to Neighborhood chairs um have another land use meeting I don't know that we can commit to going to all 18 neighborhoods on the proposal but we can definitely reach out to them and have some work sessions or staff meetings with them and we would do that as part of the Outreach or we could do that before if you don't vote on it tonight um as far as the Outreach if you do vote for us to go forward we will then start work on the amendment which you know we'll start drafting the changes and and have a more robust um proposal to show people but we'll have to do that work first thank you Council Nisha thank you mayor Hoy um being I have eight neighborhood associations one of which I don't go to but I know my fellow counselor does I know that they do know about this so it's not like it's not been available to them um because they've spoken uh about it at the meetings and then also um have basically I'm just letting you know that I would say that the majority if not all have already heard thank you Council Phillips yeah um I would prefer that we were to give staff the direction and",

        "text": " together from this committee uh addressed those areas that was in statute carried over to rule so we're not where there's nothing there are no uh scoring criteria items that are being changed or removed uh we're just looking at creating line items scoring over key project details and then you'll see in the next slide over some of the equity details so that we're not looking at these lump sum scores uh these would be scored on specific aspects related aspects as the reviewers go through a particular project so these there's no questions being changed on the application there's no other scoring criteria that are being removed we may have some point adjustments on some of those other line items to help create that even consistency across applications and project types but in this case the idea to move the resilient aspect up it was its own question and or its own line item score within the resilience projects for planning and Construction in this iteration we're looking at bringing that into the project strength area because it's a it's an overriding goal of the program and making that a part of the project strength the scoring category but then also including it across all projects and all four opportunity announcements and so and that did that answer your question or well let me add in a little Jason just the you know back to the definitions of resilience and you know separating out resilience related to the community and EJ communities versus technical they really are combined and you'll that's in the definitions too where the um let's I'll just read it right out of the definition where the community energy resilience means the ability of a community to maintain the availability of energy needed to support the provision of energy dependent critical public services to the community following non-routine disruptions of severe impact or duration to the state's broader Energy Systems both combining Public Welfare service and the technical aspects of providing that power in a grid outage and yes there are other questions though that get more into the details and scoring that get more into the details of the support and involvement of the environmental justice and then one other part again is that yes that there are included in the scoring of this is not just yes this is a resilience-based object there's they're obviously in the application that's there's going to be technical information about that project or planned project that also goes to weight into a reviewer's assessment and scoring of of the resilience aspects and with each of these individual items as well great that's that's really helpful um context and clarification the um the ability the the steps you've taken to to break out those uh those multiple points I think will be very helpful for for um and I I think some of the some of the the context um that you're providing I imagine it will probably show up in the in the longer form document um kind of where are you you're describing what you mean by what information is you want to be provided in each of these sections for instance under the under the current the current NF uh model um you know operations plan is listed um that's not really it's not really clear what that means and are we talking about how the facility is going to be operated once it's constructed or are you talking about how the team is going to be operating things like that so providing some some clarity in what's what is um what's the intended information and then what what a uh we'll get you a higher score versus a lower score because I imagine it's not all or nothing in any of these yeah and so two two things with that Jimmy is that um obviously in our scoring criteria packed into the OAS the the the description of the line item is you know is always going to be condensed to the basics of what uh you would be we would be looking at and that our competitive reviewers would be scoring um but I think also as one piece of this we are looking at uh we're looking at updating that those descriptions as well to provide even more clarity of exactly what are we talking about versus the information on the application that we'll be looking at and then scoring and then lastly on your very last comment the you know our aim in the program is not to uh it's not necessarily to uh to guide scores with very very specific if it's this this is the score if it's this this is the score there's uh you know part of the program is to bring in those competitive reviewers uh that have that have asked to be a part of that review and utilize their experiences their backgrounds their take on these applications and projects and bring their own scoring within our guidelines to those final scores and within that we feel like we get a very balanced we get a very balanced and wide ranging assessment of these scores and that's probably also a good thing to just make sure we like to keep saying this within the program especially with our public hears that the crap program grantees are not selected by Odo and specific we have a competitive review made up of citizens and internal reviewers within C rep that go through and do these reviews of the projects score these and then we put those score Matrix together so I need I want to add that engine because I always like to keep throwing that out I think some people don't always understand how these projects within syrup are actually selected in the end thank you and do we have uh any other comments on the project strength side of this uh of this discussion for a potential okay we'll go ahead and move into the next one I know we're running just a little bit uh over on our time so uh clay if you could go to the next screen and uh similar to the project strength um in our program priorities or Equity category and our scoring criteria in the OAS our current setup is uh on our renewable only projects we have a total sport 15 or a combined total score of 15 and on the resilience projects a combined score of 10 points and in this section we have that location the community the community served the community leadership involved in the projects not just the project team that we saw in Project strength Community Partnerships and Outreach as well as an equity framework and one of the things we're exploring here is similar to project strength where we would be taking the Rel the related areas of that those equity and EJ Community Based questions and combining them again in single line item scoring to create that even and consistent scoring across the group of of questions and responses we receive for these particular items as they relate back to our Equity program priorities and age and service of EJ communities so we'll open it up in the same if anyone has any uh question or comments from our members here on this area while we're waiting on maybe a particular question come in with our committee members if we could use the chat and if you feel like either of these exploring these and then getting some more information on what the team is exploring and looking at but see that there might be some value in this and and agree that at least looking at that as a change might be a positive here if you could use the chat and use one of the icons and give us a thumbs up or potentially even give us a thumbs down there just so we can get some engagement from our members today and Jason while they're doing that Jennifer Jolly is asking in the chat um do you publish who the reviewers are and do they vary each round uh we do within each round we do have um we do have some reviewers that come back on um that we have had uh two or three reviewers that have that were involved in both uh round one and round two um within that we intentionally tried uh in round two to move them into different categories that they were not involved in in the first round but our our process is is that you have to apply to be uh to be an external reviewer for the C rep program uh and in terms of publishing uh who the reviewers are um no that's it's not something uh we keep our the internal records out there uh these are always going to be private citizens that come and apply for them and so uh uh they come in and give us their best and unbiased opinions and then we take those scores and move them into our system to get our final score results from both our external reviewers and the uh selected internal Odo we also have a public process of volunteering to be an external reviewer um and so you know that's always posted on our website when that opportunity is announced and all the criteria and details of that are posted okay well for the for the sake of time and making sure that we have some time for our public commentary uh we can always with the committee uh have you have more maybe a little more time to digest this and uh and maybe communicate back via email in a comments or ideas but clay if we can go ahead and move into the next slide Jason oh I'm sorry I can't see all the screens on there and then uh Alessandro's done with her question I've gotta I'm gonna take a question from Toby on from the chat so go ahead Alessandro yeah I just mostly wanted to um Clarity on this adjustment so it used to be that uh the categories were all just lumped together and would get a total of 10 or 15 points for whether it's resilience or renewable and now you're actually breaking them up into the five five two point five um is there a reason why the equity framework was a 2.5 um it's also a little bit hard for my brain to capture things when I don't know exactly like what questions are being asked right for like the EJ community outreach or plan what makes a really good one what makes you know not a really good one um and so just wanting to get a little bit more context of like um yeah why the equity framework is 2.5 but also like what does the equity framework mean um for Odo and when other reviewers are going through the applications yeah and I think um so first off is that breaking this up really just allows based on the related information and response in the application for that particular item such as is this located in an environmental justice Community is this is primarily served in is this project primarily serving environmental justice Community which would be the impact on that Community um and that would become that single score combined single score item um and then the same example through uh the Outreach or the plan to engage the public and and the current iteration as you you know as you described we can have reviewers going through you know 12 to 15 questions with a lot of information that's that's revolving",

        "text": " them out in the field. The department is so much more stabilized today compared to four or five years ago. That doesn't mean we don't have any more challenges, which we deal with on a daily basis, and we move forward. We have a budget session coming up. We have a strategic planning workshop coming up. A lot of plans and ideas will be discussed, and we keep moving forward. And I think it's important to note, Mister Nechtel, that this isn't just a Marion county problem. This is an industry wide problem. It's happening all over the state. It's happening all over the nation. I'm only interested in Marion County. I understand that, but it's not just a Marion county problem. It's happening everywhere. There just are not as many people going into the fire services as there used to be. There's not as many people going into the. There'll be less and less all the public safety entities, yes. And so from a commission standpoint, we're doing everything that we can to recruit and retain good, qualified employees. We want people, when they come to Marion county and they sign on the dot and they put that uniform on that they're planning on staying with us until they retire. That's the most important thing. That's what we are trying to do, and that's what we're trying to build here. There are some things that are just completely out of our control, such as the fact that there just aren't as many people going into the service anymore. I know that. And I can see with our nine grandchildren that none of our kids will ever think about fire. The police department, the attitude of the young folks is so different from us. When I was involved with the Boy Scouts, everybody wanted to be a policeman or a fireman. Water change in the world, and it's not going to get any better. I was at one of the, actually two of the fire houses on Sunday, the day before Christmas, and it was one of individuals working unexpectedly another 24 hours. That just bugged me. I didn't ask him any questions. But it's rough on the family. If you have wife and kids, it's nice to see them now and then, not to come home and have to sleep for 24 hours to wake up. And it's important that the employees, the fire department, especially at a rescue, is in good smarts and bright. I mean, they're able to handle a situation, whether it's a fire or a rescue, you know? Absolutely. We 100% agree with you. And I think that there are going to be some suggestions made in the coming year that might help alleviate some of that mandatory overtime. Well, God bless you and I hope you will do well. Thank you. Happy new year. Madam chair. Yes, Mister Netale. You make accusations about the board not being in support of right to life. That's what I do. I'll be glad to give you a personal letter. I'm not interested in a personal level. I'm looking for the county commissioners to be together. What I want to follow up on my comments is that this is a state and national issue. How we individually feel is one thing, but I've been listening to the presidential debates in Iowa. There's one tonight they bring up the abortion issue. They all vary on how they feel about it. DeSantis, heartbeat bill and so forth, you know, and you compare it to the animal services issue, which we have a full department that. That we are obligated to take care of. And I don't think you can marry those two together at all. We have an obligation to the taxpayers because of the department we run on that. The other, we could send a letter to whomever and it's going to fall on deaf ears. Really? Let us fall on deaf ears. You're making a stance I don't want to get into debated argument. I'm tired of you coming up here. I've had a personal discussion with you. You know where I stand and making an allegation where people are listening, streaming into this meeting. And you're making an assumption that these commissioners are not in support of a right to life, and I don't think that's correct. But make a standard, spend more time individually with the commissioners, one on one, understanding where their positions are. And before you come up and make an accusation like that, I like you personally. I think you do a lot of good when you come up with your ideas and so forth, but to make an accusation like that, I don't appreciate very honestly. Well, what I see is a million babies are being aborted. They would be Americans. We're bringing many, many millions of people over the border, yet we can't stop the babies being aborted. Look, this board can't stop it. I know somebody that will support our governor. We can support our president if they support our positions, but that one's beyond that. It's one that has split the country right down the middle, unfortunately. But I just. When you start making the accusation against these commissioners and myself, that's not a well founded accusation. Well, I'm telling you how I feel. I feel that you guys could do more. I mean, I see many correspondence between us and Tallahassee for this and that. Well, can I finish? Yeah, you go ahead. If you can wrap up, though. Yes, because we need to move along. There's always correspondence between you and Tallahassee. When was the last time you even brought up abortions? Or the heartbeat bill, which is another fake. I mean, so far they think we got the heartbeat built. Well, we don't. Tallahassee is not in the mindset to pass anything like that. And even the ten or 15 weeks that we have, if a woman comes in and she says, I'm only five weeks or six weeks, she may be eight months, but they go. She's only eight. You know, they go by what you say, you know, the heartbeat bill would be a technical thing where they could do an electronic device to prove or disprove whether there's a heartbeat. Thank you, Mister Nechtel, and I'm sorry for all the trouble you're causing. I just. I mean, I'm causing, but I'm really frustrated with the fact that I know that God's not happy with this at all. And if there's one good reason to stop us and flood this country, it would be that one. We failed, I think. Thank you, Mister Nechtel. Is there anyone else you would like to speak? Anybody else who'd like to give public comment today? All right, I'm going to go ahead and close public comment and bring us into item number 13, which will be commissioner items. So, commissioner, comments since you were ready just a second ago, Commissioner Zalig. Well, you know, Mister Necktail has certainly heard us as we run for office many times. And so, I mean, it doesn't. I mean, of course I'm pro life and been pro life the whole time. So in case you wanted to know, there it is. But the second thing, I think one of the things that we are doing is because we do care about life in that form, is we have commissioned every one of our new fire stations to be equipped with, and one is getting built up in Citra and we'll have some other ones, but with the baby box. And so what that is, is that just in case someone has a baby and for someone unknown reason, they need to drop that baby off or something happens or it's in a bad circumstance, then we have a. A place where they can put that in. It sends alarms, they can leave without being notified, but the baby would be kept safe in a box, which is a cradle inside the fire station. And that's set up to make sure that we could support life in its most fragile times. I know that in the one in Ocala that we helped to partner on as they were building theirs, that one has saved at least one life that I know of. And especially what I found to be so important and thank the board for their support in, is putting these out, especially in stations that are in rural areas, like up in citra, like up in salt springs and around those other areas. And as we add them, because a lot of times, you know, that incident may not happen in the city of Ocala, but it might happen in one of the rural areas, or even if people know that it's there, they might come from a different outlying county and one of our stations are on the line off a mile or two and they might bring them to us because they know they can drop that baby off and it would be secure and we would take care of them. So, commissioner, I think that this board continues to show its support for life in the ways that we can. And I believe that it's been a year. I thought I saw an article recently on the baby that had been dropped in that box in Ocala, and I believe it's been a year. I think that was the anniversary article. So, yeah, that was a great story. Commissioner McLean? No, I think I was going to make some comments, but I think Commissioner Curry, Commissioner Zalick have covered it. That is disappointing to hear someone come up and try to accuse us of not being pro life. In my career before this, in the legislature, we. I helped the first senate sponsor file that heartbeat bill. I helped draft that language. We also were the sponsor of that surrendered newborn infant bill when I was working with Senator Baxley that helped get that baby box here in Ocala so I could go on and on. Us sending a letter up there doesn't help start a conversation. That conversation is already happening, so it's not our",

minute and then we'll we'll get started thank you for joining us though well it looks like we're leveling off in numbers so we'll go ahead and get started uh welcome everybody to today's webinar on the Oregon Department of Energy's biennial Energy report uh thanks so much for for joining us to learn more about what's in this year's my name is Andy Cameron I'm the Energy Efficiency and conservation manager here at the Oregon Department of the energy or Odo as we call ourselves I'll be your MC today that I'll be joined by a number of authors on this I do want to start today by acknowledging that indigenous tribes and bands have been with the the lands that we inhabit today in the Willamette Valley and throughout Oregon in the Northwest for time immemorial as the late Coquille Chief Don Ivey once said Oregon has been home to tribal people before there was an Oregon um odo's offices are in Salem in the land of the calapuya who today are represented by the confederated tribes of the Grand Ronde and the confederated tribes of the silets Indians in whose relationship with this land continues to this day so here's our agenda for the day the purpose of our webinar is to introduce you all to the report's content through a brief orientation of each section we'll start with a bit of background on the report and the process we use to scope and draft it will then provide an overview for each of the report sections there's energy by the Numbers the history timeline resource and Technology reviews energy 101 and policy briefs we'll end by touching on a few of the topics that are covered in multiple sections and then talk about some of the next steps and end with hopefully some time for your questions and we'll have a little bit of room for questions along the way as I'll explain here in just a uh you also might hear us refer to this report as the the Burr which to us stands for biennial integer report it's become a fodder for a lot of puns around here we're trying to break ourselves of the acronym habit but uh 2022 Burr got shortened to tuber and the potato jokes sort of flowed and we hope that you'll engage with this during this presentation through the chat function you can find that at the bottom right of your screen using that feel free to submit questions to either me or the Odo team through this chat box my colleague Jessica Rikers she's monitoring these uh chats and we'll either assign your question to one of the staff to answer uh she'll ask it to the speaker if it's a clarifying question or perhaps she'll suggest it be addressed at the end of the webinar we're recording this webinar and the questions so if we don't get to yours during the webinar we'll do our best to find an answer and follow up with you if you have any technical issues you can submit them through the chat box if that's still working for you and we'll get someone to try and help you as quickly as we can Jessica is monitoring the chat and so feel free to pop any questions or technical issues in there we'll respond and uh or either look look for an opportunity to ask the question later in the so in this presentation we're also going to do a little bit of polling uh there'll be a few times during the webinar where a question will pop up on the right side of your screen and it might say slido on it we hope you'll answer those questions because these polls are going to allow us to have a little bit of a Choose Your Own Adventure webinar today about three three points in the presentation the audience gets to decide which direction we go with topics um lastly I'm sure you've all experienced this in the the more virtual workspace that we're all now in but technical difficulties internet glitches uh who knows what's possible those all may occur we're coming to you from our Salem office our home offices living rooms kitchens if you're lucky if you may even get to see some of our kids and pets surely a cat or two will make their appearance uh but we really appreciate you joining us and having the opportunity to share this report with you today we're we're quite proud of it and we look forward to introducing you to it so before we launch into the report itself a few words about the Oregon Department of energy you'll see here our mission statement and the way we talk about the work we do within the the five broad categories that you see here the biennial Energy report or the Burr is a key product that the agency uses to help oregonians make informed decisions about energy it's also emblematic of several of the bullets you see under the the what we do it's a central place for Oregon's energy data information and Analysis can be used for for energy education technical assistance and really in helping oregonians with their energy challenges so why did we write this thing in the first place well in in 2017 the legislature passed House Bill 2343 which charged the department with developing a report every two years to inform local state Regional and Federal Energy policy development and energy planning and this report which is based on analysis of data information a whole lot of analysis of data and information that's collected and compiled by Odo and provides a comprehensive review of energy resources policies Trends and forecasts and really what they mean for and as you'll see as we we go through them the sections Target different maybe you're someone who already has experience with Energy Efficiency so skip ahead to the policy briefs on those topics maybe you don't know much about backup power or long duration energy storage so you can spend some time learning about that in the 101 section if you're new to Oregon or energy in general I think the history timeline is a great place to familiarize yourself with the key events that really help shape Oregon's Energy System and this this slide details the the overall table of contents for the report as you can see the the authors tackled a really robust selection of topics uh we feel strongly that this Burr truly offers something for every reader so with that introduction in mind uh let's let's dive in um we'll start with energy by the numbers and this is a similar format to what many of you might have seen in the the 2020 report so you can compare charts and graphs really across the years which we hope is is useful for you the purpose of energy by the numbers is to to Really provide the facts and the figures on Oregon's overall and sector-based energy use energy production and generation and energy energy by the Numbers focuses on the the metrics and data available to track how Oregon produces purchases and uses various types of energy and you can see in the the table of contents for this section on this slide all of the different topics we cover in energy by the numbers and so too to to tell you more and I think we can probably Advance this slide uh thank you to tell you more about what energy Oregon Imports produces and exports and how to read this uh rather crazy looking diagram here at Odo we refer to it as the squid the proper name is a Sankey chart that we've really grown to love it uh but anyway to to tell you more about it is Stephanie Cruz she's a facilities engineer and our planning and Innovation Division and she's going to take the mic she'll also talk a little bit about some of the trends and what's new in the energy by the Numbers section so Stephanie over to you thanks Andy hi everyone I'm excited to share some of the highlights from energy by the Numbers section um developing this section is always a delight to my engineering sensibilities so if you like me want to examine the numbers and the charts I encourage you to dive in online and read through this this chart represents the flow of energy and organ from energy produced in state energy imported to the state energy converted for electricity generation in the state all the way through to sector energy use and energy exports and this data is based on the 2020 calendar year the data comes from several sources including eia generation sector consumption data and Oregon Department of Energy's own electricity resource mix and transportation Transportation fuel analysis most of the energy that Oregon produces in state is renewable including Hydro wind and biomass while Oregon's energy Imports are primarily either fossil fuel based raw fuels or electricity that is generated from fossil fuels the energy we produce and import helps meet various needs from in-state electricity generation to Transportation to the natural gas and electricity that Supply homes and businesses some energy ultimately goes unused due to system inefficiencies and some is exported to other states organson overall trend of increased energy use for almost four decades an average of 3.6 growth per year from 1960 to 1999. during that time the state shifted from a Reliance on fuel oil and wood to an increased use of natural gas and electricity in homes and businesses Oregon reached its highest consumption of energy in 1999 in both stationary and transportation uses since then total energy use has been decreasing the amount of energy used in Oregon declined by 13.4 percent between 2000 and 2020. energy consumption per capita does not directly correlate with overall energy use in the last 20 years Oregon has seen a steady population increase during a period of slight decline in the overall energy consumption translating to a steady decrease in energy consumption per capita Energy Efficiency Remains the second largest resource in the Pacific Northwest after hydropower the Northwest power and conservation council's 2021 Northwest power plant concludes the cost-effective Energy Efficiency can continue to meet a large amount of new low growth in the region however Energy Efficiency achievement has been on a downward Trend due to many factors including the pandemic flat to declining investments in Energy Efficiency and increasing costs of Energy Efficiency Solutions or oregonians spent less in on energy in 2020 than in 2018 mostly due to the effects of the kobit 19 pandemic on Transportation fuel consumption Transportation field costs are the largest variable in Oregon's energy expenditures with global crude oil market prices being the major Market of the ",

        "text": "good morning everyone i think we can get um thank you again for joining today my name is mai buchanan and i'm the senior climate policy analyst at the oregon department of energy or odo today we will be discussing the oregon global warming commission's roadmap to i'm leading this process to conduct the plan and supporting the commission and its work to adopt recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in and i'll be kicking off today's meeting with support from assistant director of planning and innovation alan selenka as well as christy split and linda ross for our meeting today we have a few key one is we'd like to provide everyone with an overview of the process and analysis involved to develop the oregon global warming commission's roadmap to second we want to provide a more detailed overview of the modeling process that's being used to support this work and finally most importantly we want to get your feedback on the draft list of actions to be modeled so we'll start off with some administrative housekeeping and then we'll walk through the process of developing the roadmap and then i'll pass it on to our consultants from sustainability solution groups or ssg who will then be providing an overview of their emissions modeling process and facility engagement on the draft list of so for the meeting today alan and i and colleagues from ssg will serve as your panelists and my colleagues christy and linda will be providing support by monitoring the chat and addressing any technical issues that you might have we also wanted to share that some moto staff recently participated in the diversity equity inclusion conference for the state and we found we really appreciated the community agreements that they used so we've carried those over here and i'll just cover a few of them briefly but this is to help foster an inclusive discussion for the meeting today so we hope that we can all be present and ready to learn be respectful of others and their views um we think that you know learning happens outside of comfort zones and really we're here to listen and learn so thank you for that and now i'll go over some meeting logistics briefly so first off we are already recording today's meeting and we'll make it available on the oregon global warming commission's website the link to which chrissy will be dropping in the chat so if you scroll down to about midway through that website under resources or closer to the stakeholder meeting information you can find the draft list of actions that we'll be discussing today second we're asking everyone to please introduce yourself in the chat with your name your organization and the sentence about why you're interested in this work you can also use the chat to ask so you can ask questions while we're presenting material if you have questions about the material that we're currently covering something you don't understand or need to be clarified christy will let us know at an appropriate pause and then we'll answer that question the best that we can in a moment any other questions can be held to the discussion so when we get to that period it'd be really helpful if you can jot down the number of the slide that you're referring to in case it's helpful for us to go back we've also set aside the final 40 minutes of the meeting for discussion so when we get to that time chrissy will also remind us of questions that were in the chat that um that you know should be brought up at that period and we will have an opportunity for a live activity again that will be facilitated by ssg for other questions and comments for those of you not familiar with webex welcome i wanted to point out some key features that you might want to use at the bottom right you can see the chat you can use this to send a message to everyone in the meeting such as when asking a question and you can also send a private message to linda ross who is our meeting host if you're having live technical issues um at the bottom middle of the webex window you can find a reactions button and that's where you can use the the raise hand button and you can also raise your hand by clicking on the hand next to your name in the participant list and again please remember that we'll be using the raised hand function in the discussion part of today's so i'll now pass it on to alan zlanka for a few words thank you alan thank you maya thank you all for joining us today we had a great group yesterday and looks like we're getting another good great group today so thank you for your participation in this meeting um this slide shows our new mission and what we do statements um your participation will actually directly contribute to our mission to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system and the tigger project will help us advance a set of climate actions that will make up will make the global warming commission's roadmap up to 2035 and that will in turn help us fulfill the rest of our mission next slide please what is the roadmap to 2035 next slide my mind's not advancing is yours uh mine is i can see oh this happens maybe there's a little delay there yeah it's a little delayed wonders of technology so ultimately what we want to create a plan with recommended actions across all the sectors of the economy that will help oregon achieve its climate goals for consideration by the governor legislature and other policy makers so how do we do that that's the question if you think of the current level of greenhouse gas emissions that oregon will emit without any policies programs or actions it's a relatively flat line maybe a little going up maybe a little going down but it's represented by that business as usual line on the graphic to the to the right on the slide then there'll be all the new policies programs and actions that the state will or is taking to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions like the climate protection program from deq that will limit emissions from large stationary sources transportation fuels and natural and another one would be the expansion of the clean fuels program which decreases the carbon intensity of fuels from our current goal of 10 percent by 2025 to 25 by 2035 and another one would be hb 2021 which will dramatically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from retail electricity and that will result in a 90 reduction below baseline emissions by 2035 and 100 below baseline emissions by so we call all of those actions um are our planned actions and we call that our plan as business line that's the middle line there and that lowers our our greenhouse gas emissions significantly and through that yellow portion of the graph but it doesn't quite get us to the target line which for our greenhouse gas emission goal reduction goal and that's the bottom line on the graph called the decarbonization pathway so the ticker project is the work to figure out what further actions we need to take to fill that gap between the business's usual line and the decarbonization pathway that's the purple section of the graph so trigger project is a set in essence a gap analysis what actions do we need to the gap to to close that gap between the two lines and meet our goals so with all of those accidents identified through the tigger project we can then with the global warming commission create the plan to meet our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and that will be the roadmap to 2035. so explain a little bit more detail about the tigger's six steps that we're going through to get to the road map i'll turn it back to mine thanks so much alan uh so as alan just noted there's six key components in the process developed to develop the roadmap to 2035 which we'll be walking through here and together we're referring to this process as the tigger project and you may be wondering already what a map curve is and we'll be explaining that momentarily so the oregon global warming commission is serving as a steering committee for this process and analysis to develop the and odo supporting this work by providing analysis and project the consultant's work focuses on the first four components of the process to develop the roadmap this work involves identifying actions that can significantly reduce emissions or sequester carbon as well as evaluating the greenhouse gas reduction potential and the cost effectiveness of such it also includes developing mac curves and analyzing the associated co benefits that will help enable an equitable clean energy transition the analysis and findings will provide a suite of ambitious transformative and financially realistic decarbonization actions and pathways that can be used to reach or exceed the target of 45 reductions below 1990 levels by 2035. so task one involves gathering and distilling the background information and conferring with state agencies and to solicit input and ideas about what those new actions could be task two involves where we are now developing the list of actions so we are developing a broad list of potential actions that can be modeled and determining the greenhouse gas potential of those actions and really their cost effectiveness over a period of time and these actions span a diverse array of sectors and this work largely focus focuses on in-state emissions and chair mcdonald from the oregon global orienting commission is here with us today and she is going to add just a few words now about how this work is addressing the natural working land sector thank you maya the oregon global warming commission adopted a proposal this summer for a goal for increased sequestration and natural and working lands we are hoping over the next course of the next year to develop a process for tracking our progress towards that we will look at the opportunities for increased uh in natural and working lands against that that outcome goal so and we'll be able to use some of the information that the commission used to set goals to help us understand the climate mitigation benefits of different types based on research that's been done in oregon and elsewhere thank you and task 3 is what i was referring to earlier the marginal abatement cost or mat curves by sector so what is a mac curve mac curves are just an indicator to help us evaluate both the mitigation potential and the cost effectiveness of an action over a period of time they show the total greenhouse gas emissions reduced by an action divided by the net present value of that action so an action's net present value is the discounted sum of the capital and operating costs of the action over its it's the difference between the present value of the capital investment and the present value of the future stream of payments savings revenue generated by that investment so really in a",

        "text": " just in case you didn't see it it looks like janet put her um contact information in there about the planning department and dlcd grant deadline i'm not sure if anyone from um the ports or any of the ports are on the line but you're welcome to sort of raise your hand or add to the chat if you have some more specific knowledge about some of these themes from the comments based on your experience working um with a port in oregon checking to see if we have any raised so a bit of a pause here i'm not seeing any raised hands any more questions or comments in the chat that are of interest to share out um just a reminder on some of the prompts that we have on these themes if there's information or perspectives that differ from the the themes that we've seen from comments so far if there's elaboration or emphasis on a different aspect of one of these comments or if you have ideas for future study or engagement based on some of these or you know just some new thoughts that aren't here oh i do see another um comment or question here in the chat from mark could you discuss faa approval requirements for assembly of turbines near airports i might not be the best person um we did get some comments i mean it was educational to me um like i remember 200 feet sticking out in my in my mind right now just off the top of my head um but it was flagged um did i have that maybe that was back in the sighting and permitting section on on the height restrictions and it's been identified like i think there's some different approaches for the coos bay i think i heard some feedback about this in the context of the coos bay area like a south a south and north you know maybe there's a smaller airport to the south and a more local port port airport to the north um and then i think there was yeah some some constraints around that and maybe um some modifications to rules and regulations or like conditional use or you know i'm kind of out of my element do you remember jason um that there was a recently published study on the coos bay port um simply blue was associated with it um i think it's been made public and it might address some of these questions as well yeah our next guest um and that that's gonna get flagged in our next topic um economic development i think um but yeah we do have links to that and that i haven't had a time to give that a really deep dive and thorough review i'm sure it's in there there might even be like a graphic to help visualize but yeah that's a good question it's being looked at yeah thanks for adding that to the sort of slate of perspectives here it helps us to understand might be what might be helpful um to put in the report as well i see that uh there was a a note that walter chuck um is on the phone with the last uh digits are 4919 his hand raised i'm wondering if our host um could un annum so he could ask his question or make his comment uh the last four digits were four nine one nine not seeing that number um so we'll keep looking for that and i'll go to janet's question in the chat while we continue to look she's worried about the emf from power cables on the sea floor connecting the turbines to land and that she is referencing a study in scotland that showed it to be very harmful to crabs and she's wondering whether that would be studied here and i'm maybe going to clarify studied in this oregon department of energy report and it might also be helpful for whitney or andy to talk about whether that might be um studied in a different part of the process related to citing and permitting so first i'll go to jason to talk about whether it would be studied in this report and then maybe have whitney or andy comment on that too if they're available um yeah it might get flagged i don't know if if that would rise up to um you know being called out specifically i think it'd probably be referenced more generally like with a host of concerns you know related to citing and permitting of cables um there will be a reference to um i can't remember the house bill or the senate bill but um yeah andy andy may have had a reference to it in his um i think there's an active state body kind of whether it's a task force or something but somebody's looking at cabling cabling specifically which would include offshore wind cabling yeah hi richie um can you repeat the kind of the big gem of the question for me sure no problem um janet was worried about the emf from power cables on the seafloor connecting the turbines to land and she referenced a study in scotland showing that it might be harmful to crabs she was wondering whether that would be studied here and i just wanted to clarify our study here at the oregon department of energy isn't doing sort of like original study rather it's focused on identifying what is in the existing literature and gathering perspectives from stakeholders but we were also wondering whether that issue might be studied in a different part of the process through the permitting inciting yeah thanks that's that's a great i think we would look to guidance and review on the topic from our department of fish and wildlife analysis of either existing literature on west coast studies that have been but to understand potential impacts and to speak specifically about the study of of cables our department has been tasked with taking a look at the part of our territorial sea plan which turn on my video here um which th which helps the state establish a pathway for the sighting and permitting of cables that cross the territorial sea and land on our shores that is uh that task was established by house 2603 in the 2021 legislative session we are just getting that underway with the successful hire of a undersea cable coordinator and we are establishing a working group uh which will be a subcommittee of the ocean policy advisory council to help provide advice uh to us in the conduct of that study so that is just beginning and that may be one of the issues that going back to the effects of crab the group highlights thanks for that question thanks andy go ahead i'm just gonna add i um my colleague uh abigail ryder just put a couple links into the chat as well bulma has funded a few studies at looking at um potential impacts from from emf and i believe the study referenced in the chat was on brown crab offshore scotland i'm trying to under you know i think they detected response but but not necessarily um you know and maybe not an impact or an effect for that the um i think mark referenced earlier with the seer project some of the one of those topic areas specific on on enf which um might be helpful and then um we i had this question come up a couple of weeks ago and trying to you know what signature might look like and i think the preference of having a c cable um understanding that you know that i think it was an example from um an environmental impact statement on the east coast for a bird cable so again this is we don't fully know what what would be proposed for these projects but taking the examples for what has been reviewed and approved on the east coast is seeing a very small emf signature for bird cables and in this in this example with the vineyard wind project i think it was 0.05 micro um which was a order of magnitude excuse me an order of magnitude less than the um sort of threshold that was used for the brown crab study if that's helpful to put into perspective thanks whitney um i see a hand raised from mike i wanted to make sure that we could unmute mike so he could make his comment or ask his question yeah um thank you i don't understand the advantage or even the potential for multiple ports if the main purpose of the port on the coast is to assemble these turbines and get them out to see how you would structure something out of multiple ports to to do that unless there's something i'm missing about the work process involved maybe you could fill me in on that one thanks mike if i recall um from our kickoff meeting jason talked a little bit about some of the port pieces and the um draft literature review it's not necessarily a specialty of oregon department of energy but based on the literature it sounds like there's a number of different permutations or options depending on the ports themselves jason do you want to add a little bit more yeah i mean i think it's an open question i mean we just received a lot of feedback kind of looking at it from both sides of the you both sides of the kaleidoscope or whatever um you know so on one side you have like maybe you've got existing ports that don't need to be upgraded as much and existing labor around those ports that you know could support this you know in a more timely fashion or without without recruitment or something um but then you might have the distance trade-off maybe therefore those ports are further away from the location they need to be deployed from or maybe there's synergistic benefits you know niches that people are better in certain ports than others um maybe it maybe it's multiple spots maybe it's not like a zero sum maybe multiple forts are working on the same thing you know it kind of depends on the scale too you know if this scales up really big then you know maybe there's going to be more than one ports just to support that activity so i think there's more work and studying on this it it might it might go different directions thanks jason um we're going to need to move to the next topic but i did want to um speak to the comment that ron peace has in the chat because it actually is a great segue he said it seems advantageous to explore scenarios that maximize local economic development or benefits such as job with requirements for apprenticeship and wage standards found in hb 2021 seems like having local port be a part of the construction fabrication and supply chain would be advantageous to oregon and coastal and port thanks for that that comment it's a actually a great segue to our next topic thanks everyone for the um comments and additional feedback and questions about port infrastructure and sea vessels like we've said um we're gonna have some time at the end if something else comes up on you on this topic and we continue to welcome written feedback through",

        "text": " PR east hiatus. Mister McLean, I'm sorry you had to put up with this in your first meeting, but this is a interesting saga that we've gone through, and I'm hoping that Mister Calloway will come up here and say that he realizes we've done everything we can and that the countryside farms is okay with it. Mister Manner, regarding Mister Gooding's comment about the walk on in the county conservation easement, somehow the grant of easement on our walk on item is actually the agreement that for our easement. Well, yeah, this was your easement or this was the thing from that 95th holdings. Yeah, that's our easement. We're not requesting that be approved. So I emailed to you the county easement. So you should have that on your screen if you want to look at it. What we are requesting on our easement, we can't do it yet because we don't know how this meeting is going to turn out, but we also have to draw a legal description on it. We would like for the county commission to authorize Mister Minner and perhaps Mister Buenos to approve that one when. With Mister Calloway's consent, of course. But the county easement you do have, and it's been approved by Mister Calloway and county staff. So you're asking for the partial termination and the approval of the county grant of easement. And actually on that point on the county easement, in talking to the county administrator, I think Monier reasonably says, well, the county really has no interest in that hiatus property, so it would be in our best interest to just convey the whole thing to them. However, I went outside with Mister Calloway and their concern is first and foremost they want to make sure nothing is developed in there. So they want to get the conservation easement done today. If the county subsequently wants to convey the fee simple title to that, they're not. I don't think they're opposed to that. But they want to get the conservation easement today. You can't do it because it's right away. You first have to abrogate the road because of the reverters statute 306 point. Whatever says that it's the sole means to abrogate roads. 336. Otherwise we'd be asking for it to come back to us to revert or indeed to Mister Calloway. Well, under the statute, we've already sent out the letters to utility companies. We have to get no objection, letters from utility companies and neighboring property owners. Then we can apply to abrogate it when you all abrogate it under 300 3609. I think it comes back to us because. Because our predecessor and title was the. Was the thing. But under our partial termination, we then offered to deed it to Mister Calloway's client. Okay, but he'll have the conservation easement? Yes. And that way they can end up owning it if they want to. Or we keep owning it and it's still subject to the easement. Because in the easement we agree that it survives the vacation. So if you'll look at it, mister Minor, I think you'll find out that you all can't deed it directly to. Okay, but we've agreed to do the same thing. Okay, mister Callaway. Good afternoon. Lawrence Calloway, Klein and Klein LLC, 40 Southeast 11th Avenue, Ocala. Representing countryside Farm Owners Association. Mister gooding has done a very detailed and very thorough and very honest presentation. Our critical concern here is, one way or another, the easement is protected when we walk out the door today. I don't have authority on behalf of my client to accept conveyance. They may have concerns regarding liability or other insurance issues. I'd have to consult with them. But one way or another, as long as the 100ft on the east and the west hiatus is at least 100ft on the. The developer property on the middle hiatus needs to be protected. That's what we're looking for. Any questions of. I had one other. Go ahead. Do you have something else? No, sir. I'm sorry. John York. Afternoon, John. Good afternoon. John York. 6835 Southwest 93rd Street Road, Ocala, Florida 34476. I am a homeowner in countryside farms, and I'm not sure my questions would really apply today because a decision can't be made. So some of the questions I had were what were based on the master plan, and if we don't know where that easement is going to be yet, then my questions really don't really apply. So it's still the 100ft. Come on back up, Mister Calloway. It's 100ft from the boundary of countryside farm on the east and the west. And in the middle, it would be 100ft from the hiatus on the developer's property. So it would be different in different areas, boundaries, countryside. This is 100ft. This is also 100ft. But the middle, they only can grant an easement on what they own, which would be. So basically, you're going to have a hiatus of 25ft plus a hundred feet buffer on the developer's property. So you're actually going to be more buffered here than you would be in this. These two. Just this area. That's because it's owned by Miller. Okay. All right. But in any event, there will be at least a hundred foot buffer between countryside farm and any development that's done by the developer. Okay. All right. That goes along with the no touch. That's. I mean, that's the no touch that's in place. Right. Okay. Then a couple other questions that I have, and some of the other neighbors in the area have concerns also. Is there a timeline of when that is going to. When they're going to start the clearing and all on that property, or does it. Does it depend on the commission's approval of the master plan? Jimmy, you know that that'd be more appropriate for the master plan. Two months. Two months. But we won't be clearing in those areas. Okay. So you're basically going by the phase one, two, three and four. So you're not going to be clearing in those areas? No, sir. We're not clearing in the areas where the conservation easements are. Right, but the rest of the property, yes. That's if the county approves their master plan, which is going to be the next item to be considered. Okay. Okay. One of the other concerns that was brought up is once the clearing starts, the burning of the debris, is it going to be burned or is it going to have to be hauled away? Do we know? We'll just get all. Whatever they decide. Can we just get your questions and then when the applicant comes forward, they'll answer them? Sure. Well, actually, just keep it specific to the item that we're considering right now. So the only item that we're considering right now is the hydraulic. Then my questions I'll have to hold off on. Okay, so does countryside farms have any objection to what we are moving forward with? I don't know. I can't speak on their behalf. I'm not on the board. Okay. You're coming individually. Correct. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay, is there anyone else, anyone in the audience that would like to address 15.3.2? Mister Mitchell? Yeah. Just to answer the last question that was posed, said, did countryside have any objection? As long as they have 100 foot buffer, they have said. I provided them with copies of everything Mister Gooding has sent me. As long as they have their underfoot, no touch buffer, they're happy. Mister Minter, will you take that from Mister Calloway? Yes. I have no right. Anyone else that wants to address the commission? All right, I'll bring it back to the board. Mister chair, I think we need to understand how we're going to move forward, Guy, so we can approve the. Well, the partial termination. I would say do the walk on, you know, since there was a walk on, go through our normal drill to approve a walk on, and then that will be, you would approve the partial termination and then separately approve the conservation easement. Do I make a move to consider the walk on for fifteen, eighteen point three point two seconds. Okay, motion to consider the walk on by Commissioner Stone. Seconded by Commissioner Bryant. Comment? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Like sign. Okay, any public comment? Motion passes. Unanimous. Public comment? Any comment on the walk on back to commission? I'll move for the partial termination of 15.2 2nd. That's right. Yeah, do that first and then the easement. A motion by Commissioner stone. Seconded by Commissioner Zalak. Any comments? All in favor say aye. Aye. Close like sign. That motion passes unanimously. Conservation amusement. So, mister Minter, will you help sculpt the move on this motion. Okay, so this would be a motion to approve a grant of conservation easement from Marion county to. I don't have it in front of me. To countryside farms. Hold on just a second. Countryside farm. Hoa. Countryside farms. Hoa. And before the record, whatever the legal name is, Mister Benning, with the direction that monir and I can approve the final legal description for that easement. This easement is final. It's our easement. So this is final. This is fine. And just for the record, Mister Gooding, this will provide countryside farms with that hundred foot no touch buffer. Exactly right. Thank you. We're going to have to redesign a little",

        "text": " of Hazard Zone and downstream again very data intense we couldn't take that approach with electricity and natural gas so with those it we couldn't get into that much detail with the utility um we wanted them to actually complete the survey so we had to you know be be sensitive to everyone's schedules and so we were much higher level with the utilities whenever they would sell for report okay and then a followup question for the assessment are we looking at these energy storage facilities only is this distribution and transmission as well um is this a systemwide assessment I'm what did you start with stor like energy stor okay for the assessment are we looking at energy storage facilities only or distribution and transmission as well distribution sorry I think as as a point um you can imagine how much data and information could be collected in this set I you could look at every distribution line state every mile pipeline St um which I would love to do if they couldn't um but you know one might anyway and see it's pretty labor cost tys of exercise um so maybe in a future generation we can come up with um more refined data more specific you know I thought that ask almost like a neighborhood scale we could do something like that not quite there yet in 2024 but go future well not knowing what your results are for the seven Cal 7 U 1567 um the oil storage companies are having to do their own own risk assessments for the DEQ portion of that law so hopefully that means that you automatically had a pretty good ratio of turnout and participation by the the companies that reserve it and we did work with DEQ we worked very closely with Mike the whole time and we had great interviews with each one of the terminals and field associations their so we did get a lot of didn't have yeah it's it's great they're both part of the same bill to to find a common yeah I will say that Odo and been working together since 1567 probably was even in concept before it was passed legislation I about what for our agenes so um doing the best we can make sure we're coordinated efforts aren't duplicative but they see each other you now I have the it is coordinated excellently and there is a very kind of skin of our teeth connection there in June um that probably is going to need to be a followup kind of conversation but on June 1 those and regulated facilities are required to submit their initial assessments at risk um but how to process that your report to in September seems like might be perhaps um any any just have the T of this conversation we can see um how much work is on going in this in this sect whether fuels electricity natural gas um energy resilience and security um is an important topic a big issue there's funding there's momentum there's ideas behind it all um and so I think the best we can as state agencies to work and was vpa um since they mostly Transmission in the state did they participate not in the survey no it would have been a different entity and it wouldn't be comparison of results well that that seems like a big gap I mean they operate what three4 of the transmission in the entire state so yeah wouldn't that be a federal requirement to account I'm just cous for BPA exposure their infrastructure I think we'd have to talk about that later yeah there is um we were looking more of the distribution side the ELC distribution companies um knowing that B has we keep talking in the future well I will say to getting feedback from you will be very helpful right so we'll we'll show what the utility companies have shared and then obviously give us your perspectives on um everything they were presenting because good to know how they hand it in Washington St it's we do coordinate with our counterparts at the state level def Energy Office depart we work with them on a whole host of issues I know that they're doing a plan right now as well it just seems like the the catastrophic potential is huge if if that's not factored in I guess cly wild fire in County got right L wild anything else okay so this point let's go ahead and take five minutes and we thanks for joining we'll be back in five so at 1055 we'll come back and we'll walk through the preliminary results and get into SL e e I'm just resetting it it keeps okay all right thanks everybody we're back um I hope everyone was able to get on the slid who wants to online that's your only choice and you have a favorite Choice as well um before get into case's analysis I wanted to talk about the fuel capacity we call the SD 1567 but that's kind of the long way to say it's more about fs and talk a little bit about the work we've done in the fuel um and just I should probably all to say um you're going to see some slides of lot of information um bear with us this is you know PowerPoint for a big presentation audience our reports that eventually come out will be easier to read um and have information that's a little more user friendly shall we say and again I think some of this information uh we don't it's not going to be um as detailed on the maps as be a bunch of data but we do have um the ability to post we are trying to get um our information our GS data linked up with the state's GIS data system called Raptor it's or Emergency Management Oran Department of emgen management State GIS product map for all things natural hazards planning with emergency so we're linking up there this information will eventually be available on that website as well so talking about fuel um you know a lot of different data sources but for our mapping purposes we really relied upon uh two data sources uh DQ which regulates underground stes in the state and the Oregon State Fire Marshall which regulates above ground T of State um and they share their information with us and we have some smart GIS analysts that helped us and um this is our big reveal which may not be a lot to some people but this is really cool this is information that VI you told me you wanted to have for many years the mapped the mapped system of fuel capacity in Oregon um there's a lot of information going on here really I I think the bottom line that I want people to take away is we got some numbers um on gallons of capacity we' got locations where above and below ground tanks are are uh let me copy out this and say well I'm pointing to people on the phone on the phone can't see me excludes terminal storage capacity the terminals in Portland in Eugene and I think in illa that's particularly important so we could the map would just be one big p Shar with the tank capacity from the port um and so we we took that off really to demonstrate for visualization recognizing that there's so much storage capacity in the Portland terminals as well as Eugene and perh to lesser extent in util um some triangles show the terminals they're covered up by the pie charts but there's one in Pas Washington Washington um I would suggest just for the points you just made you should have at least one map with that on it terms over 90% of the entire State Storage is in that 6 make of that um yeah that's a good point uh the a the are it's as you can imagine with a tank capacity uh the tanks are Never full um by law uh they can't be full there have to be some you know buffer zone in there for safety Mar also as soon as you start using slowers down so these are sort average numbers um but nevertheless here we go you can see sort of where organs fuel is located okay uh we have a little more specific uh because you recall the 1567 directed is more around public facilities um and so this is a zoomed in map well it kind of gets down to the the Metro Reg we also recognize that despite the fact using regions no regions isolated is kind of reduction way to look at it so we show the other regions around the blue dots are government owned facilities um we have turquoise dots our government partner government partners are primarily um education institutions universities and school districts and um utilities as well electric utilities and natur G utilities also own fuel liquid fuels for their own purposes I learned yesterday should definely that northest natural in the Northwest warrant as a f know that they do so the like puds and Municipal which are governmental are they considered governmental Partners or government for this oh it's a good question um I don't know to be honest but if they have fuel uh and and we thank you for that um okay that's I think what we wanted to show you can see overwhelmingly government partners own um gasoline and Diesel and almost no Aviation by the way um I just wanted to bring attention to that aviation fuel uh really important for emergency planning emergency response um and just for point of coordinations we talked about that earlier uh we are in talks with Oregon Department of Aviation about state owned and aqu airports and their fuel capacity and storage capabilities um I think that was a point oh the two10 this is just as a note for explanation um we ex this two tanks are pgp facilities in Columbia County at uh their power P plant facilities it means beer power plant has um the ability for redundancy to use Liquid fuel anyway it was so much it kind of again the same idea that I sort of threw off the analysis but I just wanted to explain that to people so here you go lot of information um and then sort of more discussion points this map now shows uh the the risk the red is the higher level of risk for Cascadia abductions on earthquake um intensity and shaking and sort of where the capacity of our fuel infrastructure lies in relation to earthquak um and not surprising you know the intensity of the earthquake the most severe shaking and the most severe risk kind of goes towards you know middle of the L Valley up towards the footh hills um of the Cascades that's where the people live that's where fuel is we understand the risk we're trying to do a little more you know analysis on it but here you go um and you can see kind of the top line here um in the Portland metro region most Fel storage and this is even excluding the store this isn't even the risk with the terminals this is just because we live in an area that's at high risk to the um major earthquake like today right now um anyway I just want to make the point that",

        "text": " Oregon including the city of tiger the city of Portland which have established SDC waiver programs for adus um and these programs are intended to encourage the development of adus recognizing their contribution to affordable housing options and the benefits they provide in accommodating changing family Dynamics such as caring for aging parents or children with disabilities um and so in line with that I believe that the waiver of SDC for my proposed Adu would be in alignment with the shared Community Values within uh Washington County and the Board of Commissioners um and would have a positive outcome um for uh our community and given the financial burden associated with caring for family members with special needs the sdc's waivered would provide a significant relief and ensure that we're able to invest in a dwelling unit that will best serve both my mother's and Son's thank you for your time today thank you Holly next we have cole Peterson Cole can you hear us yes thank you my name is Cole Peterson I am a Adu uh subject matter expert based in Portland Oregon and uh I knew that Holly was going to be making this request today so I offered to um provide a little bit of kind of an academic municipal context for the STC waiver based on the Lessons Learned in Portland um so uh several jurisdictions have waved stcs for 8s including Portland Hillsboro Troutdale tiger Springfield and Wilsonville um also Gold Beach in Portland they wave the sdcs I I should be actually more clear on in Hillsboro they just do not have sdc's for it it's not a waiver um rather they just don't have them uh in Portland they chose two wave sdc's beginning in 2010 for ads as a means to incentivize their development and indeed it worked quite well um and in 2013 after a three-year abatement of the sdc's they waved them again for another three years 2016 the city council determined that it was working quite well they waved it yet again till 2018 in 2018 they decided to wave them indefinitely with the caveat that the Adu could not be or not no portion of the property could be used as a short-term rental because the city's council's goal was to increase the production of housing not Hotel units so that was a reasonable tradeoff that was um you know uh that that The Advocates I should say I should you know um Advocates were willing to concede upon in order to have this you know um a friendly policy toward the production of adus sdc's generally have a kind of a regressive um have a regressive impact on adus relative to the small impact infrastructural impact they have for the small household size they have a standardized uh fee structure in place so they have a disproportionately high cost relative to the impact and relative to the cost of construction so imagine you are doing a $125,000 garage conversion all of a sudden the play a you know 15% of that total construction cost um amount for that product uh housing unit development relative to say a new single family house where the cost of construction might be $600,000 and so a $155,000 SDC fee is a very small portion of that um and so the type of demographic that you're serving through an stdc waiver are generally speaking going to be um Mom and Pop you know small scale homeowner owners and um SDC waivers have proven to be a really effective strategy um in Oregon and also now in California you they wave sdc's for what are called impact residential impact fees for adus in Washington the entire state of Washington is is remove is eliminating sdc's or residential impact fees to the tune of 50% for adus indefinitely so this is definitely something that is proven to be an important policy metric or lever for city councils and state legislates to incentivize this affordable housing production form which not only is serving market-based affordable housing um opportunities but also providing these critical social needs that Holly alluded to in her personal story I'll stop there thank you so much for considering this all right thank you very much Mr Peterson would any other member viewing this meeting online via Zoom which should Prov public comment on any counter rated topic for up to 5 minutes give you one last chance to utilize raise hand function not seeing any additional hand sh hon thank you clerk moss and thank you to members of

        "text": "hi everybody uh my name is Edith Bayer Welcome to our webinar on um the Oregon energy strategy giving an overview and an update uh we see a lot of people still joining so we're just going to wait another minute and then we'll get thanks e hi good afternoon everyone I'm Janine Benner I'm the director of the Oregon Department of energy for those who I haven't met um thank you so much for attending this webinar about the Oregon energy strategy I'm going to uh just say a few words to open us up and then kick it over to my colleague Edith but basically the Oregon Department of energy has been tasked by the Oregon legislature to develop a Statewide energy strategy that identifies Pathways to achieve Oregon's energy and climate goals and to maintain affordable reliable energy and this strategy is aligned with our agency's mission to advanc solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition while protecting the environment and public health and responsibly balancing energy needs and impacts for current and future Generations that's the mission statement that you can see here on this slide with so many oregonians experiencing Rising energy costs often driven by needing to make our energy infrastructure more resilient to things like increasing climat driven disasters wildfires ice storms and deadly heatwise heat waves uh the timing of this energy strategy could not be more critical it's exciting to be here today to begin talking about some of the details of how this energy strategy work will progress and also how all of you can help inform the strategy so now I'd like to hand it over to our clean energy team leader and energy strategy Project Lead Edith bear thanks Janine um hi everybody I'm Edith Bayer it's really great to be here and I just wanted to talk talk about a couple of housekeeping items before we start first I just wanted to remind everybody that this meeting will be recorded um and the presentation will be available on the website for the energy strategy shortly after that we'd like to ask you to enter your name and ail affiliation in the Q&amp;A if you don't mind so we can keep track of of everybody who's here today um and I also want to explain that we'll be doing some live polling during this webinar we'll be using an app called slido um which you should could see on the right side of your screen um it could be kind of on the right or at the bottom it's a green s um and well when we get to a polling question which we'll do soon you'll see it pop up there um and that's where you'll answer it and if you don't see it you may just need to refresh the app just so just click on it and don't forget to click submit so that we can see the answer to your question um so I also um wanted to I wanted to pass um the mic over for a moment to my colleague Jessica right ERS who is um the manager for the policy and Innovation team here at Odo who's going to be um managing the questions and answers and we'll talk a little bit about how we're going to run that as well Jessica on to you thanks Edith I appreciate it um Des rakers uh as Edith man mentioned I manag the policy team and I'm already seeing some people filling out the Q&amp;A with their name and affiliation thank you very much for doing that I will also be monitoring that same Q&amp;A for questions throughout the um uh throughout the webinar if you don't know how to find your Q&amp;A if you look at the bottom right hand side of your screen you'll see a circle with a question mark inside of a rectangle if you click on that your Q&amp;A will pop up um you can even tell that popup to split out into a completely separate window if that's helpful to you uh the there are going to be two types of questions I'll be monitoring for one is clarifying questions that maybe something that Edith described um wasn't you didn't quite understand or it needs a little bit more context those um I'll try and break in and ask those questions as they uh come up the others I will be uh keeping an eye on and when we get to some natural breaks in 's presentation then I will be reflecting those back to her so um and uh also if you throw a question for me to me in the Q&amp;A about anything in particular are be happy to answer that also we may have some people responding just through the Q&amp;A if it's a really highly specific question but in general we'll be throwing most of these over to Edith for her to answer thank you thanks Jessica um so here's the agenda for our conversation today we're going to start with an overview of Oregon's energy landscape and a description of what the energy strategy is and and why we need one in the first place uh we'll then talk about how we're approaching the technical analysis and finally we'd like to provide some details on ways that folks can get involved in the process um and we'll leave about 30 minutes for questions and answers at the end which I think Jessica already mentioned um so again please type in um questions as we go we'll be tracking these questions um and we're looking forward to hearing from you towards the end um when we get to the Q&amp;A so uh I'm going to start with a couple of polling questions so this is the first test of um whether you can find slido on your screen um so the first question is did you attend the energy strategy launch webinar in November 20123 yes no or maybe you weren't aware of that meeting in which case there's a recording on our website you could check out and I'm going to give a minute for answers to come in my slido just popped up so maybe that was the timing for you and this is this is turning out to be a really useful question because a number I can see that a number of people were did not um connect to that webinar and that's totally fine and um we're going to give a lot of the background that we gave there today just to bring everybody on the same page um and then we'll go further and start to talk in a bit more detail about how we're going about um getting started with the work so um thanks for answering that question so the next question is um what are you most interested in learning today so we're talking about a few things what is the energy strategy how will the energy modeling inform the energy strategy and policy recommendations and what are the opportunities to contribute to developing the energy strategy um you might think all of the above but we're looking for whether there's kind of a primary um primary purpose for you today and what you'd like to learn and I'm just going to give a little bit more time for folks to answer this question because this is really helpful for us to see I should add that the full answer to the question of what is the energy strategy will be answered by November 1st of next year but today we'll talk about what the idea is for developing it all right um I'm just going to give it another minute so that people have a chance to to respond and so while you're responding I'm just going to move on but Abby maybe keep it open for a little bit so we can catch any um replies that are still coming in if that's okay um okay so thanks for that and I really want to start kind of uh by stepping back for a moment to look at the big and complicated picture that is our Energy System so this is a sanki diagram for from our um banial Energy report this will be updated um November of this year in fact and it's kind of a noly flowchart that shows you where our energy comes from um and and breaks it down by um what's producing that energy and how how we use it and there are a few points that I want to make here first um we uh produce some of the energy that we use in state but most of it is actually imported and that's part of the picture that we need to keep in mind when we talk about developing an energy strategy so on the far left of this slide you can see energy produced so that's energy that that we produce in Oregon you can see imported electricity and then you can see other energy that's not electricity like natural gas and petrolum that's um imported from outside of the state and then you can see um that U here we use kind of generic energy on the far left and then the next set of bars talks about what kind of energy that is so energy is produced by um Hydro power wind um further down you can see biomass coal natural gas petroleum and then if you go even further to the right you can see that a lot of that is converted into electricity and then finally you can see kind of the breakdown of how that energy is used it's used in in homes it's used in businesses in Industries um and in transportation and so um I think that you know two takeaways from this complicated slide I don't expect anybody who hasn't seen this before to absorb it fully but first we use energy from a lot of different sources for a lot of different purposes that's our starting point for our energy strategy and secondly some of that energy is produced in Oregon and a lot of it is also imported and this is the landscape that we're starting with so um in this slide it's a little easier to see where our energy comes from so you can see in this pie chart that um petroleum natural gas and hydro are the three biggest sources that we have we also use quite a bit of coal quite a bit of biomass wind and there are other resources in there too and on the right you can see where's that energy going about 29% of it goes to Transportation uh cars and trucks um and other Transportation about a quarter of it goes to homes little more than a quarter Powers industrial processes and about 19% uh goes to businesses so this is kind of where we use energy if we think of our um whole state split up into these four sectors uh so here's another view but now I'd like to zoom just into the electricity sector um so electricity isn't all the energy as you remember from the first slide but it's a really big part of the energy that we use and you can see here that um Hydro power accounts for the biggest share of um Oregon's electricity production there's also a big share of wind of coal and natural gas and coal and natural gas are",

        "text": " the financial assistance must be the only occupant of a residential dwelling in Oregon where the heat pump will be installed a requirement from the bill which is reflected in the rules for the eligible entities to prioritize the financial assistance to the groups on the slide the rules outline the method for determining whether an individual would qualify as being considered within an environmental justice Community but the rules also leave room for an entity to propose an alternative method attestations by the individual benefiting from the financial assistance will be used to identify whether the individual qualifies to be prioritized uh an applicant will need to specify how they prioritize these groups in their um I just saw a question in the chat about uh when the rules will be um and you send information and um we'll get on to the timeline and just uh towards the end of the uh presentation in a few slides time so as I mentioned there may still be tweaks to the program as we finalize um the rules um the rules are expected to be finalized next month um so here we go um February uh 2023 once the rules are finalized we expect to be able to provide more updates on the program um then we'll be able to publish uh the opportunity announcement this the opportunity announcement will outline who is eligible uh who's already kind of covered in the rules but with this kind of uh the opportunity announcement will kind of describe it again uh it also require explain the minimum required information um that's required in an application as well as outlining the scoring criteria that will be used in the competitive uh the Draft rules also details some of the information that will be required in the application um so if you uh Curious you can go in and kind of look for areas where we kind of detail some of the required information in the application um the opportunity announcement will be open for a short window of around four to six weeks the exact timing will be released in the opportunity announcement applications will be accepted online following the close of the application period the Oregon Department of energy will ensure the applications are eligible and complete and conduct a competitive review of the applications based on the competitive review results one of the application one application for each region and one application for each federally recognized Indian tribe in Oregon maybe offered a performance I will just get through the the last couple of sights and then start answering a couple of questions in the chat as well um the performance agreement will provide details of the requirements of the grantee and the terms and conditions of the grant requirements around record keeping reporting and compliance monitoring are detailed in the rules and they'll they'll be built into the performance agreement this includes retention of Records by the grantee submission of an annual report and cooperation in any inspections or other monitoring actions taken by Odo the grantee will also be required to conduct and keep records of their own inspections of heat pump installations if partnering the grantee must require by contract and monitor the partners compliance with the program requirements so thank you for joining today I hope this provides a lot more information about the program uh you can see there's uh there are potential for an applicant to Fashion a program from what is outlined in the rules uh to customize the program within the limit set in the rules um visuals there'll be some again uh we're just reviewing the public comments um and we will be publishing finalized rules uh next month there may be some tweaks from what was published in the Draft rules this will continue to provide updates on the program as the rules are finalized and when the opportunity announcement is published so I'd encourage if you're not already signed up to the email announcement to uh sign up for that and I can start and cover some of the um in the chat yeah James I think uh point you to those I also wanted to remind people on the phone that if they wanted to raise their hand they can press star 3 and we'll unmute them um but yeah there are a couple in the chat uh there James already um I just wanted to cover one piece on efficiency requirements as well uh that was one piece we're also kind of reviewing in the finalized review uh making sure our higher higher efficiency values are consistent with other existing programs as well as uh kind of reviewing the recently released um guns around the federal tax credits just wanted to highlight that and then I can start working through the chat thanks Angela so the uh I'll take John uh your question about the upper limit uh to the amount of uh money and the uh rebates are per dwelling so there's a kind of it's getting maxed cap at an amount per dwelling um and up to 100 uh up to 100 of the the cost of the installation and then there's also again the addition um first for the heat pump installation but then you can also get the additional uh price the cost of the upgrade as well up to um the max cap for the upgrade so it'll be the match cap for the heat pump installation per dwelling and the Mach cap for the the upgrade um per dwelling and they can be stacked on top of each other um and these uh rebates will be um but again this is kind of customizable for the region we're setting the Max and then within a regional entity will be able to apply and propose how they want to they'll run it in in their region as well so we're trying to provide the framework to allow um Regional entities to to customize it for their region so can there be more than one successful application per region um so we'll be a winning contract for one Regional entity per region that that resiliency can partner with um other eligible entities but they would be the lead uh and to the performance agreement is sang with through uh with the our own Department of energy an alternative boundary were proposed and accepted then um that could be an area where there is a redefining of the the program uh the boundaries of the region but um there would only be one entity kind of a performance of one entity for a region and then they could partner but they would have to outline their Partners in the the application process hey James we got a several questions coming in so I'm going to help um keep track of them here um for this next one would it be possible for Odo to provide the funding allotment for each eligible region rather than the formula um so yes the funding thank you on uh the funding allocation will allotment will be presented in the opportunity um we would just um required to have the um criteria outlined in the rules and uh we'll be able to present the funding um allotment for each region uh in the opportunity announcement okay great and then are people able to view the PowerPoint slides online or um I believe they will be able to uh see the size in a couple of days and they'll be published on the Odo website okay great um and then should the minimum on ductless systems be set at 8.0 or 8.5 to take advantage of BPA and local utility incentives on every project uh lowers project average cost and may allow entities to serve a few more households so I can just quickly start and then ask Stephanie just to take over so the Baseline the minimum uh Baseline efficiency standards um we are matching with the uh Federal uh standards uh for 2023 um and that's kind of a requirement that stems from the bill uh that we at least um or exceed those minimum uh standards certainly do you want to add anything to yeah we we are setting two minimum efficient levels um one is minimum matching the federal guidelines as James um which we feel allows for a broader range of heat pumps to be installed and then our higher efficiency minimum which would be eligible for a higher level of incentive is going to be in line with some of those other programs um as Jay mentioned James mentioned we're working on coordinating and making sure that's in alignment with BPA programs existing Energy Trust incentive programs and then the coming federal tax credits I'm trying to help ensure that if you're complying with that higher efficiency standard that then you'd be able to easily stack incentives from various programs okay thanks Stephanie so then we have here a question about so the funding can pass through a non-profit organization that serves Native Americans in Oregon and go to one of their Native American clients that provide climate Construction Services does that sound right non-profits are eligible and cease and as long as they serve uh environmental justice Community including tribal communities and then they would um they could propose to partner with other eligible entities and how they provide that um the actual installation as well as it would be kind of open for them to to propose whether it would be like an just kind of people come to request apply for rebates or grants or whether there's kind of some other structure that they would have clipping applications and then getting installs I think is that um so the question somebody else has any thoughts on that as well okay uh and then the next question is um is the population evenly distributed between the regions um so no the uh these are the regions and there's the 11 different regions population isn't going to be um distributed evenly but uh We've attempted to account for the differences the heating and cooling uh in the state as well as the differences in population in the allocation of the funding for each region okay and then there's another Regional um about does a regional administrator have to represent the entire region in which they're in um or electric utility cover half of a county would they need to do the administration for the entire region we would be then eligibility can kind of partner to cover the entire region um and there's also a requirement that if they serve a just a smaller area of the region are required to kind of um to cover the whole region a requirement in the bill I believe okay yeah that answers that question um and next question here is is there a way that Odo could gauge interest in applying from each region and let everyone know seems like it would save us all a lot of time and work Odo and us to work together on one application per so we've um been hearing a few comments around how we can help collaboration within a uh a region and so we're considering ways we can in the application process and or at least in um people working together so if you make sure to stay stand up if we are able to kind of provide anything like that uh we'll be sure to let people know okay and then the next question is from a homeowner who is below 80 of the mean income",

        "text": " so it's impacting energy prices and that sort of thing so and and i'm sorry just to clarify i should have said wind and solar yes yeah okay all right that's right thank and so here i'll give you another kind of uh slice of what this is really really showing us um so this is you know solar power again california comes up in the middle of the day obviously right sun comes up sun goes down and so we're really talking about here is what everything else is doing right so you can really see it here the natural gas plants the imports in this case probably a lot of that's imports from the northwest uh and they're hydro in california it's all sinking in the middle of the day as that solar comes on right so let's go through a little bit of how this all now kind of ties together with how do utilities now take all this information and how does this actually look you know at a course level how does this look when they actually are dispatching power plants so here i'll bring back bring back this curve and we'll isolate just the orange one just a typical summer day and i have my hypothetical utility portfolio here in the gray box all right so they have a few hydro plants they have a nuclear plant a couple wind turbines a couple natural gas facilities and some solar power right so a diverse mix of resources let's take a look at how this might actually look um so again this is the orange demand curve so this is demand throughout the day from the hypothetical utility right so they'll have the nuclear power plant probably run flat 24 7. right that's uh operationally it's hard to have those units go up and down very much so they tend to run flat maybe they'll have some hydro projects doing the same as some wind comes on overnight again free uh you know to dispatch onto the system so you're gonna take what's there again solar same thing you're gonna have solar and then essentially you have to fill the gaps and here i have that represented through some natural gas and obviously this is a of course uh clip art version of this but this is the sort of thing that's happening in real time all the time by utilities it's happening in each one of these each one of these bubbles you see here so this these are balancing authorities kaiso uh to our south that's the teal the big to one that covers mostly you see in the northwest at bpat that's bonneville's transmission system uh pac west pacificor has got a a region western oregon and then also you see pac east out in the utah wyoming area you see pge on there vista puget sound you'll probably recognize some of the each of these bubbles is a balancing it's just a term of art really in the industry for the entity that manages the transmission and balances load and resources across their footprint so this kind of balancing and dispatching of resources is happening in each one of these bubbles right across the region and just a note you know obviously i i you know touched on some of the solar variability uh there's also quite a bit of variability from other resources and this one really comes back uh and i'm about to flip over into sort of the resource build in the region and where it's headed um hydropower is quite variable right i think we all kind of know this intuitively based on you know rain conditions some years are wetter and drier this is actual data each one of these blue lines is looking at 80 the last 80 years in the northwest this is actual hydropower output based on obviously uh rainfall levels drives this significantly so you can see uh really wide variation right um you know you can be down close to ten thousand megawatts of of energy output in a dry year all the way up to uh well above 20 000 in a wet year so that's an enormous swing uh something to note here is that you know you could probably debate whether this is the way the best way to do it but the region is sort of long had a had for resource planning purposes they look at that red line they look at the what they call critical water which are that you know what what's what should we expect in a dry year and that's sort of what we use for resource planning purposes right so that's sort of uh we essentially in 95 of years uh you know you you can pretty much take it to the bank that that that amount of water will be there but you can see based on these blue lines in most years we're gonna have quite a bit of surplus um and that will show up as i start to look at what's what's happening in the state in the region in terms of imports and exports and how power is flowing around the region but this is the big reason for that um i won't dwell on this one but just as you know here's a map of the transmission system across the west not surprising this is all a huge interconnected system you know we are but one state but we're really uh part of a much larger machine and these flows uh they don't really much follow us they follow physics so they go where they go often um but there's a view there of what that looks like uh so where is our resource build today in the northwest and then i'll give a few visuals of sort of what the analysis is showing for where we're headed so here's what the current resource mix looks like right we're probably not surprised hydro is the largest resource although uh of course how many hydro projects likely come before essec but uh they've been around for quite a while and they're still the bulk of our resource right and you see natural gas and wind kind of come up a little bit of coal nuclear and then you can just start to see solar is really just barely starting to register uh and this one might be of interest uh uh to this group in particular i came across this recently uh from a group in the northwest that put together data looking at when uh power generators were built across the region over the last so it's a pretty interesting uh pretty interesting visual here uh again sort of intuitively you might know this but i was surprised to see just how much it was really nothing but hydro essentially before 1970 right it's really jumps off uh the visual there at uh the vote out of coal was really in the 70s and 80s you can see that in the brown bars there a good mix of natural gas and wind then through the 90s and into the 2010s so i think i'm sure some of you are familiar with some of this i see another hand up cindy um thank you actually when you're finished with this slide i just want to go back to the the previous slide oh i have a question about that no problem so let me uh so obviously it's getting a little more a little more dynamic now we're seeing a lot of uh a mix of resources solar wind batteries um it's more dynamic now and of course um this is sort of a new one right large scale retirements uh for really the first time um and that's uh increasing which i can which i'll show on another visual here but let me let me jump back here real thank you so this is cindy it's my question is so we've got name plate capacity for instance for a hydro of about 35 000 versus energy generating capability can you kind of explain those sure yeah i did i jumped over that um so what this is really saying is um and this kind of gets back to that the the previous slide i showed on the hydro variability right um there's there's a quite a big difference in terms of average energy output over a year from the hydro system compared to its nameplate capacity of what it could right uh and it's really based on its energy constrained based on the water flowing through the system right so you rarely get uh the full max output of the hydropower system at any given hour because you're limited by the water flowing through it um but you know during really wet years in the spring especially you will push up and uh you have quite a lot of power uh ripping through the hydro system uh but then when you average it out over the year it ends up you know i'm not sure exactly where that comes in it looks like it's just under 50 percent of its of its uh total capacity in terms of average energy output so it's that variability that um leads to the dramatic difference in hydro wind and solar it looks like yeah you see that's right yeah so and they're they're so what's interesting is sorry hydro is is quite variable but it's been the bedrock of our system and we've designed our entire power system around it right so now we're lingering into that and it was based around as i showed on that that kind of the red line of the low water years we sort of have been very conservative about saying we kind of for planning purposes try to erase that variability right because we say we basically use as an input that low water condition um and then when we have that variability it's all on the upside which drives a lot of exports right because in a lot of conditions uh we have surplus hydro and we've been a long been an exporter of electricity because of that and then in drought like a drought period like we're in there's might be some expectation that the energy generating capability just gets lower lower and lower on the hydro well it's interesting um so it's it's a it's a big system right so it's uh well we have a drought here maybe in the western part of oregon uh what really drives a lot of this has to do with the canadian rockies and the snowpack in montana and uh pretty far inland so you really have to look and you know certainly keep an eye on it and bonneville does and there's forecasts so even though we've been in this drought the last few years we've been hovering around average um so if you look at that you know the 80 water years they showed all those blue lines it's been around average uh you know the last really uh really low year was around the 2000 2001 energy happened to be an extremely low water so yeah it's sort of because our basin is so large it's sort of it's hard to uh necessarily extrapolate the drought conditions you have locally in one place to the overall basin but i think i saw another hand so i think it was perry yeah um",

        "text": " basically saying, hey, all right, county commissioners, we did our due diligence, we looked at this. Ball's in your court almost, right. But we need to bring the city of Ocala to the table and really work with them and their team and their attorneys in order to move this thing all the way forward. And I know from Pete's comments that they have a problem with some of the types. And so I just think all of that data in the next two weeks, to the best of our ability, needs to come back to us certainly within the next 30 days. Commissioner Stone. So we all have our perception, right? Well, and that's why I was asking you the question, and I'm sorry to throw us down this, but I think we all. We still have five minutes before our public hearing. Okay. So what my thoughts, too, were that the attorneys were to go back and go through making that minor adjustment. It was with the mobile homes in the mobile home parks and the mobile homes as mine properties. Exactly. To be part of a single family and then to include a section of town homes and condos. But also Benesh was going to have to crunch the numbers of what was the student generation rate for the townhomes and the condos. And then the attorneys would take a look at that part of the ordinance, and they may have. It was already in one of their. It just wasn't included in our. Also was really interesting, because in their charts, in the data and the booklet we had, they had broken out mobile home versus mobile home on a lot. Right. And they had condos and townhomes. And, I mean, those generation charts are in, you know, the huge package of information we had, and so they have it. And I think when guy, and especially from the city of Ocala concerns, when they come back, they can take those charts and expand if it. I mean, who cares how many categories it needs to go to if it's three, four, five, I mean, whatever it is. But I thought that the comment was made in the meeting that you couldn't really have an excessive amount of categories. I thought that there was. There's nothing in the state statute that says that. Let me make an observation. I'll use our MSVU process as an analogy. The law doesn't require absolute scientific certainty on these things, and there are some basic issues that we have to demonstrate. What was referred to as the dual rational nexus test. You know, so we have to demonstrate that there's a need. I think the study shows that there's a need, and then you have to be able to show there's a rational relationship between the numbers you come up with to satisfy that need. But it. We're not looking for scientific certainty. You know, we're not launching a spacecraft here. So there's a lot of variations that could satisfy the legal standard here. So can you answer Commissioner Bryant's question, though? In regards to can you only have three types or can you have five types or six types? You could potentially have a number. Yeah. Different types. There's no constitutional or legal requirement to only have three types. Well, and that's where I say we've got the study. All of that work has been done, and I don't think that the school board has put it on us. I understood when we left that meeting that the two attorneys, along with the city, city staff, city attorney, were all going to work together to work on the interlocal agreement that's needed with the municipalities and the county, and then for the final drafting of the ordinance. That was my understanding with the inclusion of the townhomes and the condos. And I think that was to your point, Commissioner Zalick, that you wanted to see what was the impact. And so I guess there's still the question mark. What is going to be the value of an impact fee for the Stearns Miller team offered us the ability for their, their team to go back and look at square foot. And I just wanted to see what the data brought back. So I think if we had guy ask them, hey, bring it back, then we could at least look at it. It certainly doesn't hurt us if we totally disagree with it. We just go with 40% if we like. Oh man, that really makes a lot of sense. Awesome. So as a comparison you want. I thought so. If you guys are okay with that. Yeah, you did ask that. So too. I don't know how that money's the water. So for them, they've got two weeks. I don't know. And quite frankly, I don't know. I mean, I think that it was actually stated in that meeting that they were finding that the larger homes had. They were. Your retirees were building them, they're 55 plus communities. And that the smaller homes were actually generating more of the impact. Right. And that's why I just don't think. But it's, you know, I mean, I get why, you know, the building community, why, you know, from a workforce housing perspective, you would at least want to look at it. That's all I was trying to do, honestly. And I didn't hurt. It's not our team. Their team was willing to go do the research and look at it, if I understood right guy. I mean, that was my understanding. So. Just didn't think it hurt us as they work on theirs, to have a ask them if they were willing to put their manpower behind it because it meant something to them. Awesome. Bring us back the data. We can make a better decision. But is that going to require us to have to have another workshop to discuss that? Because I think they could just bring it back to a board meeting. I was going to say we can't discuss it outside of either a workshop or one of our next board meetings in two weeks. We can ask September. Actually, we've got a fifth week in there. So. Like September 6? Yeah. I mean, when are you supposed to be back with your ordinance? There's no time frame on that now. You've said we're going to have an outside attorney working on the ordinance. Well, no, I just said for the school board to have somebody look at it because there seemed to be some confusion on their attorney's part. If you're comfortable with it, mister Minter. I mean, we've never had any issues, but they were very focused. Everyone was so focused Friday on, well, if we do this, there's going to be a, you know, we have to make sure there's no challenge. Challenge. I don't know how many times I heard the word challenge, and that's true. You don't. You don't want to go through this whole process and have a legal challenge, and then it's just in limbo while you're going through an appellate court for suggesting that. And it was, again, mostly for the school board because there seemed to be some confusion on their part when we were at that meeting. I need to move in. We've never had any issues. If you're clear as much. Yeah, we're as clear as. Well, I mean, no, we're clear because we specifically said the two attorneys are the ones that the balls in their court. And then the city of Ocala needed to have their information evaluated. That's where it is. I mean, there's nobody on the table. I was in touch with the school board attorney yesterday. I think I need to talk to Mister Sexton, the city of Ocala attorney, find out where they're at on this thing. And you know, just let me move forward with it and as quick as we can, I'll put something on the agenda for you. Okay, good. All right, let's go ahead and move into the public hearing, which is scheduled for 10:00. Proof of publication. Yes, sir, I have a proof of publication of legal Ad 91 00 11,975 entitled a notice of public hearing published in Star Banner newspaper on August 4, 2023. Morning. Good morning, commissioner. This is the first public hearing to consider an ordinance to allow dogs in outdoor seating areas of restaurants. The state Division of Hotels and Restaurants regulations currently prohibit animals in restaurants generally. However, state law authorizes the local government to amend its land development code to create a permit process to allow restaurants to allow dogs in outdoor areas subject to certain rules. The ordinance before you largely tracks the requirements of the statute and is modeled closely on ordinances adopted by other local governments who've chosen to permit this activity in the past. The Land Development Regulation Commission has found this ordinance consistent with the comprehensive plan and has recommended approval. I'm happy to answer any questions the board may have about the ordinance or its authorizing statute. Any questions? I mean, the dogs are going to be on leashes, right? And not allowed to sit in the owner's lab. They can't be fed from a dish from the restaurant. And we're following the rules that the state laid out for the process. Is there anything in. Only outdoors, right? It's only outdoors. And the dogs cannot pass through an indoor area to get to the outdoor area. It has to be an outdoor path all the way to the designated area. Is there any rules regarding what type of leash they should be on? Because I know that, I got a phone call about that, and I'm sure some of you might know, I do not believe that the. That the ordinance particularly deals with leashes, because the. Because the statute didn't require anything about particular leashes. It just said that they. That patrons must keep their dogs on a leash at all times and keep the dogs under reasonable and direct control. There isn't anything particular about a",

        "text": " and so it wasn't a study of storage by any means it wasn't you know meant to say this is all that storage can do but in this particular scenario in the way that we set up storage it did reduce curtailment by about 15 even without any transmission upgrades um but we're still at levels that are pretty unreasonable for for the investment of all that uh generation so we would still need to see transmission upgrades to make those worthwhile um so that's what's meant by the furthest the next two bars um the brown and darker red are near zero um across the board so you can see in claptop there actually are zero and then in toledo it's less than about five percent so that shows that in the transmission upgrade scenarios we avoided most of the curtailment there um okay next slide should be the last one i think finding seven um right so this is showing how offshore when we inject more offshore wind we also see higher imports from oregon to california and that these happen to coincide nicely with their peak net load in the evening so i hope i'm sure people are familiar with these duck charts so um we see that after wind does help alleviate the duck curve by providing energy in the in the um early evening time and then as as we see higher injection of offshore when we see more exports along that line so this will feed it nicely to future studies that look at oregon and california offshore wind it'll be interesting to see how those fields change when we actually have maybe more offshore wind in california so expect that to change but suffice it to say that there is value for california and further fields in offshore wind on in on the oregon coast as long as we can get it along those coastal lines so i think i think that's it one more slide might have just a summary on it oh just references so that's all i have looking forward to the questions i see there's already a bunch in the chat not sure how you want to handle that yeah marty um i have been going through the chat a little bit just so that we can surface some of it in discussion as um and for those on the phone so i'll just do that quickly and give you a chance to sort of weigh in on some of these questions okay um i think you answered the contingency analysis one um already from julie but sean also had a similar question for you as before for pcm studies runs versus reliability using wac ads cases and then there is also a question about please explaining more about the change in assumptions made the transmission system itself were the ratings of the transmission lines increased uh if so could you help under help the understanding of the new ratings used as well as any reliability considerations i think you covered a little bit of that before um but if you wanted to emphasize anything there specifically and then kathy asked if um this analysis was redone using only the three bone claw areas sure um why don't i start from the bend so the three bone collar is actually this was done before those three are identified so we use five call areas so kind of distributed evenly from north to south along the coast um and each was mapped to a single substation so those were the names that i had on on that finding three slide and those call areas in turn came from a previous study from nrel that looked at just the cost of oregon how much you know and actually patrick could talk better to that but that was more of the studying the lcoe projections and then also seeing maybe what the full technical potential could be along the coast those calling errors weren't represent were meant to represent the ones that exist now but they at least the southern sides have have similar uh characteristics so the purposes of those colors were really just for us to pull resource data so we could get realistic power profiles but they weren't meant to be you know the send stone this is where the sites will be so of course a lot of the analysis does depend on timing of the wind speeds in each particular area and then the combination of how much capacity we're putting in each location um but they were they mapped relatively closely to the existing collars now they just we started this before they were set in stone so okay so the transmission system uh we increased the ratings and transmissions lines so we started out before upgrading those lines by having a pretty in-depth discussion with um bpa so it's authority in in the area to make sure that we had all of the metrics correct so we we changed our existing assumptions a little bit by increased by introducing summer versus winter ratings so summer summer thermal limits are generally lower because there's heating and line sag so there's there's less power that can be but and then also reactants and resistance but we didn't change those and those generally less impactful on the model so it really was just the thermal limits that we're interested in and not stability limits because stability we can generally kind of use a hand wavy assumption assume that well you can put whatever active power support to to support stability but really it's the thermal limits of the lines how much can how much current can flow in these lines without them literally burning up so that's um that's what we increased in order to reduce curtailment there and then similar question pcm studies reliability right so we um we didn't study reliability in in the full sense of the word no that would require a different model or a lot more runs where we where we force the lines to be out and see what happens but we uh we didn't do that in this case um and then surfacing a comment from sean that california interest in being an off taker still would likely face a bottleneck at the inter ties given that they're fully subscribed and then amanda had a clarifying question on um if this curtailment under the circumstance if the curtailment is under the circumstance that all 2.6 gigawatts goes into a single connection point oh sorry is that i'm not looking for that question uh oh is the curtain under no so there in all of the scenarios uh and if you go back to slide or the finding one uh jason that should help help me answer this so we we distributed the capacity uh oh the next yeah just one one more to the right uh the one with the map on it oh nice okay so right so we distributed as you see on this table here and um the kind of ocean locations are just meant to represent the centroid of those of those aliquots that we used to get the resource data not necessarily matching up with the actual call areas although the southerly sites definitely were more similar to the existing call areas but this is how we distribute it and then each is connected to one of those red boxes so um you can see in the parenthesis there which which site matches up with which substation and we just identified five along the coast that we thought five high voltage substations that were the closest geographically and would make the most sense as a time point and another piece is important that we didn't measure we didn't capture transmission to actually get the power to those substations so we all would just assume that it was generated right but no the 2.6 gigawatts is distributed as as you can see in this table and that's why the curtailment was broken out uh on the next slide uh so great i'm gonna go to harvey on the phone and then i'll come back to the chat as people put more questions and comments and uh go ahead harvey thank you uh just some ideas i you know they may not uh pan out but uh i think you need to do a cost-benefit study but if the submarine cable uh from your offshore tran uh generating site the technology for that uh if you got if far out uh i don't know if we got the technology to some for some reason electrical high voltage submarine cables uh it's also that like mentioned the chat before or landslides uh on the continental shelf or if it's close to that or some sloped area could be severed that might be a problem or the technology is not uh cause it's not there or it's not caught prohibit if you put it up too far uh when you're gonna need storage uh in some ways you could put a this is just a an idea uh you have uh some floating barges and you have a storage uh method such a idea suggested was hydrogen you you have a compressor you store the hydrogen in a in a pressure vessel you put the barge you disconnect the barge and then you take it to a brookings or coos bay and plug it into the transmission system it's kind of i don't know it may not work but and then uh did provide your peak power you got another one that's already a couple of two or three others uh accumulating power and you go this back and forth but that's a kind of a maintenance problem you know for using tugs crew the other alternative is a um it's been an experimental light i know i've seen this a bonneville that's been done at bottle was a super kentucky magnetic storage smees they call it smees they did that back in 1980s it was successful project uh it can store electricity and but yeah and it cleans the power you can get very clean power coming out of it when you go through your inverter did they the uh disadvantages of says maybe a low density and you've got a very strong powerful magnetic field uh you can't have any steel around it uh if you have for example the foundations of the site i saw the kind of the concrete foundations have a fiberglass rebar if you put steel rebar in there or the the magnetic field is so strong it'll pull the rebar out of the concrete but it's cryogenic it's a very a low temperature uh technology you have to uh i think that conducts super conducting con materials has improved since the 1980s so you might be a lower uh temperature a higher temperature superconductor material might work out but i would definitely do a a cost benefit study on that definitely find out whether you have the technology to uh transmission uh power through a submarine cable uh if you can't do it or it's not very cost prohibitive you're gonna have to look at storage and methods of storage and then maybe getting it sent to the shoreline if you do have uh technology",

        "text": " on this I don't know what other additional fees that we would be considering but it certainly does allow us to provide some or add some additional fees in there obviously negotiated so yeah I've read I've read everything else in the 06 agreement and I think I think there's a a lot of criteria in there I mean the program objectives and then you go to back to the part back where um they have to meet all this the review process and they have to go there pretty thorough I think so I'm I'm okay with this great thank you I'll I'll go through mine um so commissioner Rogers I heard your question on the third bullet on this slide as really trying to better um in rural areas for Rural sip so I I heard you're fine with with the themes as well and I know I'm I'm fine with these three themes uh with regard to an um and appreciating that as you said our next step will include your putting together staff proposals so uh the other thing that I don't quite have my head around is and would expect you to help us better understand uh for updates to the the provisioning of the program um the the sixth General the nine specific is the way these one through nine are operationalized making sure that they are relevant to our 21st century context where we are um for example you know clean water services and this is totally in the weeds uh Clean Water Services we don't get to we we can't increase the size of the Tualatin river right we got the tmdls we have so water reuse is huge so it doesn't just put the burden on clean water services but rather there's work to be done to really solve that and invest in the water reuse pipelines that are needed we have the science in terms of implementing water reuse um but uh we there's it all comes back to the infrastructure and the dollars so that's where my head is really going in terms of how do we practice the art of the possible with potential applications right so I'm trying to imagine what some of these might involve and think it through that way or the um for the job structure and support systems you know our current Workforce is different than it was 20 years ago and so how can how we operationalize that second one is different and I don't know if that will all be achieved through the workforce's board and our community college training programs or what have you needed so those are just a couple of areas on number six assist the county in land use transportation and neighborhood design objectives well this is where you know that heartburn or that huge significant impact I was talking about so these major Investments are major Investments and the ooh slide number I think that's a 17-18 slide 19. it's go back one more oh no not wages it's titled economic growth has a blue that one yeah so okay those are that's economic output by sector but we know there will be you talk about over 20 years 26 000 new jobs 2.8 billion in state net revenue so net revenue okay that's net income 2800 Millions so that 16 million dollar cap of gain share is just 0.57 percent of 2.8 billion not a lot increase in population will require us to increase our housing including potentially homeless affordable housing Health and Human Services portfolio the state legislature has hard impact for our Public Safety and justice system and we know there's impact there so for me that program objective needs a more holistic Washington County portfolio look and this may be where additional fees are required because we already know our current Public Safety Levy is not keeping Pace I mean we're going to have to do another replacement Levy right are what was it five cents wasn't enough uh increase with the last one similarly just with Library services in Washington County loves libraries you know libraries are key for um career growth for education for adults and our youth so maybe there's something I think hopefully I've been making my point or painting the picture enough so that's where I don't have enough hours in the day to get into the current program objectives with specific ideas myself I really need your help and expertise in terms of what we might consider as we move forward in our next steps for uh adopting a 2023 uh new sip policy I think what 06 has I was very pleased with house sound it's it's seems here all these years later thank you very much to you and your formal former colleagues and you answered both of my tickets and just for an example of how we've operationalized number two in the current agreements if you look at the little chart of current supergregates Beyond that's in the memo it's not in the PowerPoint um if you look at the community support line we do put into agreements that there have to be investment into Workforce and opportunities created by each of these companies to support programs at our discretion we place it Authority with the CEO's office for a certain number of years a hundred thousand dollars comes in the county tells them who to pay it to to support those Workforce so that's an example of how we can operationalize but we can also work on language to make that clearer and and have more specific outcomes expectations which helps us or Matt when he has to negotiate because these are complicated complex negotiations that has a team of experts who have signed non-disclosure agreements from all the parties that have to sign it because a lot goes into these agreements so when it comes to the negotiating team the clearer the objection or the objectives of this board are help guide those conversations for that that specific team of experts that come out of the county from the CEO's office from Matt from Tom's office um and uh finance and assessment and Taxation that's it's a pretty big table already so that negotiating team appreciates Clarity and so so if I could just finish the reality of the property tax measures of the 1990s as felt here in the 2020 symbol Beyond doesn't pay for the level level of community services that are required over the net these next 20 years I know I'm preaching to require in terms of that picture and that's why I'm trying to explore how those Community the employers would say well we don't need that directly but your Workforce does and you're investing here to be part of a thriving community and we have a track record of doing that so help us achieve those objectives in a balanced way I'm not putting it all on them not at all so I just want to explore that so uh yeah I just wanted to respond to what Catherine was saying if that's okay right yeah um you know it seems to me when I look at at what you're saying and when I read the Sip objectives there's there's kind of a missing piece here and that's what is our philosophy here and that's you know there's a it goes for me philosophy policy and then operationalizing the how we how we do our work and there's a couple pieces that are missing and one is what is our it's the relationship to the state and several times you've talked about that the the policy objectives are about the company that we are engaging with not necessarily how we engage through the state with it with companies I'm just suggesting that maybe we need to think a little bit about that like it comes it comes up in the game share conversation but it also comes up in some of these areas as well so I'm just I'm trying to think if there's a point where we can think about a philosophy statements and I'm not thinking about real in depth but more umbrella type statements does that make sense to you Catherine it's a possibility I think we'll know a little bit more in our next step and then we can go thumbs up thumbs down or sideways right my point we're moving in a good direction and yeah I've heard the chair share her indignation you can only oh thank you for joining me in indignation yes when you base a career on on being honorable and you sit there and say if somebody tells you something they're going to hold themselves to that standard the state certainly hasn't done it I mean it must be honest I've had governors in pleading with us to do these things and we did them they want to change the rules like years later so okay I'm beyond that nothing I can do people change but the important that I think is just a suggestion if I were somebody in the state legislature at this point somewhere less than five years of experience with almost all of them they don't know what happened and what is happening they just do that Steve we're getting rich on they in their minds they think we're getting rich they don't they don't realize what's happening we have never Quantified the expenditure time in all of us that we've talked about we've never Quantified we've Quantified look how rich it is for the state in terms of the income tax and it is it's kind of like if I'm out selling your product and I say well I get 10 of it I think I'm going to get 10 until you see that big I think you only should get two percent because I don't like the numbers you're getting you're just greedier that's all they just got greedier but we have to somehow quantify what our real costs are Catherine was mentioning in regard to clean water service which is a good one when you treat millions and millions and millions of additional gallons of water out of a Fab I mean it's expensive so you got roads you've got sewer you've got Police Services you've got a lot of things but we've never put a even an estimated cost on it and so if I were looking at it I say what are you guys whining about look at all the money we just stated giving you nothing we said that's not for nothing if you want to be our partner and pay for the roads and the sewers the Police Service says okay that's fine but that's why we even adopted the gain shift as we all know we were climbing back and saying we got costs you got no cost you just sit here and beg on the side tell us to give us money to do these projects of course they can give us some money back to be able to accomplish them so I don't know how you'd quantify that you can see that's an impossible task but I think that the good when you guys do it all the time some good fingers in the wind you know saying look at to do most programs it's going to cost this amount of dollars and that's what we should be targeting because I can't face I'm just one",

going to we're going to start by giving people a couple more minutes just to uh to trickle in and join us thanks so much for holding all right let's go ahead and get started thanks so much to everybody for joining us today again if you um if you're here for the first time this is our third of our um uh three third of three sessions that we've been holding thus far in the last couple weeks regarding the home energy rebate program today we are going to be discussing the home electrification and appliance rebate specifically and um my name is Emily salary if you haven't met me yet I am one of Oregon Department of Energy's federal grants officers working here to bring in some federal dollars to the state of Oregon again for a number of different um programs such as the one we'll be talking about today um next please all right so this slide just shows our agenda for the day um we will start out with an introduction to where the um hear funding comes from um a rough timeline of what we're looking at to get some of these rebates available to folks some of our related progr programs that we're working on at the Oregon Department of energy and a background um about justice 40 one of the initiatives that's included in this program I will say if this is your third time joining us um feel free to make yourself a cup of coffee um right now so you don't have to um I lost my screen can everybody still still see me and hear me yes we can oh I'm so sorry don't what happened all right um my apologies so I'll be going over that that background there um barring any other disconnects um and uh and like I said it'll be maybe 10 minutes or so and then um and then will will join me um to talk a little bit specifically about the here program he'll go into some details on what that program is going to entail and um open up some time for some Q&amp;A for you all to get some of your questions answered and then um and then Christy will join us as well to go through some questions that we have of all of you to get some more um answers on how we can help design design that program next slide please awesome thank you all right before we jump in just a quick introduction to the organ Department of energy or Odo as you might hear us referred to if this is your first time being familiar with us um on this slide you'll see our mission our vision and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see the services that we provide and how we achieve our mission and the funding opportunity that we're discussing today will help OD support a resilient and affordable Energy System as well as a clean energy transition next slide please okay and for those of you who are new to using WebEx the platform that we're on right now here's a quick guide on this screen on how you can use some of the features all of our attendees are off camera and muted but our host will unmute you if we call on you to ask a question you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under the participants panel if you click near your name there's also going to be an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar and feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments um please just make sure to send to all panelists or everyone so that all of the oo St staff can see it and help respond we'll also try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands but we may not have time for all of them today I also noticed that some people have called in on the phone um if you're on the phone you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when we call on you and the host will unmute you from our end and then I also just want to make a note that we are recording today's listening session and the recording will be posted on our website likely tomorrow or in the coming the next coming days next slide please all right so we'll start here with a little bit of background on the home Energy rebates and and where they came from so the US Congress passed a large Federal package known as the 2022 inflation reduction act or IRA that included a number of Grants tax incentives and rebates to help consumers lowerer their energy usage and save on energy bills the home Energy rebates are um actually going to be a pair of two separate but complimentary Grant programs that are available to Oregon from the US Department of energy Oregon must apply for these federal dollars through a Grant application process which includes laying out a plan for how to offer rebates to Residents within the state for Approved purposes and the applications could not begin until the US doe provided the requirements of the application and guidance and clarifications on any of the federal policies that are included the initial guidance was released at the end of July and many of the program policies were laid out in that Federal guidance while many are left to the individual states to determine so um pretty soon will is going to go over some of those specifics about the here program today if you missed us talking specifically about homes yesterday Stephanie went through a lot of the details of the Home Efficiency rebate program that um that recording is posted on our website as well as um the presentation that that we went through yesterday so you can rewatch that at your leisure and at some point we'll drop in the chat the link to the website um we'll talk about it pretty frequently today where you can find so much of this information um and uh and so jumping back into what I was talking about with these programs Oregon won't have the funds for these programs until the grant applications have been accepted and an award has been negotiated so the deadline for applying for these funds is Janu AR 31st 2025 and of course designing the programs is going to take careful planning but we understand that there's a lot of excitement and anticipation and we're working really hard to have an application submitted and therefore have the rebates available much sooner our goal right now is to have the rebates available as early as mid 2024 next please thank you another thing that I want to just mention really quickly is that rebates are not the same as tax credits and the IRA included um both and so there is some common misunderstanding around these two things the um the home Energy rebates are going to be administered at the state level and um the tax credits are administered by the IRS so unlike the home Energy rebates the energy efficient home improvement credit is available this tax year through the IRS um those rebates um that we're going to be offering next year are going to be a reimbursement or they'll provide a cost discount for eligible upgrades you'll see on the right hand side of the screen there um some details about those tax credits um and and there's some links in there as well hopefully we can drop some of those links in the chat for you guys um to to navigate I will mention that we are not tax professionals at Odo so we just encourage you to tax us talk with a licensed tax professional about this tax credit the other thing that I'll mention um recently um announced on um September 27th the IRS issued some uh expanded and updated guidance relating to home builders and the tax credits so this guidance extended enhan the energy efficient home credit and allows Builders who construct reconstruct and re rehabilitate energy efficient homes a tax credit of up to $5,000 per home and the volume of the home builder credit depends on the type of home and the home's Energy Efficiency so for example a multif family dwelling unit um contractors could receive the full $5,000 credit if the construction workers are paid a prevailing wage next please okay and on this slide here we'll talk a little bit about some of the different home energy programs that we're working on here at Odo and how all of those programs work together um so oo is preparing for the home Energy rebates by aligning our program goals and policies from several different complimentary programs so one of the ones that we're talking about today here and it's complimentary sister program homes is um are going to be those two Federal programs that can help you upgrade your home and appliances with energy saving Technologies and um those programs are going to be supported by uh Trek as you see there on the top which stands for um training for residential energy contractors and that is another Federal program that will help us bring funding into the state to support Workforce Development for the home Energy rebates we're in the process of applying for that program right now and we'll utilize funding to provide subg grants to existing programs in our state to educate and train new and existing workers such as electricians and plumbers to name a few on those energy efficient Technologies so this will help us to ensure that Oregon is prepared with a qualified Workforce to implement the upgrades and appliances in the rebate programs um another complimentary program this one is a state funded One-Stop shop as we call it here and um the legislature this last session recognized the need to streamline the approach to connect oregonians with the available funds for these energy related projects so with HB 3166 they passed um in the 2023 legislation the bill tasks oo with creating a single resource that oregonians can use to navigate the variety of incentives and rebates available to them the One Stop Shop is directed to provide information technical assistance and assistance in identifying contract factors and financing options related to energy efficiency incentives and programs and then um lastly other state funded programs that we have going on some of them are uh the heat pump programs you may have heard of so we've got two state funded heat pump programs one is the community heat pump deployment program which is implemented by Regional partners and is $10 million um that offers incentives to support heat pump installations for homeowners the second one is Oregon rent Ral heat rental home heat",

lastly it increased the repowering would increase the generating capacity per turbine amendment 6 also included a proposal to construct 50 megawatts of battery power request for amendment 7 much like request for amendment 6 is specific to the vancicle 2 geographic unit and therefore was submitted by fpl fpl energy band sickle fpl energy state line two uh and request for amendment seven the certificate holder uh in request for amendment seven seeks approval from to amend the approved turbine specifically the minimum above ground blade tip height and the hub height repowered wind turbines if repowered the proposed wind turbine specification would um the proposed wind turbine specification changes would result in a decrease in the minimum above ground blade tip height from what was approved in january which was 59 feet down to 50 feet and would increase in hub height 295 feet to 315 feet uh additionally request for amendment 7 included an amendment to condition 137 sub a and sub c that condition would need to be amended incorporate the proposed change to the turbine specifications and as i have noted here on the on the bottom of this slide the proposed changes to the above ground blade tip height and the hub height would not increase the blade tip height of the turbines at the this figure zoomed in figure uh representing the band cycle 2 unit on this figure the green triangles i know it's hard to see but the green triangles represent the wind turbines themselves and the dotted line that runs north west is the overhead transmission line and the attached black and white line represents the site boundary itself and if at any point council has any questions for me don't hesitate to ask this slide um is our procedural history and i apologize this is rfa 7 procedural history not rfa 6. didn't catch that sorry the department received the preliminary rfa for rfa7 on april 19th 2022 and following our review uh we deemed the amendment complete on may 12 2022 and we a complete request for amendment 7 also on may 12th on may 13th the department issued its dpo recommending that council approve rfa7 as well as we issued the determination that type b for this amendment request was justified additionally on that same day may 13th the department issued a notice of public comment period on the amendment request and on the dpo itself the comment period extended 24 days from may 13th through june 6th no comments on the dpo or on the rfa were received during that comment period and i think i will just go into well and we're there we're here today june 24 um for council's review of the proposed but i did want to describe the differences between the type a review amendment review and type b amendment review council rules describes the differences in review or type a and type b review paths the type a review is the standard or default amendment review process for changes that require an amendment one of the key procedural differences between the type a and type b review process is that type a review requires a public hearing on the dpo and provides an opportunity to request a contested case proceeding on the department's proposed order whereas a type b review does not there's no dpo hearing nor the opportunity to request a contested another difference between the type a and type b review process relates to the time afforded to the department in making its determination of completeness on the amendment and issuance of the dpo this next slide um is an overview of the proposed order and a summary of the changes made from the dpo to the proposed order as mentioned at the forefront of my the changes made in the proposed order administrative um there were updates made to the introduction section uh as well as section two of the proposed order which is the amendment process section and lastly uh administrative updates made to the scope of review of the request for amendment section which is section three the proposed order itself was provided to council as attachment one of the staff report for this agenda item so that's agenda item e and that was provided two weeks ago onto the next for this presentation to counsel and as i presented in the proposed order itself the department wants to note that although a full review of all applicable standards was conducted and and presented in the proposed order the department concluded that the changes proposed in rfa 7 would not result in impacts necessitating new or amended site certificate conditions and that to the extent applicable previously imposed conditions would continue to minimize potential impacts under the following applicable standards and requirements listed on this slide with that the department does not plan on discussing these standards any further during the presentation today however if council has specific questions about any of these standards the department would be glad to discuss then the following three slides provide the department's substantive changes um i'll go into that so this is moving into your review of the proposed order and the standards that the department uh have substantively evaluated in the proposed for the general standard of review the department recommended council amend condition 137 to remove the wind turbine dimension specificity and rather rely instead upon council's mandatory in division 25 the mandatory condition which is division 25 006 sub 3 sub a would or that this mandatory condition requires that the facility be designed and constructed substantially as described in the site certificate the existing site certificate condition condition 137 contains a summary of wind turbine dimensions based on the current condition and if repowered this recommended approach to remove specific dimensions from 137 would remove the automatic site amendment triggered by the existing condition and would would allow some flexibility in the if a change is minimal enough that impacts to resources protected by council standards would not on this screen i have the department's proposed strike through an amendment to the condition which removes the height requirements found in a and c well and b for the land use standard the department recommended in the proposed order that council find that umatilla county has not adopted any specific standards or code provisions that would apply to dimension changes proposed in rfa7 no amended or new conditions were the last standard that i'm going to be going over today the public health and safety standards for wind energy facilities for this standard the department recommends council find that there are adequate codes and engineering evaluations that apply to the evaluation of minimum above ground blade tip clearance and hub to ensure continuation of minimal health and safety impacts to the public from blade or tower if the turbines are repowered and that the change in minimum above ground blade tip clearance would not warrant any new or changes to devices or design layout with that unless there are additional questions or comments i will move into a council's decision on the proposed the department recommends council adopt the proposed order as the final order in grant issuance of an amended site so i'll leave it there for you chair grail thank you chase are there any questions or comments for chase adam chair this is henley chase in the proposed order that i have a copy of um it references a condition 137 and on page seven it just says there's and there's no preceding reference to condition 137. it just says 137 say that it's the condition 137. yes it's line 39. i guess i would just suggest that you add the word condition in there so that it's clear i think it's fairly clear because it is referenced later as the condition 137 very first reference doesn't call it a condition it just calls it by number so i might add that uh council member jenkins can you um indicate the page number sure it's on page 7 and it's line 39 of the proposed order that's what you have what's that does that match what you have um i don't have it up in front of me right now but i just uh in case so i assume that if somebody makes a motion they're gonna make a reference to that to make that change in the final order and so i just wanted to get that clear um for the uh the motion language any other questions comments sure i'll give it a try um madam chair this is hanley i'm moved that the council adopt the proposed order as final order and issue the seventh amended site certificate or the state line win project and include a addition of the word preceding um so it'd be on page seven line one third of line 39 it would read amended condition 137. thank you yeah madam chair this is kent and al another question comments mr secretary please call perry choctoot and buyer cindy condon hanley jenkins marcy graham yes kent howe yes jordan truett motion carries madam chair thank you mr thank you chase madam chair this is patrick rowe yes patrick councilmember buyer's vote on that action item was not audible for those of us that are participating remotely and so i suspect that means it's not going to be audible on the recording you may want to redo that make sure that her microphone is on thank you and just a reminder so there's always myself included there's always just a split second delay when you turn on the microphone and when you speak so you know i think it's just sort of give it just a pause for a second and then just lean into the microphone and then that way it'll ensure it catches so just for the voice vote on that so i'll recall that so and buyer for the record empire yes thank you you okay our next agenda item is a demo of mapping a reporting tool from wally adams odo operations and policy analyst he will present a demonstration of the oregon renewable energy siting assessment mapping and reporting tool good morning wally good morning council and chair grill just need a second here to get set up and to start sharing my screen when we're totally remote we don't have to have the time to physically switch okay thank you again um and good morning so about a year ago actually i did a presentation on the oregon renewable energy siting assessment project to council and i'll give you a brief refresher on the project but at the time we said that part of the project was to develop a mapping and reporting tool and that is now done and has been launched and that's really the purpose here today and we'll jump into that pretty quick and",

        "text": " and before I start uh I just want to acknowledge that we are well aware that this whole area the Columbia Gorge area and well beyond is uh part of the ancestral homeland of tribal Nations and we intend to conduct the development of this project uh with that very much in mind and to and we realize this is just the first step in hopefully building a authentic um with that next slide please fsec I think wants us to focus primarily on the uh where and the what of this project but uh we're also going to go through some of the aspects of the why of this project um and we're trying not to belabor that but I think it's important to understand the context uh next please the whole rationale for this project is uh started with the passage in both Oregon and Washington of legislation that mandates uh the transformation of energy to a decarbonized economy and the two states mandates are slightly different but uh basically uh the deadline for achieving 80 percent of the goals is the year 2030. which may sound like a long time away projects of this type take a long time to develop to permit and to build so we feel that we're starting at the right time and we've actually been examining and studying this project for two or three years at this point in order to meet that goal of 2030 which we'll talk to a little to talk about a little later with the schedule what's needed the situation is that renewable energy is primarily uh best cited east of the Cascades the resources are better uh there's availability for uh efficient solar and wind projects the people who use and will be basically required to use the renewable energy the clean energy are primarily located in the west of course so crossing the Cascade and getting the renewable energy from east to west is the key challenge here I think it's been increasingly acknowledged that new transmission of one kind or another from east to west seriously needed and particularly needed if you're going to reach the goal of 2030. next slide yeah next slide please there we go uh again this just reinforces my point that um according to Portland General it'll be impossible to meet the 2030 goal without new transmission and I think that's pretty generally acknowledged next slide please so try to sum it up there's no available or very little available transmission right now that hasn't already been kind of spoken for accounted for in the existing system uh there are stranded Renewables east of the Cascades either built or not quite built yet but hope hope to be built there's an increasing energy demand because of the drive toward electrification of cars of trucks of I think it's fair to say that everyone would acknowledge that building overhead transmission has its own set of so that's that's basically kind of the the setting there we go as you can see from the left hand what we're proposing is a bundle a bundled transmission cable primarily in the river of the 100 mile route about 83 miles is in the river about 17 total in three segments is buried underground uh so you know that is not a photoshopped photo this this is the and it's about six inches in diameter a two Cable Bundle along with a fiber optic cable as you can see on the right hand photo uh is fed out into the river from a barge or a ship and installed 10 to 15 feet below the existing sediment of the river this is a proven way to serve a lot of energy needs and 1100 megawatts which is what the proposed capacity of this line is will serve around 800 000 homes next place so this is a very high level view of the route and I think that SEC already showed this but it starts in The Dalles continues in the river to the Bonneville Dam Area bypasses the Bonneville Dam again totally Underground re-enters the river and heads over toward Portland where it comes ashore again uh about the midpoint of Hayden Island and finally connects to a converter station and we'll talk about converter stations in a second in the Portland Rivergate industrial area and then over to pge's harbors and to go to the next slide to give and I I guess I guess you've seen the route and The Dalles uh so as was stated the intention is to build a converter uh just adjacent to the existing big Eddie bpa's big Eddie uh substation to convert the AC power that is coming into Big Eddy to direct current or DC power why do that plenty of reasons and if people want to explore that we have people here who can explain that a lot better than I can but essentially DC is a very efficient way to transmit energy long distances and particularly underwater there are other advantages to DC that I don't need to go into here but it helps stabilize the grid a number of uh positives about DC when it reaches the Western converter station site which is the right hand there's another converter station where the power will be converted from DC back to AC and then at harborton it can be distributed further into the grid as AC next slide this is the route proposed route of the Bonneville Dam bypass I realize it's not in Oregon but I think it's important for people on both sides of the river to understand the project as a whole because it will involve and it will benefit both States so the idea is to come out of the water east of the Bonneville Dam travel primarily on State Route 14. bypass the dam and then re-enter the river south of the dam next slide so we talked about there we go if you could go back at it there we go we talked about a converter station what is a converter station again the purpose of a converter station is to have equipment and technology that will convert DC to AC or AC to DC so there will be two of these this particular photo is of a converter station that was built about 12 years ago in San Francisco uh there's a project very similar conceptually to this one using DC high voltage submarine technology that goes underneath the San Francisco Bay and so this converter station uh is right and essentially downtown uh exact downtown but it's in the city of San Francisco the sites are about five acres they look very much like a traditional the large building is a control building where the conversion takes place next slide there we go the construction methodology first of all has been done many places around the world most recently the San Francisco project and then there are two submarine cable projects that our company was responsible for for permitting for developing for constructing and we continue to operate those projects those both go between New Jersey and different parts of New York one goes into Manhattan and the other goes on to Long uh the graphic on the left sort of uh indicates how this is done there's a machine called a jet plow there is a if you see the sort of plow that extends below it it cuts a trench with water jets the trench is maybe 18 inches wide the cable is fed from the chip or barge into the hydroplow the jet plow and as the machined cuts the trench by fluidizing the the cable then lays down right into it as a simultaneous the fluidized sediment about three quarters of it will settle back down into the trench so uh this is a surprisingly low impact a method of installing major infrastructure particularly with the infrastructure being 12 inches or 14 inches in diameter if you count you know two of these bundled what you would see from the river is basically similar to uh to what you see on the right hand photo it's a barge in this case this is from our Neptune Project in uh in New Jersey on the Raritan River so you would see a barge and a work boat uh and that's what you would see and the uh the installation is very slow uh it probably covers about a mile and a half on average per day uh and a lot of the reason for that is to minimize the disruption of a sediment uh we expect that the installation of 100 miles could take a total of maybe four to six months uh the entire project because much of the construction is in the converter stations would take around three years this is our proposed schedule and we want to acknowledge that just because we put up a schedule doesn't mean that that's the schedule we we understand that and we're at the very beginning as uh Todd and Chris said of our permitting process the schedule has been formulated based on our own experience in building and permitting similar projects so on that we could see completing this project by the end of 2028 or perhaps the very beginning of 2029 the key point about that is that it means it's within the 2030 deadline for meeting the clean energy mandates that have already been passed by Washington and Oregon next slide kind of summarizing the key features first of all as I said before the purpose of the project is to help the states meet their already existing clean energy goals and do it in a substantial way 1100 megawatts meets a lot of need the process of installing the cable is low impact and again based on our experience we know that we will be taking care and this goes to something that uh fsec has already stated is that we can show a route on a map and believe that it's constructible but it only begins it's it's based on our limited understanding at the desktop level at this point so we would expect and we're already starting the process of detailed on the ground studies uh to determine what the impacts might be what the areas might be that need to be avoided if we can uh and so when we say it's designed we're not anywhere near final design we still need to take all that input and feedback and understand if there are areas that you know would require a change in route uh in order to uh avoid that kind of impact do of course believe that there's an advantage to this and that it has no visual impact and it takes away the kinds of risks that are often associated with transmission like wildfire risks severe climate that kind of thing so it it supports resiliency of the system in terms of potential benefits this is a major construction project we think that there's 300 to 400 jobs uh all told at Peak during the construction process the estimated cost at this point is about 1.5 billion maybe in today's um and we are pursuing a federal department of energy grant that would help alleviate that cost but",

        "text": " this is going to happen through a series of meetings and what I'm presenting here is our ideal scenario so this is our starting point of a schedule to give you a big overview of the different activities and the order in which will they will occur what I want to be very clear about is that we expect this to change we know that people's schedules change we know that priorities change through time and so again this is our starting point and we'll work to adhere to it as much as we can knowing that things will change through time and so we're starting off today with our kickoff we're in the month of October and as Tom already teed up we're going to be asking for information from you guys regarding energy data sources resilience plans other types of input including energy insecurity stories which we'll be touching on next following the kickoff we're going to focus on meetings that work to solicit feedback for each region throughout the state and we're going to um be addressing gaps in the data so we'll be doing data Gap data Gap assessments and then we also want input on what the threats to energy systems are for each of the different regions and we'll be um working on this phase of the project through the end of the year now we're also going to be meeting specifically with folks from the private sector so reaching out to electricity petroleum and natural gas Representatives again looking at data sources and threats to those Industries specifically and then we'll have a meeting focused on the S sp1 1567 so we'll be looking at um sites that can be recommended for increased fuel storage capacity now after we have all that data collected a team is going to do a risk assessment so they will analyze all of the data and they will draft draft risk mitigation measures and then we want to return to each of you guys and focusing again on these Regional perspectives making sure each region is um well represented so that you can validate the analytical findings the risk mitigation measures and the fuel sites that are recommended for increasing storage capacity and once you guys have validated all of those results then we're going to aim to visit every one of the different um regions in person to conduct hybrid meetings we're also going to work to visit each of the different tribal Nations and what we'll be doing in this round of meetings that will be in person with a hybrid format is we want you to rank what these mitigation measures are so we want to understand region for region tribe for tribe which of these mitigation measures are most important for you in your circumstances and then finally we will have a project wrapup or rollout meeting to conclude the entire project now I know that's a lot of meetings um but no you do not have to attend every one of them so we want to be very strategic in how we invite you to the meeting so that you can be as informative as possible and so I'll walk you through our strategy for inviting folks and first are the super easy ones which is today's meeting the kickoff and then the wrap up at the very end because everybody's invited to those meetings with the private sector meetings OB viously these will be directed only at folks that are in the private sector across these three Industries for electricity petroleum and natural gas and then the specific list of folks will be invited to the S sp5 1567 meeting we're still finalizing those that list of folks now the the meetings that are focused on these Regional perspectives which will be gathering information on the threats and then validating that initial risk assessment these are going to be based on which region you're associated with and so we need to understand which um region you feel like you can speak to the best and then that final round of meetings where we hope to attend every every um region in person and each of the tribal nations in person um these will obviously again be Associated you'll be invited based on which region you are associated with or which tribal Nation you are associated with so when we take this approach we're actually left with almost 150 folks who are not invited to any specific meeting beyond the kickoff and the wrapup the reason for this is there's a good portion of you that represent Oregon at a Statewide level so we don't know which region you would most want to attend and represent there also as I mentioned folks that are visiting and and supporting from outside of the state of Oregon or from DC or other states and then there are also some of you that represent multiple regions within the state of Oregon so again we wouldn't know which region would be most important for you and so again pointing to the survey that we'll have at the end of the meeting we're going to ask you guys to identify for us which region you want us to associate you with for this project now when you select your region you can tell us just one and that means you'll only get invitations in your inbox for the meetings that are directly applicable for that region you can also tell us every region if you want a whole bunch of emails in your inbox for every single meeting for every region we are happy to do that so if you want flexibility in your calendar um you are welcome to indicate all regions um the other thing is if you don't indicate a region for us by default we're going to sign you to the the um Portland metro region and you will be invited to those meetings only okay okay so with that I'm going to hand things back over to Odo so that they can um present energy and security stories thanks so um wanted to break break the ice a little bit here because I know we asked for what an energy and security story and I and I talked about you your ant's generator but really I want to just give some examples of other things that energy security and security might mean um I'm going to start off with uh one from earlier this year um so there were a lot of rainstorms in January of this year and um they there was splitting there was power dropping uh power cut offs and there was a major Landslide on Highway 101 along the coast near the town of point or Port Orford um the Oregon Department of energy uh closed all the lanes of Highway 101 for nearly a week and if you don't know Highway 101 is the only major road connecting communities on the Southern Oregon Coast with Oregon's major cities and the distribution Network to the north so folks in the area who wanted to head north found themselves with a multiple hour detour that's assuming they had gas in the tank and assuming there was gas to be had uh um so the closure of Highway 101 presented problems for fuel companies delivering product to communities now typically that fuel would come down through Eugene and then over and then down the coast but the landslide blocked that route so there were two options to get fuel um to that Community one would be to take um large trucks on roads that aren't necessarily always ready to have large trucks um which could cause traffic backups higher risk of accident um or to take smaller trucks um and go down through California and up because California has different rules for what size trucks can ride on their roads that than Oregon so we would have had to get a federal waiver um which needs a presidential declaration to get that waiver so not not a lot of good options here um so it's a good example uh of how a routine uh event such as our rainstorm or an atmospheric River can cause significant energy insecurity to one specific region of the state um and you know the Cascadia planning that we do incorporates landslides along the coast as one of the uh likeliest scenarios and it shows sort of an example of how planning for the worst case can really help um have a plan in place for when the lower frequency um or the higher frequency lower intensity events like a landslide along the coast which happens you know every uh 5 10 years um we can have a plan in place for that but also be ready for the big one um so um with that that's one form of energy energy insecurity which sort of impacts a sort of region to a town scale um but also individuals who had to make that long commute uh and and think about how to fill their tank with gas I'm going to to pass to Deana for the next energy and story he everyone I'm going to talk about jet fuel problems during some recent wildfires and you all know in recent years in Oregon our Wildfire seasons have been more severe and so in June of 2021 when um the coid um travel restrictions lifted we in Oregon experiened a sudden increase in commercial air travel and was coupled with an early Wildfire season and so it was just all the wrong conditions happening at the same time and we experienced initial jet fuel problems but really ultimately in this scenario it was a distribution problem so in Oregon with the exception of the Portland International Airport that gets a fuel pipe to them via one of the local terminals out of Portland all other jet fuel deliveries are made by truck from the Portland area throughout the state and so so um in June when we had um you know all the commercial air travel the early Wildfire season we did run into some problems and what was happening was that while there wasn't a real jet fuel issue Supply issue we we had problems connecting um the supplies the available supplies with certified jet fuel truck trucks and drivers and so um our our fuel Distributors that were already working at capacity were unable able to add unscheduled additional deliveries to their already packed schedules and so we found ourselves having some probable so what we had to do is work with all of our um regions in the west which is where the uh petroleum collaborative comes in but we were able to get on a call and work with some of our neighboring states for example Washington state provided us who weren't they weren't addressing Wildfire issues but they provided us a list of fuel distributors from their state that was able to help us uh support some of the fuel deliveries to the Medford Airport in southern Oregon so that was very helpful so that event just shows us that we don't need a catastrophic event to experience fuel issues in Oregon and so um we have worked with the Department of Forestry the department of Aviation since the 2021 wildfires we now have a fuel coordination group where every Wildfire season we stand up and we just monitor the situation and we facilitate um fuel requests and fuel deliveries to make sure that Wildfire response goes",

        "text": " um secretary cornette could you please call the role Katie IM yes Richard delin yes Kent how yes Cindy Condon Perry choc yes Marcy gr yes motion carries Mr chair and I and I have the language as motion by Vice Condon okay thank you secretary cornette next item is the Oregon Department of Environmental quality solar noise rule making action item again uh Thomas Jackson God I keep saying that Thomas Jackman rules coordinator you you GNA million other people no worries um uh thank you uh for that introduction and we are now on my last agenda item for today we're uh we're going to have a busy you're going to be seeing a lot of me in the future uh so get used to it we're we're trying to get through as many rule changes as we can um so um what is this DQ solar noise R making so I talked about it briefly at the um the introduction of the schedule for 202 uh what year is this 2024 earlier this year uh but effectively uh these are not our rules so you are not necessarily you're not uh the notice you're proposal making was actually already issued by um DEQ the comment period has concluded so we're now in the sort of final stages of this Ru making and uh which relates to their rules in Oar 340 division 35 specifically the noise control rules related to um VAR uh commercial facilities so uh just as a way of background back in 2004 the environmental equality commission amended division 35 to streamline the sighting of wind energy facilities which is primarily what was being proposed at that time um to streamline the the sighting of those facilities while continuing to protect the public um basically all we're proposing today or I'm not proposing it it's already been proposed but all the the rules as proposed is to take what was a laid out for the wind turbine uh sighting and apply it to solar sighting as well uh and do that and nothing more so what does that what does that mean uh it means two things one uh allowing for an assumed ambient background noise level of 26 DB and allowing uh solar facility to increase the ambient statistical noise levels by greater than 10 DBA but notably not above the limits specified in table 8 if and only if a land owner uh the affected land owners uh sign a waiver which would occur via an easement or a lease on the on the property um and would be recorded with the county so uh just sort of a kind of an FYI here uh an assumed background noise of of 26 is a very conservative number it's not zero but for all intents and purposes it might as well be it's it's you know uh based on my reason research I I think like you know the average Forest you know undeveloped Forest is like uh 30 you know 35 or 36 so it's very very low and there and and so it makes sense that if we're going to say look you don't need to you don't need to spend the time in resources to go measure it you know you can just assume this number the number is going to be lower than realistically any measured value would actually be and considering that this number is what determines the measured increased you might ask the question why would anybody go with 26 if the measured value would let's say be 35 because that would mean uh the you're increasing the likelihood you're going to trigger that 10 DBA uh amount well the answer is if you know you're going to trigger the 10 DBA amount uh if you went and measured it then you might as well not measure it and save the money and just assume 26 DBA so uh it's just about you know efficiency here but it's a very conservative number that that serves to oregonians uh at a very conservative level does that make sense to everybody okay and then this red line here is the absolute limit so you could never go above that regardless of the existence of a waiver that's the 50 DB for uh the nighttime uh and 55 DBA during the daytime sorry was there a question yes cherof for the record this Perry chalk dud um listening to this and being out on the ground around multiple solar projects I'm not sure I remember any noise at all coming from solar projects we'll get to that we'll get to that um so yeah no that's a great it's a great question and uh you know most people experience with with solar is just you know like I have solar on my roof it it doesn't make a sound it's completely inert uh totally silent so the question uh you might be asking is why are we bothering good segue there council member sh to um so the answer is not uh has nothing to do with solar and indeed it's it really I mean the the wind turbines move and make sound but uh I would I would wager guess that that wasn't the reason for this rulemaking either it has to do with the commercial scale sort of uh facilities here and I I have just a little video here that I thought this is not by the way this is not Ed to a solar array or anything this is just to show you um sort of like commercial scale electrical Transformer uh and inverters do make very audible sound and indeed uh as Chase pointed out earlier if you recall they have a solar project that currently is measured to trigger this 10d increase so they are very excited about the prospect of being able to do to do uh a waiver seeking a waiver as opposed to uh mitigation um so yeah it it isn't the solar panels themselves that are necessarily making the sound it's it's all the electrical equipment that it's connected to does that make uh make sense for the record this Perry choc again um you know on looking at it we should be more concerned about the noise coming from the power lines from Bonville plant because it it's disturbing it's really really loud the one that runs through Central Oregon yeah so um I'm wondering know why we shouldn't we be looking at something that makes some real noise uh that's a great question and the answer with respect to this one is this these rules don't address that instance so we're sort of this role making was by a few different factors but primarily direction from the state to do what we can to sort of make it easier or more efficient to site renewable energy projects in the state of Oregon and this is just a very lwh hanging fruit so there might be other you know issues around you know noise or sort of industrial um externalities that are caused by energy but the sort of outside the scope of this rle making but that doesn't mean that you know the state or uh shouldn't look at it or or address it sure okay yeah counselor Imes um Tom does this pertain to the storage facilities as well no this is only the language as it currently uh is in there it's just it says when and now it's going to say wind and solar energy facilities I if I may so it would be if there is a battery storage facility associated with a solar or battery energy storage associated with a solar project it would apply so you know if you look at like a typical solar project that's being proposed it includes transmission lines Transformers inverters um and most of them also include battery storage it would apply to all of those elements of the facility um as part of the overall solar facility um but because the council doesn't have jurisdiction over a standalone battery energy storage it wouldn't apply to a battery energy storage facility if that was proposed um you know to the you know the the local government or even if somebody wanted to have Council review that now the other standards associated with the DEQ noise r rules would still apply that particular element these um assume 26 DBA would not though just you know would not apply for an just a standalone battery energy storage facility so some of the facilities that we're currently reviewing and have been approved do have battery storage as part of as part of the solar facility correct yes and um I think just from my perspective um and living in Morrow County um what I hear from the public and news articles or whatever um that the battery storage uh equipment and facility is actually what noisy is what people are saying yeah correct there is the cooling um you know of that which includes fans and those can be those can be noisy and those could exceed it but but these rules would apply to those if it was part of a a facility all right thank you yes exactly so uh only yeah only if it was a standalone would would it not apply but for if you're seeking a solar side certificate for a solar energy facility that your the analysis for the standards applies to all the stuff that's part of that facility which could include incl could include batteries so if you assume 260a that means anything over 360 evba would exceed the limit and you would need to seek a waiver that means you know between a whisper and in a modern fridge uh so it doesn't take much to to trigger the 10 DB exceedance um so it could be pretty quiet uh obviously there's sound attenuation so um meaning you know if you're two miles away from it you may not hear it but if you're a land owner that's directly adjacent to the project that's where the no noise sensitive receptors are are going to pick up potentially more than 10 DBA increase um so uh which which brings the question of why this is an action item and not just an information item uh and there essentially there's a statute that says that when other rules are being proposed that sort of have an impact on uh Council the sighting of energy projects that uh Council has to review them to uh determine whether or not they need to or to determine whether or not they conform to State policy so that sort of informs the options here we just have two options uh one option one would be um approve the recommended finding that no changes are required to the DEQ rules at as proposed to conform them to State policy and then option two would be recommended EQ that changes be made to the rules that they proposed to conform them to State policy so and again those changes are the allowing the developer to assume a 26 DBA ambient level and to uh seek waivers from land owners uh which again the land owners do not have to provide whether or not you know regardless of what is being offered they can just say I don't want a project it's too loud and you there's no amount of money you can",

        "text": " on the temporary and permanent impacts of the facility the total mitigation obligation for this facility uh as proposed is estimated to be 299.8 Acres uh for threaten endangered species um the certificate holder did conduct wildlife and Botanical surveys at the site both in support of this request and in the requests and proceedings on other facilities in the area um the surveys do identify Washington ground squirrel colonies uh within the proposed site boundary um the uh avoidance of category one occupied Washington ground scroll habitat required in the site certificate would be maintained um the department has recommended some administrative conditions to uh condition pre1 uh related to ground squirrel to incorporate ODFW guidance on survey methodology and and what needs to be surveyed um botanical surveys identified occurrences of Warren milkvetch which is a state listed threatened plant um throughout the site um the uh certificate holder estimates that the construction and operation of the facility as proposed and request for Amendment one would result in the disturbance of approximately 50 acres of occupied La small fetch habitat um Council previously required avoidance of all occupied War smoke fetch habitat um but did provide for an exception process um as MP packs were foreseen here uh the department um recommends that the council um accept a mitigation plan that's similar to what was contemplated through that exception process and a mitigation plan has been developed in coordination uh with the Oregon Department of Agriculture um and we recommend that the council accept that plan um as developed by the the certificate holder and the Department of Agriculture the mitigation actions would include seed collection O A in planting uh and would be implemented by the organ firment of Agriculture or subcontractors for historic cultural and archaeological resources um pedestrian surveys were conducted uh for most of the site um and uh historic and cultural sites and objects were identified within the proposed site boundary um the majority of identified resources are pre-c contct rock features uh that are unevaluated for eligibility in the National registered and therefore considered to be likely eligible for listing on the national register of places um the council previously required the certificate holder established 200 foot avoidance buffers around all likely eligible um resources until appropriate mitigation had been approved by the department um and required an archaeological monitor to be present if those buffers were not maintained uh in the request the certificate holder represents that avoidance buffers with that 200 foot buffer would not be maintained for up to 10 sites in one objects um but that the resources themselves would not be impacted so uh some construction or activity within 200 ft but not directly impacting the resources um the to minimize impact to those resources the certificate holder proposes to in uh Implement and inadvertent Discovery plan and then to ensure that a tribal monitor or qualified archaeological uh qualified archaeologist is present whenever construction occurs within the 200 foot buffer um that proposal has been discussed with the confederated confederated tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation uh Pro cultural resource program staff and and the department as well and the department recommends the council am Insight certificate conditions to incorporate um for Wildfire prevention and risk mitigation the council adopted the standard after the previous review um of this facility um so all conditions related to Wildfire are new um as mentioned before the majority of the area added to the site is in grassland habitat and wall remote um those grasslands do carry a moderate high too high uh Wildfire risk um particularly because there's a higher probability burning and then um a faster spreading fires um the DPO recommends the council impose new conditions to require compliance with the Wildfire mitigation plan um and that plan is attached to the um and then finally for the cumulative effects standard for wind energy facilities the certificate holder did provide some evidence suggesting that uh cumulative effects of wind development in the columia plateau EC region may result in adverse population level impacts to some sensitive bird and bat species uh the certificate holder represented that it was setting back facility components from waterways and sensitive rap Raptor nests uh in part to reduce those cumulative impacts or their contribution to those cumulative impacts more accurately um and so the DPL recommends the council impose a new conditions based on those representations um in addition uh additional mitigation for impacts would uh only be required if fatality thresholds established in the wildlife monitoring and mediation plan were determined to have been exceeded during post construction fatality monitoring um because those thresholds haven't been Revisited since 2018 uh we do uh recommend that threshold be revised to address potential cumulative effects uh and that we would be looking into what the new threshold should be uh in consultation with uh Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife finally with regards to other state laws and rules um the DPO recommends that the facility would continue to comply with DEQ noise regulations and uh orgon Water Resources Department regulations for groundwater and surface water um this the facility With The Changes proposed and request for Amendment one uh would uh require a removal fill permit um there is I I think some impacts from the transmission line and some access roads that that would require fill activities uh the certificate holder has elected to obtain um the required removal fill permit directly from the orgon Department of State Lions um so rather than have the council make findings on compliance with the removal fill laws we would recommend the council adopt a condition uh to require the certificate holder to demonstrate that they've complied either by obtaining the permit or showing that they no longer need it uh before in construction okay uh so that was a very quick overview of what's in the DPO I am happy to go back and revisit anything if if anyone has questions um otherwise um I'll just give some brief comments on uh public participation and in the hearing tonight um so the issuance of the public notice and the DPO did uh initiate a public comment period um the public May submit written comments by mail email public comment portal hand delivery or fax until April 4th at 5:00 pm um and may also provide oral comments tonight um the council will not accept public comments on request for Amendment one on the DPO after the close of the record um and just to say uh failure to raise a relevant issue either orally or at the hearing or timely submitted written comment precludes further participation in the fsec process uh essentially by preing consideration of that issue in a contested case proceeding um next slide please uh so the council may allow the record to remain open for the certificate holder to respond to public comments a received if requested um as discussed earlier because the public comment period will end between Council meetings we are recommending the council direct the record to remain open uh for certificate hold responses until April 8th 2024 at 5:00 p.m. and authorize us to allow a further continuance if requested by the certificate holder and then um finally just to to restate this that um to request a contested case hearing a person must demonstrate that they provided a comment on the record in person or in writing before the April 4th deadline uh they must have raise the issue they seek on the proceeding on on the record with sufficient specificity uh so that the council the department and the applicant understand the issues raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue and to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue um issues that are not within the council's jurisdiction are not eligible for a contested case Madam councilor if it's appropriate now I just had a question on the presentation itself um when I read all the materials for this presentation the one thing that struck me uh it it's very clear to me that all the additional inventories that are required or expansion of those inventories are going to be required the mitigation is going to be required all the interaction with respective parties going to be required um but what really struck me was um uh the expansion of the site boundary and um I this I know that this is area that appears from the topographical maps I've seen as being largely Rolling Hills and there're only going to be certain areas where you'll be able to put wind turbines but the expansion is from an area that was about miles uh for the footprint of the uh project to 116 miles so about a 7 fold expansion um a relatively modest expansion in what about onethird expansion in the number of turbin and about a onethird increase in the theoretical amount of power produced but with that level of expansion is do you foresee as the analyst that this site is going to require significantly more mod monitoring by the uh Council than the previous proposal I mean it is a 17-fold expansion in the area being impacted I council member delin and I'll just make sure it's appropriate to respond okay um yeah I believe that uh with the larger site boundary and the expanded energy facility there would be uh more monitoring needed um particularly I think during construction uh for erosion control uh and for noxious we control things like that I think um while the obligations for inspections at the larger um during operations would also be more it's more relative to the the increase in in um operating infrastructure so okay and followup question well I realize the sites for the uh for the various uh well the number of um turbin is limited and they've obviously selected the best sites that meet their requirements and meet the other requirements that we have uh is there anything in the proposal that would give you the impression that there may be a future expansion within this 116 square area I council member Devon I am probably not the best person to respond to that particular comment but um since the certificate holder is in the room with us I I believe they they possibly could okay well thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you councelor delin and and we've got another comment from counselor Grail thank you um Chris I'm not sure that I heard you correctly so I would like to ask you I think I heard you say the certificate holder speaks and I'm going to say expedited but I don't know that's the word that you used um and then you mentioned public comment and I don't know if I combine that in my own head uh or what and so I just would like to ask that and then perhaps a clarifying question if you could respond to that um yes council member Grail uh I did say expedited um that isn't intended to be a formal term like it's an expedited review or a special criteria um we uh it just means that they",

        "text": " have more time on it that study was more of a broad in terms of contributions to the grid some of which being resilience reliability related but but the study wasn't necessarily concentrated on that however as we move forward what i think what the collective um understanding how that how that is evolving um is very much along the lines of reliability um and resilience and uh this is an area of active research and and um certainly a big part of the study we have ongoing right now other studies that are happening down in california and and i also spend time working directly for the department of wind energy technology office and this subject of reliability um through coastal uh power generation and reversal of power flows uh sort of we're still understanding all the benefits that could accrue uh as well as as adverse impacts so it's um it's an exciting area to uh to be working in right now please next slide you very much so i guess it's like i could cut off a little bit sorry about that but um if we just start on the left half of the of the slide uh to begin with the first two statements i'll just read those uh most of the clean energy goals which are shown in this insert diagram here the clean energy standards and any offshore one specific legislation at the state and i believe jason you you overview those before i hop on the call but most of those uh which are which are prevalent uh in the western uh will be met through variable renewable energy resources and the scale at which they will be end and the speed with which the accelerate the transition will our formidable challenges to the power sector and specifically there are challenges around resource adequacy so the ability of generation to serve load at any given time so the timing of production the timing of loads the flexibility of loads is part of that conversation as well and that's that's evolving over time and then also you know grid reliability and resilience aspects um which are have more to do the various reserves that are required across the system to balance side intermittency any sort of supply side and transmission contingency events you know operational impacts which accrues that just the reality of operating a power system um there are a lot of moving pieces uh that are required that we have a certain thank you for moving it over that's pretty cool you can do that live um there are many many pieces that that are inter that uh interplay and the sort of the interplay of those pieces has sort of evolved given a certain mix a certain generation mix in a certain demand uh footprint and and temporal uh all those things are changing and and certainly on the supply side changing drastically quickly that's what the plot shows and everyone's tracking that i think um so it's really a new world and so now moving to the right half of the slide here uh what's the role for offshore one we have a bit of a clean slate right now particularly out west there are of course people tracking call areas that have been announced um in california first but then also most recently draft call areas in oregon there's an opportunity here to to kind of cultivate um some resources to find those that provide benefits beyond energy beyond you know we know that offshore when right now floating offshore wind doesn't provide the most competitive cost of energy resource but that is changing rapidly as patrick uh discussed and has projected in his work but beyond that the energy production value but what else what else is it how about the temporal value what about the capacity value um of the resource particularly as we move to a world with less and less dispatchable generation so these are the questions we asked these are things we're interested in what we studied in 2020 and um and then what we talked about last week in san francisco at pacific offshore wind summit and what we're concentrating on right now um with our work so what are we interested in um is is correlations with with load and net load as especially as vre variable renewable energy resources become more and more prevalent on our system and then we also think about future emerging variable renewable energy production that will be decided to you know in compliance with house bills 2021 um so and not to mention the pure economics of power generation when what is the capacity factor certain key times of the day and year and then specifically what are power flow impacts associated with place and generation in a spot where the grid did not evolve to take it yeah that's that's the big change here um so there's an opportunity with existing uh um transmission infrastructure in oregon to incorporate power flows on the order of two gigawatts um and that's uh and then you know that actually correlates or corresponds with an installed capacity that's higher than two gigawatts but when we think about actual power flows onto the system um we have a couple of studies now kind of pointing to around two gigawatts of a flow directly to on existing transmission networks but i will say and that's that was kind of the focus of of the study and and and some other studies at that time but now we're moving to think about think a little bit bigger you know what now knowing that number what would it take uh capture some of these benefits at a larger scale and that's that's sort of where the conversation is shifting but the house bill 3375 number came out of these uh was partially motivated by some of this work in in early 2020 please next uh please move to the next thank you so just just to touch on a few elements of that study and then mention the the current study and then i'll i'll hand it back to jason um one aspect of this study was this kind of review of inherent correlation or complementarity of generation of just the natural timing of the natural resource so this is without energy storage just just you know what is the natural inherent complementarity of offshore wind with loads across the major balancing authorities in oregon and and the pacific northwest and then also with uh existing and emerging variable renewable energy resources so we ran one aspect was a vre somebody used that term a lot variable renewable energy um a complementarity study that study was based on the uh the resources that are shown in this image here um so of course we had four different locations that span the oregon coastline astoria newport reedsport and port-au-prince all located these are offshore wind queries of offshore wind resources offshore wind speeds namely at 100 meter hub heights and those were those are all approximately kind of ranging between 20 and 40 kilometers offshore into the ocean but that's the offshore one footprint at the left side of the slide and then we looked at some in the green both the green dots i come from the onshore wind industry so i'm very familiar with the columbia river gorge uh footprint we queried three different sites in that in that area and southeastern washington there's there's another cluster of you know strong wind resource there and then of course any pacific people on the phone or or specifically ratepayers um you know really strong wyoming wind resources that are wheeled to serve loads in the in the pacific northwest so we consider the temporal and spatial aspects of those resources and then full credit to oto here on this on this part of the study they pointed me to utility scale pv power production in central and i guess it's south central um oregon um i always forget about that old half of oregon that's the east of the the the nevada boundary there the nevada california boundary but really it's kind of kind of central southern oregon there's some utility scale uh pv uh project development so these are the resources we queried over time and we ran these um sorry to show some math but the the pearson correlation just a simple pearson correlation coefficient which just looks just tries to quantify in one number how two different series of data correlate with each other um and we did that on an hourly basis and group the results by season and i'll show some of the high level high level findings there but i'll i would refer to the published work and happy to take questions afterwards so we don't end up down a rabbit hole taking everybody's time just a quick quick note here that complementarity these what motivates this sort of a check you know we'd like to see that it would be interesting to note uh any inherent correlation of resource production with load right that's that's helpful if in time loads or generation is available when loads are available that's capacity value and um and that's that's an adequacy good type of contribution so that's valuable from a reliability and resilience perspective um and then also you can think of you know everyone's probably familiar with this idea of the duct curve or intermittent generation with solar is really predictable so you have a sense for a very clean diurnal profile most of the time um if you can find a resource that comes in in the evening hours in particular when the when the solar resource is receding that's valuable right because that that maybe limits some of the strain on hydropower or other other kind of dispatchable resources um to help fill the shortfall there so that's that's another way of thinking about the implications of complementarity to reliability and resilience next slide please so we made a bunch of the slide 51 i guess this left prior thank you so much so in the in the report here um which i have referenced in these slides if you'd like to find it we provided parallelograms or we we did this kind of hourly complementarity put them on a matrix there was one of those on a couple slides back it's kind of colorful matrix just to show um the the the the qualitative um uh alignment with loads hourly and uh hourly production or of of gener of electricity or consumption of electricity depending on what um which item you're looking at on the corollagram we made these um by season using multiple years of data and we came up with the following conclusions here um just some high level conclusions there are other conclusions in those corollograms but first starting the left side with resource complementarity so again this is how supply side resources might work well together or not uh the first one that we noticed was that offshore wind um there was much there was a great degree of alignment hourly across the full oregon coast um not a whole lot of variation there that which was interesting um but there was some ability inherent ability of offshoring to help balance onshore wind in the columbia river gorge and",

        "text": " crossing protected areas um so protect areas that are listed underneath the standard and one of those provisions is that if functionally the proposed facility is co-located with an existing utility right-of-way such is the case with the proposed route in the area of of lad marsh um that's uh right here in union county not too far away so we have recommended protected areas condition one because lad marsh is a wildlife management area that's managed by odf and w odf and w provided comments and the provisions under this condition protected area condition one um incorporate requests from odf and w and coordinating activities with um odf and and that was for the proposed route um and now and then there's also the morgan lake alternative which um we did have a public comment earlier and i know when i talked about this may help forgive me i forgot who who raised it but we were talking about the proposed route and the mill creek route and then there's the morgan lake alternative so here we are in beautiful legrand union county and so this is the proposed route now this route and then blm's nepa review was called the mill creek route so when the mill creek when somebody says mill creek route for afsec and in our f-sec speech it's the proposed route and then there's the morgan lake alternative so that just as i wanted to kind of paint that picture in our minds so for this lad marsh the condition one applies to the proposed route and then for the morgan lake alternative if the morgan lake alternative is selected um then there is there is this overlap because we talked about the site boundary i'll just make this bigger we talked about the site boundary being of the microsighting corridor and so but we know that the actual right-of-way for the transmission line is going to be smaller than the 500-foot site boundary so what this condition too is because that morgan lake alternative is not within a utility corridor what this condition two does is it it it does not allow or requires them to cite the final right-of-way outside of the boundaries of the protected area because there's just a little bit of overlap like in a map of the site boundary it clips a corner so this condition is saying that no none of your facility components can be cited inside this protected area yes councilman condon um kellen i just want to make sure i'm following you so if i look if i'm reading uh in the proposed order maybe i shouldn't be reading the proposed order right now but the recommended protected areas condition so the proposed facility has been struck from there it doesn't it's not proposed it's just the facility regardless of route it's it in the reading of it i'm gonna sarah's gonna find because i i don't want to bumble around too much here but maybe you can tell me what i mean it's possible that we took out proposed because conditions are supposed conditions generally read it has says certificate holder the conditions are written under the assumption that it this is going to end up being the site certificate condition so rather than applicant it says certificate holder rather than proposed facility they say facility does that look like what that edit was made right it just seems like um this condition would apply no man no matter what route is that that can't is that appropriate i mean no matter which route was the reason i'm asking the question is karen you said it would only affect that the proposed route and so i'm trying to make distinguish between an alternative and an alternative route work chosen if we can look into that i think we need to look at a map or we so pull it up so yeah no i miss i misspoke in my presentation so correct um and maybe it would be helpful i can pull up a more uh succinct map set because the one map set that i pulled up isn't isn't very detailed so this does apply to b to the facility right um but then it's like where it separates off so here in the findings a small segment of the site boundary for the morgan lake alternative so i can actually pull this up here which will kind of show us where they break off where the proposed route kind of separates from the morgan lake and that is the portion that this condition applies to i'll try to pull up that map set its sarah's computer's frozen here so i'm let me see where is this at map 10. so mr chair this is hanley's my question is to cindy are you are you referring to condition number two one one yeah and i'm really trying to make the distinction between facility and the there you know they're two different things in in my mind i guess there's the transmission line wherever it is which is the facility no matter what route so but isn't one referring to essentially towers not the power line uh well it references facility so i'm i didn't know that that facility is limited i'm just trying to be clear okay i understand i i would have to to be totally clear i just i need to find the map set because we have to go we have to go to the location where we have to find lad marsh just to be i think that it's the area or basically the proposed facility because it's all the proposed route which is just the proposed facility and that until we get to a place where there is an alternative and then it's still the proposed route and then such and such alternative and i believe in the lad marsh area this is that like it happens kind of at the juncture where i think that so condition one but i but i rather than just saying that off of memory i would need to confirm that in a condition and with maps so okay i i i if it's that it this will apply no matter what route then that that's fine want to understand it because i heard it as yes this proposed wrap-up yeah and that's and that's how i that's how i did frame it absolutely so yeah thank you so i am going i don't know if we have an ongoing question i don't know if we want me to find a map set or if i want to okay pursue it all right because i can i can come back i'm almost okay so that is an an interesting to the proposed order um and i'm not going to go into because this is like the gray area of crossover with with issues that people rose or had in the um contested case but the proposed order discusses um the visual impacts in visual impact um and i i'm talking about this here under protected areas because that's where we talked about it in the proposed order because it's the first standard you get to but the same visual impact assessment applies for protected areas scenic resources and recreation so and um and then it does also have some um you know some nexus when we get to kind of the discussion of mitigation under the cultural because we're looking at the conditions for visual impact mitigation over underneath that so and the reason why i brought up the uh the council's uh definition of significant uh is because the applicant and the department and shippo um did work together on generating a very specific methodology that derived from you know blm methodology and then forest service methodology from uh for visual impacts um within forest areas and then wove in f-sec's definition of significant to make it more but or maybe more catered to the council's process because this is the lens that each of those standards evaluates impacts through so i'm not going to go into a lot of detail here um but you know in this slide there is a an evaluation of the baseline conditions and then there's an assessment of the the impact likelihood and magnitude and then there's the consideration of intensity causation and context which weaves in the impact assess uh integrity intensity degree to which impacts the context and the potential significance so in each of these and we'll just kind of keep this slide and this is very high level it is more detailed but in each of the applicable exhibits for each of these standards there are these impact tables so every resource that got swept up by protected areas cdick recreation um that got evaluated underneath of those has these you know impact tables that this for visual impacts this was applied to and then there's this whole assessment baseline evaluation of the magnitude likelihood then the application of of significance so that that information is is in there and then the proposed order summarizes and then i have um a slide i had a slide but because i'm using a pdf we're just going to kind of go to this slide i had a table that had a just snippet from the proposed order and it's a table protected areas with visual impacts but then this is this picture is crossed over it will just try to zoom this up here and you know i'm sorry it's hard to see but this is just i thought that this is just kind of like some of the things that we look at right or that are looked at in the application and i know you can't really see those i'll go in bigger this is one you know just under two miles away and then we're kind of getting closer and then you can see transmission structures but this is one of the what i think is interesting about this and here we can start seeing them is that you just look at the skyline behind it right your sky coloring the topography changes the color of of the environment behind it whether or not it's a forested area or not and these are all aspects that were evaluated or applied in that visual impact assessment this visual simulation here isn't of a particular area it just is a demonstration of that the the context and the the the site a specific aspect of each of the sites evaluated you know matter and and change the outcome of the visual impact assessment and that concludes my my portion oh except oh i'm nope wait wait no i forgot okay i just i just wanted to just i just wanted it to and now i'm gonna continue with scenic okay oh that's large okay okay so for scenic resources the analysis area protected areas went out 20 for scenic resources we go out 10 scenic resources and as the the the explains to us are that these are resources that have um identified as significant or important in land management plans from federal agencies state agencies tribal governments so the task here to evaluate scenic resources is it's several steps we go through the the management plans or the applicant and then the department goes through the management plans and there are resources identified and we look at those resources and whether or not they're our identity but are they",

        "text": " want to unmute yourself hi good afternoon um I guess my biggest concern on this is the requirements and the money allocation um $50,000 in my experience is not would not even come close to covering the requirements for this so I'm just really curious how um others or brainstorm on leveraging you know does the technical assistance does that count against the $50,000 is it included in it like what's the Matrix to actually make this work I would imagine the majority of counties don't have a person who does energy resiliency so there's not there's not an entity within my County that's like oh yeah this makes sense I would have no idea how to write scope of work or even um you know start this project and then $50,000 to bring on a consultant to run it for me completely is not even close to that so how do we leverage the funding um Andor all of the things that have to get done when um this is kind of outside of normal scope of work currently yeah that's a that's a great question um there's a lot in there I would say um one option to that I know some counties are exploring to make those funds go a little bit further is the cohort option um and pooling their funds to hire a technical assistance provider um yes a technical assistance provider would be that that would be coming out of that $50,000 is the attention of those funds is to pay for County staff time or technical assistance provider both um and you know we are keeping our eyes and ears is open for potential matching fund opportunities um for the actual planning work that will certainly be something that I will flag and share out if some come through the door that I learn about um and you know in terms of like where to start how to draft that scope of work perhaps that's something where you know you submit your application I connect you to the staff at Energy Trust and they might be able to talk you through a little bit more of what that looks like I understand there you know it's can be a big learning curve and um I think it is you know is a technical field um so we would just do our best to support you in getting those questions answered and helping you feel comfortable to move forward with that planning work I think that's part of the issue though is uh I'm going to be requesting information requesting money to do a plan that I don't even know if I can do right so you and I so I think that's part of the concern is not um in order to take this to my board for money and Contracting you know I'm telling them that I can implement this plan and then that I would have any general fund or out of my budget to be able to support whatever components to meet the requirements and I can't say that right now I couldn't go and apply for the funding um to verify to them that with the $50,000 and even any of my time that I was uh not going to charge against the grant just to manage it I right now cannot meet the requirements of that plan with the and be able to say that confidently to accept the money to then start drawing down on technical assistance um and then go that far and then find out well actually we don't have the ability the time um I think Greg put in about trying to finish before August because even if I started now I only a few months before Fire season again for us down here so I just have concerns about like I don't want to waste opportunity for quote unquote free money because I think these are plans needed for sure but you're gonna it's just nearly impossible I feel with maybe exception of a few counties uh so I have I just have a lot of concern on that front um and while the cohart idea sounds great we're also now going to ask a lead County to take on a fiscal responsibility for other counties to M to be able to implement that plan and adopt it and now I'm held on like I'm going to be held responsible quote unquote as the Contracting entity to take those monies and make sure that the plan is implemented in the other cohort counties um so that's another difficulty another difficult component um when you're talking about funds has there been any applications submitted by counties at this point no not yet but we do know that there is interest and you know several counties particularly in cohorts have expressed interest in moving forward um you know we have a long application window so I don't think it creates a ton of pressure to get it in the door immediately which is okay however you know the sooner applications come in the longer that planning window is I hear your concerns I think they are valid um you know it's valid to be concerned about making sure that you can deliver on what you're moving ahead on I get that um and you know we are working with what we are given and doing our best we will have an opportunity to provide feedback to the legislature make suggestions for the future I really hope that as many counties as possible can take advantage of this opportunity and there is an opportunity for us to provide feedback on this important planning and make potentially some changes for the future um in terms of Greg's flag in the comments about August 2025 um you know there is some flexibility in in the deadline as I mentioned there is a potential to extend until December 31st 2025 even at that point we have created what we call the good faith clause which is if you reach December 31st 2025 and your plan is not complete if you can demonstrate that put in good faith effort to complete the plan in the time provided meet those requirements and you just you know for various reasons haven't been able to if we're are not going to revoke the funds we'll say please continue forward continue with your planning um so Our intention really is to be a good partner to counties we understand constraints we just really want to get some great planning done um on the work and as you said Hol is really important so um we have a a few hands raised and then also a question the chat so um I think that um we're going to go in order so Sylvia and then um Greg and then melind syvia do you want to come off mute sure thank you um I have two very short questions so I hope you'll forgive me for having to but um my first question is is it the August dece are these August and December deadlines statatory or do you have flexibility on that because you know I I I hear I don't remember um back there's a couple commenters who have expressed concerns with being able to pull that in a year even a year and a half might be tight and so to the extent that you have flexibility and again I don't know if this is in statue that it needs to be by August or December or if if this is a programmatic decision so that's my first question and the second is uh the statue calls on the utilities to cooperate with us on uh information um in your conversations with the utilities have they identified wanting to go to like what one point of contact for requests related to this program or um do we just go through our usual channels um that we have as as local governs thank you great questions I'm going to answer your first question I'm also going to look to Max um for his response as well so it's a little bit of both this program sunsets in statute um January 2nd 2026 so it is a limited duration program within that there are some programmatic choices around the spec specificity of those deadlines but that is why we have have that extension because we also have concerns about the timeline being a barrier and it's a you know a program rolled out for the twoe bium so a little bit of both um as I said we have that good faith Clause we really are trying to be cognizant of the fact that there is some pressure around that timeline and you know we have um our due diligence to the legislature and to the statute and uh to the program that we need to do on our end as well um and then in terms of the utilities we um have done some Outreach to our um consumer owned utilities through utility organizations but not directly to each utility trying to lift some of the burden um in terms of Outreach on their end so I would suggest that you go directly to your point of contact however if you have questions um you can direct them to me I can also connect you with staff at Energy Trust potentially to think about who the best contact might be if you don't if you have concerns about going to your normal contact or wondering if there might be someone that's a better fit so happy to talk through that oneon-one as well and Max sorry I didn't leave for you no no that's okay that's all good um I agree with I agree with what you said Hannah um I would use your regular contacts with your utility companies um which is probably more straightforward for electric or natural gas for fuels uh you may have to talk if you don't already know you may have to go talk to to um I don't know maybe your Public Works departments or whoever is the buyer of fuels for your fleet vehicles or something like that um that might be able to connect you with your fuel provider and you know for the bigger counties it might be multiple companies that provide fuel um so that's not that might just be something to navigate through if you do run into to just second what Hannah said if there are if you really aren't sure who to contact uh let us know and we'll see what we can do um Odo has relationships with just about every Energy company in the state and can probably help make some connections um okay thank you uh Greg go please feel free to unmute and then I'm also recognizing we have eight minutes left and there is a um two questions now um in the chat um great uh so I just I I fully get where this this whole program is coming from and where it's what what the intent is I'm just wondering um you know for for example I'm in Maran County and it we are just getting a Contractor on board from our 2023 uh June 2023 grant funding Point um because it does take that long it took that long for us to go out for to find a contractor to get it all approved to get it through our process to get approval to even apply",

        "text": " was out for public review so just really encourage you to look at our website on that let me know if you need help yes Ryan will be a good resource for you so I mentioned the tri party agreement here um EPA ecology and due signed a legally binding trip party agreement and consent order May of 1989 Milestones were developed for rec and cir cleanup so um the Hamford sitewide permit application material was originally Incorporated through TPA m Stones not all the facilities and dangerous Waste Management units were included in the first Hamford sightway permit and so if you go on the website and you look at the current 8C permit and you review the standard permit conditions you can see the history of the development of the Hampford site white permit and the different unit groups that came in and were closed out of the permit and if you will have questions just feel free to stop me um just a little bit about the Hampford site wde permit history the first Hamford sitewide permit was issued 1994 currently we're in revision 8C we have 22 unit groups in this revision it's separated into standard permit conditions that apply to all the unit groups as well as attachments or documents in support of the standard conditions operating unit groups corrective Action Unit groups closing unit groups and post closure unit groups we had a revision nine go out for public review for the a renewal so every 10 years a permit has to be renewed um as you can see it was a little bit past 10 years that we went out with the renewal in 2012 it took quite a bit of time to get the renewal prepared um 37 unit groups uh was included in the renewal um um and we incorporated all those who were considered interim status since then and I'll just say after the renewal was um provided for public review it went out for 120-day public comment period we had multiple public hearings throughout the Pacific Northwest we received 5,000 comments on that per renewal since then we have been addressing the comments we are working through every unit group every agenda to prepare a revised renewal in 2024 and that will be um revision 9A and that will go out for public review in 2024 it will include 50 unit groups it will incorporate all the inter status units and it maintains the same organization as I mentioned in HC so I'm going to um move on to R D and D permits a little bit that ask a question yes what type of waste are we talking about you said it wasn't radioactive but it was dangerous dangerous waste and dangerous waste components it would be like the tank Farms it'd be waste from tank Farms um it'd be waste from old cleanup sites like the solid waste and operations sites um trying to think of some other examples um chemicals or not radioactive so it's chemicals that you're be it's radioactive but that's not what they regulate right what they don't regulate the radioactive part they regulate the stuff that's with the radioactive okay thank you for your question appreciate that yes uh so if it's taken 12 years for the Rev n review to come out when is R 10 I that kind of half joking but you know looking at the schedule if every 10 years has to be renewed that from the date when it is officially reviewed and approved by ecy or is it the submitt what's that time frame so um I appreciate that question um in 2024 will go out for a public review again it will be 120-day public comment period um and then we will need to address comments we will need to update documents so um let me back up a little bit we will continue to maintain HC at the same time so HC will continue to uh be maintained as the final permit that the permites are working toward we will have the revision 9A out for public review and then once it's it goes out for public review we receive the comments we update the documents then we will issue that permit once the permit becomes effective then it will be 10 years after that is that 120 days for review set in your rules no the choice by apology it's not set in the rules we wanted to provide enough time the our estimate so okay if I say the estimate Stephanie how many pages the site white is care because we're still we're still sorting through the amount of documents it should be about 20,000 Pages which is 120 days meaning that's not much time for the public to get through 20,000 Pages just the requirement actually is just 45 days oh my so a college greatly expanded on that and that's why we're uh working on a robust communication plan ran workshops and have to educate the public on what's going to go out the comment and we'll also do Regional hearings throughout the the state yeah I appreciate that St and that's where my comment kind of came from is are you mandated by rule no so you do 100 could you do more if somebody said hey this is just so much material it's so important we need more than that time if if somebody if somebody requested an extension we would um we would entertain it we would definitely look at it to see yes if we need to give it more time absolutely thank a really nerdy question but those 20,000 pages is that going to be like a 20,000 page PDF or is it going to be something machine readable which we could write code to like stand here to look fors of interest so it will be a web page that you could look at on the ecology website that will have links to each of the unit groups and each of the documents within the unit group so kind of like if you look at HC now it's divided up that way so it wouldn't be like one PDF awesome thank you I think Stephen just volunteered to uh review it will it be red lines like some permit mods are with the changes or is it just all going to look like completely new it completely we do have the redline text from um the so when we put up the Rev n renewal we did maintain the redline text um when the permites provided supplemental information and so we do have that in our administrative record but it won't be what presents to the public okay is that in a machine format it's it's not a machine readable format is that what you're asking is that a is that part is the Redlin part in the machine readable format or um I guess I'd have to know what that is I what do you mean byr PDF uh so the opposite of OCR PDF um or like an act structured document that you could then write a program to find to extract the parts that were actually changed that were actually changed without scroll through 20,000 pages to look for the red lines or open it in word and click next change next change next change yeah it won't be be like that we as far as looking at like the administrative record you could look at the red line and yes it it would be like that where you could look at the next changes you know we're also incorporating a technical fact sheet with each of the unit groups that will um you know the the intent is to explain everything that has changed since the rep n renewal all right so I'll I'll go on but if you all still have questions just don't have to hesitate to ask so um talking a little bit about research development and demonstration permits c a question online oh yeah can you define what a unit is or unit group a unit group so a unit group um it's it's the way we have the permit organized by um the particular facility site um that's being managed under Rec that's a great question it makes me go back and look at what our definition is in the standard TR conditions so was that the question online okay super super thank you so ecology May issue an RD and permit to a facility that proposes to use an Innovative or um and experimental dangerous waste technology or process and that's defined in wack 17333 809 draft Rd and permits follow 840 regular ations in which ecology leads the public comit period so the permites provide a draft permit application to ecology and we draft permit conditions and draft the permit and provide it for a 45-day public comment period and usually yet public hearing is you know involved as well the operation of an RD and facility is limited to one year so it's a short permit so we have two um Rd and permits that we're working on and you've probably heard of both of these I would imagine your discussions um the test bed initiative the test bed initiative phase two project Rd and permit the purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of pre-treating liquid tank waste using an intank column we receiv received the formal permit application in June of this year and the 45-day public comment period will begin early spring so currently preparing the permit for review the new con Rd and permit the purpose of the newon project Rd and permit is to evaluate the effectiveness of particular control technology and reducing Target tank Vapor constituents and air emissions from the Hampford tanks we received the permit application just recently September 28th of this year and we're responding to the permit application and the public comment period is scheduled for early 2024 so um just moving on to some of the folks that we work with on permits um within ecology we have an oversight program hazardous waste toxics Reduction Program in permitting we work with them closely um they make sure we meet our commitments with EPA and permitting um we go to them for guidance and Direction they write our permitting guidance 9542 which again you can find on the ecology website um they maintain our memorandum of understanding with EPA so we appreciate hr's involvement and our permits and um and definitely their advice that they give us I talked a little bit before about um working with EPA region 10 so I won't go through through that again but I I'll just say that we do provide um to EPA region 10 uh permit renewals permit modifications for review and um they help us with permit condition development so um we appreciate their involvement and definitely the advice and Direction they give to us we also work with the Attorney General's office who provide legal advice to us in permitting issues and decisions so lastly I'll talk about non-h handford permits that we manage um the first is perix which is actually being",

council for adoption by the end of the year a pilot project for sewer system monitoring will begin in the upcoming if the pilot is successful a network of streaming sensors will be installed in the system this will provide real-time characteristics of Wastewater to detect unusual pollutants discharged into the system and to ensure the most appropriate treatment options are an inventory of trees and parks is planned for fiscal year 2024 to provide information about species condition and health of trees and high-use parks based on health Tree ratings treason Parks could be more closely monitored and managed including those that are in poor condition and those that are susceptible to pests the current tree inventory has over 38 000 asset points primarily collecting Street tree data in the city's rights of way this effort would add more Park Streets to the a number of large maintenance and repair projects at Willow Lake are included in the proposed budget repairing and recoating of concrete tanks and replacement of mechanisms and four clarifiers is anticipated clarifiers help separate and collect sludge and other components that need to be removed from Wastewater two digesters will have repairs performed on the roofs and inside the tanks digesters collect and help break down the sludge which produces methane biogas and Powers the co-generation facility which helps power the plant also included is a paved biosolid storage facility to increased storage capacity for periods during the year when biosolids cannot be applied to fields and with that staff are available for great thank you so I do have to say that counselor Hoy and counselor Gwen and I and my kiddos we all got the chance to go out and take a tour of Willow Lake that place is amazing it is amazing I think the three of us just kind of um you went at a separate time but I was going to go with you but got sick kids and so then we went together and we just kind of stood there and just kind of shook your head it's amazing to see what is there and I say this often as being a city councilor you don't understand what makes the city tick and tell you really get to go on these tours of facilities like this and realize just how much is going on under our feet and close by so it's amazing yes any of you who are interested in touring any of our facilities let us know and we will be happy to accommodate you and do take him up on it it's really quite amazing any questions I know I'm going to have there's a lot of good stuff in this one again I know every time I read it I thought of different counselors who are I know counselor Varney I know some of this stuff is really um important to you and things that you're working on um I am yes remember Cohen thank you chair I have a series of questions so I'll just take it one by one um is the Willow Lake Center is that owned and operated by City of Salem yes so it's owned and operated by City of Salem and I saw on page 83 that um it serves Salem Turner Kaiser and unurbanized areas of East Salem are those uh cities in unurbanized areas of East Salem pain into the operation of Willow Lake through utility fees and is that shown within our our budget that transfer of funds Brian coming up thank you Ryan good evening everyone Brian martinek and Public Works director yes they do pay in they pay rates just like every other user of that facility is it is it reflected in the budget uh it doesn't show them separately they're they're just uh yeah it's all combined into one only three can be on at the same time sure there we go uh first night technical issues um thank you for the answer uh second question I have is on the Salem tree canopy I saw that we have a goal to attain 28 of the canopy by 2030. how are we doing considering the trees that were damaged in February 21 I did see also an update that uh through 2022 we've replanted some a decent amount of trees so just want to see what we're doing status wise with the replanting the trees I think mylan's here in Milan while you're answering this one could you also answer mine which is about the emerald ash borer kind of where are we at on that process as well uh Milan Davis Urban Forester I don't I'm not involved as much with the canopy but I can talk to you about questions related to how many trees we planted from the ice storm we lost about a thousand trees in our city streets from the ice storm and we actually got funding that Council approved last year to hire for limited duration staff and as of six months into the the program we've already sort of achieved most of our goals of replanting trees we've already replanted the trees we lost a thousand trees and ground a thousand stumps and so we'll continue planting more trees as this next year comes along and part of that is establishment period of watering the trees as well so yeah and emerald ash borer just an him or dashboard was detected in Oregon this year coming from Michigan and the start of the 1990s it's a pest that damages ash trees to a 99 mortality rate to affects the vascular system of the trees and basically within two years time the trees will die so we'll we have quite a large population of Native Ash that will be concerned about in Salem about 1500 Street trees will be affected by that so we're creating a management plan currently it's not expected to show up in Salem and for another five years probably but we're working closely with odf and Oda we're meeting with odf like weekly trying to figure out you know sort of a management plan next steps we'll probably do a lot of remove and replace because like like I said a 99 mortality rate when it comes it's going to come and it's going to affect every ash tree and town and if we do want to save ash trees it'll be you know a time period that we can manage through injections of of herbicide that that can retain some of our canopy if we don't want to lose all of our Ash canopy if we have important Ash canopy and some of the some of the streets with larger trees that we want to maintain some of those for a few years we can do that through some easy injections that will save be cheaper than removing the tree so we hope to come forward to to my management team and and then to you guys eventually with with some of those ideas on on how to manage that but good news is a lot of funding recently from the federal government that odf is going to be able to access to help us with a lot of that so we'll let you guys know about that and as far as the canopy goes I don't know if someone from the climate action team can talk to that and just to be clear odf is the Oregon Department of Forestry correct yes thank uh Brian Martin to get what I wanted to point out was we do have a tree planting programs it's in the capital budget so it's not necessarily reflected in this this work area but we'll be getting to that next week and um we have a three hundred thousand dollar investment in planting trees out of the storm water fund so we are planting trees I I don't know that I have the numbers as far as how much we're gaining in canopy each year especially with the trees we plant are smaller and it takes more time for them to grow and actually expand but we could certainly get more information on that for you for the Supply to Josh and provide it next week great thank you did you have any more questions yes I had one more question thank you chair and I'll save my other tree question for next week um I saw in here and I I'm super excited about it and I was hoping to hear some more information on Oregon's first Community micro grid is there a status update on that I think we have some staff here I see Ellen moving Alan good evening Alan Dan and acting city uh the community microgrid project for those who don't know is uh a grant award that we won from the Oregon Department of energy where we're partnered with PGE and it'll fund battery storage at a facility near their substation on Oxford Avenue near 22nd and that storage will power a feeder that goes up 23rd to our new Public Works operations building that work will get started probably later this year excuse me kind of hard to breathe we just got the grand agreement from odoe and uh we'll be bringing it to the city manager for signing and then the work should get going with design and then construction later this year early next year and Allen the odoe sorry Oregon Department of energy great thank you that is a really exciting program uh that we have them that's really great any other questions member Phillips yeah this is a kind of a comment question to highlight and also just to make sure I'm keeping my bearings about me so at the beginning of this uh manager Keith Staley you had a preamble that kind of highlighted some of the big things and one of those is the adoption of an increase to our operational fee and we saw some ft's attached to that are any of those ft's in this part of the budget like is the park rangers under this or is it under a future section Josh could you help with that question they were reviewed in the previous action welcome local community so none of those positions are in this result but they were on the one that we discussed earlier tonight the first one yeah are all of those in that uh four SOS members uh two code enforcement officers and two Park Rangers AA positions were in last the last results area okay so I guess I'm just late but uh I still want to highlight it I think it's really important and exciting that we're adding things like to uh or looking at potentially adding two essential things like Park Rangers uh it's my understanding that prior to this potential expansion we've only we only have one is that accurate that is that's correct and we have 92 Parks 91 yeah 91 in the low 90s yes okay so I think it's it's about time uh to expand that um and I I think on our scoring you know the parks are pretty high up there so uh I'm I'm excited by",

        "text": " participating landowner was not interest was interested in keeping their land in conservation easement and not falling in um the council cannot force them to do so so your account your approval does not do that um there are of course certain facilities that have uh the ability to um condemn land if they can prove that it's a public need and it's needed for public leading public convenience and necessity um that is a process that is governed by the uc um and we just want to say that the council approval also does not provide any conclusive evidence that that that condemnation is justified if you would consider the council's approval in their determination on whether or not a facility is needed for uh public convenience but uh but it's not i'm just saying so your approval does not allow something to be built online for the conservationism um i think the second point i just like to make about this and then i hope to hear the council's last two is that um this is one issue in a kind of cluster of comments about um way that impacts to protected areas that are designated for their ecological values are considered right now uh the council's rules are really designed around impacts to human users of protected areas and nazi ecological values and so i think we had some comments earlier that there needed to be some clarification about how protected areas standard and habitat wildlife fish and wildlife habitat standard and run into nature species standard all work um that is something that we will continue to evaluate in the future while making um and i think the consideration of conservation easements in and evaluation under the habitat this wildlife habitat may also be an issue that's appropriate to consider in that kind of so again a lot of words say we're not posing any changes here um but this is i think being an important issue city common i'm just um our mantras have been considered in this sphere of you know uh versus economic uh conservationism thank you councilmember condon um yes i it's not it's not identical but i do believe most land trusts hold their land under conservation so they would enter into you know a state or federal plan um in some cases not all one other comment that they bring that up is that there is also the state natural areas and through that um land trust or private landowners can dedicate or register their land as a state natural area if it meets the conservation roles in the state natural areas planned and state natural areas are in protected areas so uh for example the nature conservancy is has many many lands that are conspiracy natural areas there's also you know some newly benefited product plants thank you madam chair this is hanley my concern with uh recognition of conservation easements is that they can be in a lot of different forms and have a lot of different stipulations and i guess i would encourage private landowners or ngos that feel that their areas are worthy of protection to go through the state or local designation process and then that way there's assurance that they meet the standards for a protected thank you for that emma head nodding here yes thank you cat spiders um so uh another comment that we received from the columbia river gorge commission requested or recommended that the columbia river gorge commission be added to the list of reviewing agencies um we're not recommending that the council go forward with that change um in part because the commission is kind of a unique public body that's not really a state of federal agency that's one of the things that the commerce brought up um but more importantly um you know most energy facilities are not in the immediate vicinity of the columbia um gorge natural scenic national scenic area which is uh kind of the concern that was brought up in this comment we do want to point out that when we do employment as we're implementing this new public noticing procedures where we would notice the agency organization which are jurisdiction over a protected we do we would expect that the commission would be included in that noticing if the project was located within um then you know 20 miles or whatever the analysis area is international student again um so we we would would be providing notice um and i think it may depend on some of the the legal structure of the commission but there might be also the opportunity for them to be appointed as a reviewing agency if there is a particularly impactful civil age president for the smarty so do you believe the commoners do they feel like they're just not involved they're not formally making them with a formality thing i will say that this particular comment was provided through the portal and there wasn't a lot of context uh it just kind of gave some background um their mandate to manage scenic resources in the door and that they didn't want to be involved i think if there was a was the review of the facility thank you several commoners recommended that the council remove this is kind of paraphrasing but remove the provision in section three of the protector is that provision allows um the council to make to approve a facility or find compliance with the center without not final approving facility without making findings of compliance with the standard if it's a linear facility that is proposed to be located uh within or adjacent to an existing corridor and the criteria for what that means is slightly different for transmission lines and pipelines we did not discuss that section at all during the informal stages so we're not i'm not comfortable really making a strong recommendation on the merits of that now um but we do not recommend making a change for that i will say that those provisions appear to be related uh to the underlying statute in rs 469 300 the language is the same but that that's actually says basically a transmission line is not if it even if it meets the criteria to be an energy facility it would be accepted uh if it's within an existing utility orders or so you can propose a new transmission line in that border without having to go through the scientific process um there's some similar language in the statute for local approval and transmission lines and i think this is related but i think we'd have to do more research to say if if that section in the protected area is standard actually has substantive i think there's some local provision to almost support putting transmission corners and existing partners so it makes sense to carry that vision through well that that is all i have prepared for you now if there were other comments that you all would like to discuss now um as i said i've read through them all haven't prepared what i could i uh he didn't break can you just do a little preview of some of the other comments that were you know we're essentially going to defer not that you get into them and analyze them but if there is some level that you can kind of preview for council members today secretary yes uh so thinking through uh the significant comments um there's a lot of discussion of uh just how the protected areas definition is written and how we've incorporated legal citations and there seems to be some disagreement between stakeholders on whether the legal citations are uh helping or not and so i think we'd like us to take a better look at that with fresh eyes um there was a number of comments from irene gilbert um kind of making some specific recommendations including uh considering research forests aside from just the research forests that are owned and operated by osu we think it is probably we're taking another look at that especially in light of the establishment of the new elliott state research forest um there was a comment to add um state scenic byways to the protected area standard and i do want to know that our proposed change would incorporate those into formally incorporate those into the scenic resources standard but there may be some merits and looking at that a little bit more closely you know we did get the comments about fiscal impact statement and particularly the small business analysis included in this full impact statement were raised again um i think that probably needs some legal review um i will say i'm still confident in our analysis but that's just me so um that will be uh i i'd like to have that kind of formally reviewed as well before we make uh formal statements i think that's it there there is probably more and i actually i'm certain there's much more that i'm not thinking right now thank you for that searching well then um so since we are going to fold over and continue this at a later date i don't think i'll be stated at this time so thank you for getting us through that as necessarily appreciate your efforts can't wait to i'm sure you can't wait to help find some of this off late uh i'm excited to have another policy walk in the shop thank you well our next item's public comment but before we do this side of the room this table we are freezing over which is the public comment period this is an information item this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item in council jurisdiction that is not otherwise otherwise closed for comment items closed for comment through the board and hemingway transmission line post order and proposed contest case border the nolan hills windpower project wrapped proposed order and proposed order and this mccarty generating station for the western amendment three rounds order and support so uh with that said i will look over uh across the room and ask uh fancy to sarah whoever has got the cards and went and then we've got anybody on the line so i'm gonna defer to y'all that's going to help out here you can do that you know you're here i'm here again um my name is irene gilbert welcome we've got a couple of new members so welcome to them and um i didn't i guess when i started thinking about what i would comment on today i was kind of curious about what kind of people like dan are getting when they come to work in this very important job of functioning on the energy facility siding council so um i went to the computer i've been described as a little old lady with a computer so i guess you know that kind of certainly is bad um and anyway when i looked up what the leading department of energy's role is with um why they're here uh basically what the what i came up with is that their job is to incentivize and support uh the development of renewable energy and that they collect data and keep information regarding uh renewable you know that that kind of goes along with the idea that the photo staff for instance are paid by the developers and you know all of their actions are are billed to the developers and and pay for for all the work that they",

And there'll be real time tracking of what they're expensing, which also gives HUD the timesheets that they want to say, yes, you did the work on our grant that you said you were going to do. So there's that a lot of the time in splitting invoices and having enough budget in accounts. That's a big part of the internal conflict that we've had. So budget ends up having to do a budget amendment. Finance can't approve something. Procurement's trying have to split it. There's a lot of internal time that's lost and that's not eligible for recovery under the admin camp because those are indirect cost. So there's additional costs outside of Cheryl's department that we're not recovering. So in this method, that time won't be lost in those departments anymore. And then the dollars can be recovered, recapture more of the admin money through the salaries. I hope that helps in my. Yeah, no, it's really good. Thank you. You're most welcome. Any other questions? Yeah, we need anything else? Thank you. Yeah, I think Mister Minter was going to bring us something back, if necessary today. Because we did adjourn until today for the 130 meeting. Yeah, well, my understanding is it's been determined that the contract had a 90 day closing provision after all. So at least as of today, there's no action needed today. We still need to figure out if they're actually going to be able to get the work done even within that period. But there's no urgency for today at a minimum. However, since we're all here, we do have another issue that maybe Tracy can elaborate on for this. For our Silver Springs Shores project, we have a mobile home in the county right of way. Chapmire, rather chatmire. We have a mobile home in our right of way that's keeping the contractor from doing some of the work that needs to be done. In the right of way. How in the heck did it get. Is it. Oh, come on. That's pretty easy to happen. But it. In the right of way? Yeah. In the right of way is where I'm like, is it something that's been there for a long time? Yeah, apparently so. Nobody. Nobody's in it. Okay. All right, good. But it would be nice if we could just go out and put a tag on it and then two days later go out and remove it. But we can't. We actually have to go to court and get an injunction or writ of ejectment to do that. And so rather than waiting until the next board meeting, if you want to authorize us to look into that and because we need to deal with the situation, you just need consensus for that, and then you can bring official. Right? Yeah, okay, I'm good. Me too. Let's move it as quickly along as we can. Set a gravel truck out of. It's not very hard. Does busy bee having any gravel. We do, we know has another suggestion. I mean, it's litter. Don't worry. Commercial curry. I'll take care of this. In the right way. There we go. Yeah. Commercial dumping. All right, we'll proceed with putting together whatever we need to put together to deal with the situation. Thank you. Continuing this on till today. Wasn't totally alive. And then notify the owner. No, they have to go to court and get an injunction. Unless. Move it. Unless the owner comes and takes it out of the right of way. The owner has. The owner has said no, that's my property. So now there's a dispute. But you're in the right of way, mister owner. Also, you're gonna need an induction. We'll let him explain it to the judge. No one's living in it. Okay, well, that's good. Is there electricity running to it or anything? There was. How in the world. It's not hard. I'm just saying, because it's in the right. Hard there, though, I guess. Well, because a lot of times, almost all of those roads there, just like ours out in Fort McCoy, are, you know, they're just, they were just easements. Yeah. You know, and so, well, it's. Someone was like, oh, that's still, that's still my property. And they think it's an easement, a dedicated Eastman. I mean, half the roads are like that all out there. So actually, on that point, I mean, one of the things that, one of the things we for sure have to be able to prove to the satisfaction of the court is that it truly is in our right of way. So I was looking at an old 1935 Florida supreme court case involving Marion county. Really? And the Florida Supreme Court acknowledged that the county had the right to remove stuff like that from the right of way. But in that case, the county couldn't prove that it actually was the county's right of way. So that is something we'll have to make sure we can show to the court. Well, I'm pretty sure that there, I mean, we know it's in our right of way because the utility company is doing all the surveying and all of that, correct? Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Is that. I mean, I'm assuming that's all platted. Well, there, right? Or. No, it is flattened, isn't it? It's platted.

        "text": " best to answer those those questions kind of who who are the the folks and organizations that will be affected by the rules and kind of what the committee's done to try to make that um impact uh kind of minimize the any adverse potential adverse impacts yeah thanks Wendy so the other one area I wanted to highlight to in the draft Charter just in general you know guidelines for our meetings please pleas prepare for set aside time for meetings um if there's any research or documentation that you want to bring toward the rack please provide it you know happy to happy to provide that to the rest of the committee if if it's sent to us um we're going to you know try our best definitely to stay focused on the specific topics for each meeting and then just general please comment constructively treat everybody with respect um allow one person to speak at a time act courteously as we go through our process we have right now in our draft uh schedule that I'll show here in a couple minutes uh seven specific meetings for the rulem advisory committee that are set out but I do want to talk about and uh get your input on our proposed schedule and how we how we plan to to go about our work through the rest of the year um and then again we're just we are trying to at this point um limit rack meeting meetings to Rack members and alternates only with the plan for having broad stakeholder meetings that follow rack meetings to cover anything that was discussed in the rack meeting and bring that for broader stakeholder input so um I do ask so everyone should be able to access the draft Charter uh please get in there review that provide any comments and Track Changes by the end of next week if that sounds reasonable uh by by March 1 if are there any potential issues with providing that comments back by the end of next week kind of seen General General head nods that that looks okay so um and I'll send an email out after this just to uh yeah yeah sorry um just two things I just put in the chat that it looks like the version you sent out has us only meeting four times so just not sure if there are other changes that have been made to ver yeah yeah thanks for for highlighting that I did just change that that was the only thing that I changed in between the two the two versions and I had it highlighted before just because it was kind of a placeholder as I was putting together the schedule um gotcha I was hesitant to attach a version to a to an email you know because it becomes static at that point um but now please uh like reference the version on on the stakehold on the SharePoint site rather that'll be the live version that we update um okay that's great yeah and yeah apologies for not pointing that out oh gosh no no no no just wanted to make sure there was anything else that had been changed um and then I think the other thing is just I've not served on an Odo rack before is this pretty typical is there anything different about this Charter um for this for this rack that maybe you could flag for us um I will say it's it's my first rack to to be on too um but I did use a couple of uh rack Charters and other agency organization ERS um there was one that I I referenced from DEQ who holds a lot of rule making advisory committees um some of our other sighting um work in citing rulle making advisory committees um at our agency so uh a lot of the language is is pretty common across agency racks um and I tried to use that as much as possible yeah uh Kathleen and sorry if you mentioned this is it okay to share out like within our organization like media notes from here and things that we discuss yes okay great thank you so just yeah request homework for the committee please review by March 1st the draft Charter now I'll talk a little bit about what our plans or I'll make this larger um there you go our plans for our BPS rule structure so we plan to follow the same general structure as standard 100 um if you're familiar with standard 100 it's organized into you know chapters and sections and that is the the general framework that we plan to use for our rule making chapters too this is similar to what the way that it was structured in Washington state and we know moving forward that you know some of the chapters are going to be relatively straightforward in just administrative pieces and largely non-controversial and others are going to be more involved and have a lot more discussion that we'll need to to focus on so we put together a draft oh just here's I'll pull up the draft schedule next but um here's what the what the chapters in standard 100 look like there it starts out just with the the purpose scope definitions for for energy management and building performance standards compliance requirements energy and Emissions plans operations and maintenance requirements and these will essentially become our chapters of our rul making um all the way down to implementation and and just as another example um this is the way that Washington structured their rules too so we we plan to do something very similar so you'll notice that their rulemaking sections are a mirror of the chapters in ashr standard 100 so that's our plan too um just one note that Ash or that Washington based there because it was the most the current version the available version at the time the 2018 version of standard 100 uh we are going to reference because it just came out a month ago and it's available to us now the 2024 version of the standard the biggest difference in the 2024 version is that it now references emissions targets and has a greenhouse gas component to it also although that won't necessarily be a consideration for us because our standards are directed by the statute to be based on site energy so if you look at the 2024 version of standard 100 you'll see all these greenhouse gas emissions related targets those won't be applicable for us that's really the biggest change that came with the new version of the standard but there are some other functional administrative pieces that we'll want to look to Rolling into to the Oregon specific version of it and I think it makes sense just to grab the most recent version of the standard since it's now available um so now I'll pull up what we're looking for for the draft schedule um let's see get there it is so the way that we are proposing to structure our meetings is to have a rack meeting every month to cover certain chapters and certain sections of the rules and then essentially take two months worth of rack meetings so each rack meeting would be limited to Rack members only and then take two months worth of rack meeting input where we as a as an agency provide the rack ahead of the meeting with Draft rules we use the rack as a focused working session to take comments uh feedback like look at the draft rule language and then we'll revise as needed after those meetings and then roll up two months worth of rack meetings and bring those out to the general public for a broad review so where we've got these blue meetings for every month covering certain chapters and this is all all subjects Chang and I'm certainly open to to any input that the rack has at this point on how we structure these but um to take uh like each individual chapter look at those as a rack and then just for example in may we would take what the rack covered in March and April and bring that to a broader public uh input session um and certainly rack members are encouraged and um able to attend the broader public input but that's where we would look to you know anybody and you know any affected stakeholder that wants to provide input on our on our work um and then we take that back and revise it as needed based on the broad public input and repeat that cycle three different times ultimately toward providing our integrated complete rule draft by the end of September filing that by the end of September and then that becomes just the standard state agency formal public rulem process where we file our rules with the Secretary of State our Draft rules leave it open for a month for public comment on the entire package of rules rules hold the public Ru making Hearing in the in early November um and then file our rules by the end of the year so it's all kind of working back from that December 31st file the rules deadline that's in statute and the work that we need to do to get there by that time so this kind of has our rack activity finishing up by the end of August so that we can have that final public broad public meeting in September take comments back file the rules another month of public input as part of the formal rulem process so um hopefully this this kind of makes sense if there's any questions or comments or feedback uh happy to uh Cara yeah you're gonna be sorry you had me on this rack I'm a very active rack participant not sorry at all that's great I uh I I just am thinking about how a lot of the DEQ racks um operate so that rack members are talking to each other and they're the only ones with cameras on and have the only ability to talk but then the general public can watch I don't know I don't know that there will be much appetite for um this particular rack but I could see potentially there being folks who have expertise who of course people who have expertise who aren't on the rack who have who may have a lot to offer and may benefit from watching the rack operate um so I guess just wondering how other folks feel about the sort of hybrid nature of this where we have private rack meetings and then then it sounds like you'll go to the public present sort of what we've done so far they won't actually watch the rack operate um they'll just you'll then bring feedback back to us I guess I just wondered if there we could have a discussion about whether that makes the most sense or if you're pretty sold on that um way of um yeah thanks I think we we did consider yeah a few different uh methods for doing this whether or not we have you know we we you know there's an option for like rack meetings open to the public with public input maybe at the end maybe kind of uh hybrid meetings where we have the rack meet for an hour and then the public directly after that the way that we were envisioning it was that the rack meetings are more focused interactive working",

        "text": " meant by that um and so uh one is to ensure coordination across the state agencies to pursue the funds um many of the federal funds that are uh coming available will be competitive competitive in nature and so Oregon will be competing with other states to try to get these funds and so it's important to try to help uh make sure that the state is putting its best foot forward and um we're thinking that you know ensuring coordination classes agencies would help with that also supporting uh complementary programs regulations and incentives that increase uh the likelihood of receiving and maximizing the use of the funds there are one of the programs the greenhouse gas reduction fund there has been conversation about the distribution mechanism being a green bank or green green Banks throughout the throughout the US and you know Oregon currently doesn't have a green Bank um other states do and so uh doesn't mean that Oregon has to have a green Bank per se but those are that is an example and the commission had recommended and its last planning a report to the legislature that um a green bank would would be a good idea uh for the state to do so that's just an example of a complimentary program that could help uh leverage and get the federal funding and then uh the last one here is to provide opportunities for public input engagement and Outreach particularly uh for foreign with environmental justice communities um there is a a strong push in the federal work as part of the justice 40 initiative to ensure that 40 of uh the dollars are used um to help benefit environmental justice communities and there are also a lot of State uh current state efforts to try to maximize that and make that happen at the state level and so uh making sure that all this is coming together to be able to really maximize the um the use of the funds to provide the benefits to those communities to experience the disproportionate impacts of climate change and also can very much benefit from some of the climate action solutions that are coming so with that um I thought I would stop and see if folks have questions I thought yeah first I'd want to just recognize that there are some additional uh folks representing uh Commissioners or hand Commissioners that have joined um Garrett Martin from the puc is with us today as a stand-in for the puc Suzanne Carlson is uh here representing ODOT and Suzanne has a comment that will give her the floor when I'm done director Benner joined us quite a while ago but I think just after we did the roll call and I believe Judith Collins is back uh you know representing the Department of uh Suzanne Carlson do you want to weigh sure thanks um and Dan off mute all that okay great um thanks Zach this is a lot of a lot of work a lot of information I'm definitely digesting it a little bit if you could go up to recommendation five for a moment I think that's where I primarily had comments some people know that ODOT is pulling together a transportation emissions dashboard it's a lot of work it's taken us many times uh more time than we than we thought it would a lot of coordination across state agencies so I think my caution here is that reporting annually is super often when it really comes down to it by the time you finish one report you're getting ready to do the next one so I think maybe a part of this or maybe a bullet that comes above some of these is look at the coordination tables that happen now and see where you can supplement or aggregate so we've got the there's the bicep and the biannual Energy report those are pretty comprehensive um and those are the kind that as soon as you finish you start again so there's a few different reporting Avenues it will there'd probably be some redundancy into some of us creating an annual report to the Oregon global warming commission that might be captured in some other places so just kind of from an effort level and a duplication level we might just map this a little more thoroughly before committing to it um in as word it's a really good place um Suzanne and um we definitely don't want to do anything that's make work and so I think your idea of let's look at what are the reporting requirements that we already have and then I do those completely satisfy what the commission would need or you know could you add like a cover um an existing report you're doing that would maybe add some of the elements that might be missing but not have to produce two different things or not you know not a full rehash of something that might be well reported so good point and I'd probably add that to the last two about the requirements as well we have other platforms where we're being required to do things so um it might just be looking at what's in great not objected to any of the work just just looking at ways we can make sure it's the same direction direct directives from different places uh Miss Nicole Singh yes I just wanted to kind of also Echo those comments repeat them back because I think in many respects here at the EQ there there's lots of different emissions reporting and there are lots of different tools that we have so you know making sure that we're not duplicating or being efficient as we're thinking through this um I see that um Gabriella you had a question uh maybe also won maybe on recommendation for um and I'm not sure exactly the different what the dividing line is between recommendation three and recommendation for there seems to be a little overlap but for future studies is something that we've talked about and in the note but we've talked about the fact that we don't have comprehensive information about we yeah you didn't get the resources to be able to um have the consultant team really dig in and fully evaluate the co-benefits and we certainly spoke today about not being able to fully capture either the greenhouse gas reduction or cost effectiveness of some actions that currently rank lower so and I just didn't see in the categories of these studies that maybe I'm missing it so Zach that would be great if you can point out whether any of these do address those needs that the commission has discussed yeah thank you um so sub recommendation a uh to be able to um funding to do the biennial uh forecast of emissions is part of that uh so we were thinking that the forecast of admissions is uh the kind of Cornerstone of the then conversation around co-benefits and the like and so um we uh would we were thinking that that would also be um because we would use it every uh four years to do an update of the road map that we would be hopefully getting uh funding from the legislature to be able to do uh that as part of the update of the roadmap and maybe we can be more clear about that in in our description as well as the uh you know you mentioned the dividing line the team recommendation three and and recognition for this sub recommendation C here the third one was also really trying to get at that so that we have um some and that's where we know exactly how to uh best view the co-benefits analysis and there's also new tools that will be available with the environmental environmental justice mapping tool and so the idea was that as we're working through the new actions through the recommended to the Tigger process that we could use that as kind of a a pilot or a way to start to understand how to best view the co-benefits analysis and um frankly the engagement that needs to happen to be able to inform that co-benefits analysis uh for future road maps and so um that's particularly why we uh at the end of this sub recommendation put in informed best practices for future roadmaps with the idea that it may be that we need um dedicate additional dedicated money to be able to do you know specific engagement or get consultant support and alike and hopefully that would come out of some of this experience and conversation around these actions yeah and I think that certainly is great especially in terms of qualitative data that you would get from that kind of Engagement and I don't know what the right um characterization is but if the if the impression is that we need to redo what we did last time we need to update what we did last time but uh in you know some of the committee subcommittee conversations that we had that you were able to kind of explain the pieces or or characterize the pieces that the current study wasn't able to cover and I don't know if that's just okay just expanding scope of work it seemed like it was the nature of the work itself it was it was different than what what these folks were capturing in in the current study but if it's not if it's just we need to I guess maybe it's just flagging the need to expand the scope of work resources commensurate to expand the scope of work to more accurately be able to quantify you know things that that weren't resources to do in the first study if it's just a matter of expanding the yeah good point and the other point I put in the chat was just noticing the recommendation about Workforce in rural areas it it is very acute in rural areas but it's Statewide and so we are grappling at OHA with how we are going to support navigation of people who um are there's going to be a lot of resources coming into the state and there's legislation that um I know rep Marsh and others I think rep fam are spearheading thinking about how to uh make sure and I and I know um repelm also has a bill about a hub to to um the funding that's coming into the state but uh there's a big Workforce piece that needs to be on the agenda to be able to upgrade all those electrical systems and install all those heat pumps and you know on and on so um really want to underscore how important that is other questions or comments Reflections on on the recommendations Zach's explanation if it was the commissioner Jackson that kind of reflect what you were thinking about relative to having a specific education or or do we need to sign a brighter light on it I think you're on mute okay sorry due to audio I have to use your phone as well I still recall that extension one was mine but definitely uh it's an area of Interest as well so this does look good to me the recommendations good thank you Michael or excuse me Senator Deborah do you want to comment on the reporting and how that's addressed in Senate bill uh sure thanks chair yeah I mean let me say first of all um I find this very very helpful this uh the work that's been done",

        "text": " level what the risk is to Public Health into safety we've taken into account the current worker right the person that's actually helping the disposal of the stuff and we also take into account the future worker this really you know just kind of solidifies what's Happening Now right uh in in Oregon a lot of these wastes are being taken into landfills and being disposed and the risk um of these materials when they're in a landfill is much much lower um you know then spreading them on the ground I don't think any forthright person would think it's good to take radioactive or high levels of radiation and spread it on the ground and then live on it that's just not um that just makes good sense so anyway all shown up that answer your question not entirely um I I understand that there is a strong motivation for a workaround but to me right now until I hear what experts have to say it seems to me that the operative word in in that addition to um the definition number 23 for radioactive the operative word is material not the disposal method or where it ends up I mean there's a practical problem I can see that you're trying to solve but I'm I'm just finding finding it difficult to see that the law has currently written would allow that I think that I recall from several meetings back that Jeff burrite pointed out I think it was Jeff anyway that that the law doesn't allow us to talk either back to the oil and gas issue and The Dumping fracking dumping it um the law doesn't allow us to prohibit the origin of the waste so that would also I would imagine be also cover you know waste coming from out of state from a process that we don't engage in here so anyway I'll uh I don't want to dominate this conversation but there's a lot to be to be heard in the future thanks agreed um thanks Shirley this is Max I'll just go in here and yeah to your point there is a a legal review process that we're undertaking right now to your first question about um the the statutory definitions the second question around um Can Oregon limit and prohibit waste from other states um I think our working assumption is also that that's not allowable um that you can't limit uh second interstate commerce clause kind of a thing although we to be honest we probably could look a little closer at that legal issue if that was something of interest to the um there might be some some open questions there but we had asked that question at least a year ago and I think the answer was probably not I had an actual question here uh my own um in addition to what we've been Emily can you talk a little more about the tables A and B distinction and why you settled on the materials on your list right now and how you're proposing uh why you're proposing why but what you're proposing on those material specifics yeah definitely um I just want to say one thing too and I am not a lawyer but I other states do prohibit what comes in from other states so I don't know if that's like Kentucky for example doesn't allow waste from certain States unless they're in their compact so I don't know if that's something that could be it's not the compact because of the low-level radioactive waste compact States is that what they use for their definitions as we we're a member of the low-level radioactive waste compact in the Northwest but that's waste that's even more to be low level radioactive waste is to be more Radioactive to the state of Washington has the Northwest compacts low-level radioactive waste uh landfill anyway one other point before you dive in um just from the from my perspective on on the state agency side we see the more pathway waste that is Oregon generated right now um it's from Oregon businesses and industries that are generating more of this waste that is looking for pathway exemptions right now probably much more than out-of-state waste that we that we look at just for context yes art did you have a comment on the previous thing before I jump into tables A and B you had your oh your hand went down all right okay so table a came from to table it was developed from two places one is a list of which again sorry you got the PDF not the the PowerPoint file all these little numbers correspond to a link where that came from so I didn't invent this list it came from um different states and how different states Define what's not radioactive and what is excluded specifically and what's explicitly called out is being excluded um again that comes from other states definitions uh Ohio Kentucky uh Montana Colorado and north dakota being the key ones there additionally some of these things come from the EPA and additionally some of these things come from a report by the crcpd which is the conference on radiation control program directors it's a heck of an acronym and so essentially that's that's a loose group of State Regulators that get together to talk about issues like this right that come up and that are common to States um every state is sort of in this weird place with teen or just because the EPA hasn't stepped in to regulate it at a federal level different states have done different things and one of the things these are things we found in common that different states did that they excluded these things a couple of the others cement dust and the um coal combustion and the uh one of these others that I'm missing is came from um different uh peer-reviewed or peer of published studies that showed that the radioactive that the Tenon concentrations in those materials are quite low and are generally not of concern so when you look at all different types of cement cement across a variety of different locations you know is that something you need to worry about and the answer was no and there's published papers on that same thing with the wastewater treatment plant and the coal combustion products those again came from someone did a study some some poor soul went and did a bunch of Wastewater studies and published all of that um data and did a risk and dose assessment on that material and said yeah it's not a concern so we can rely on the work that other people have done other states have done other federal agencies have done and other peer-reviewed uh information that's been published to come up with this list so that is I mean that's essentially the process I use to come up with this a couple of these the sandblasting waste those came from directly from data uh that uh the chemical waste Management landfill has looked at so they had 20 plus different types of sandblasting waste that had been tested at PACE Labs you know in a certified lab where they um they did a gamma spec on it and all of those are you know less than way less than for the most part less than one Pico carry per gram radium 226. so rather than continuing to test every single sandblast material that comes in we have a pretty good set of data that says yeah that stuff's all quite low so we're pretty safe um so that's essentially where this came from and again I'll provide you all the references so you can go you guys can go look and then we can have a more informed conversation about all of this but essentially that left this stuff as being stuff we know as teen arm it's not necessarily low however we Define low in in teen on concentration so it's stuff we need to think about um bag house dusts are an obvious one where we see those in our path every pathway exemption we've done right has probably a lot of them anyway have bag house dust so those are not necessarily low so we wouldn't want to exclude those um and same thing with pipe scale scale is one of the things that comes out of the oil and gas industry where we really know that's definitely concentrated the radioactive material and it's definitely something we need to think about filter socks I think are what started this whole problem in Oregon to begin with way back in I don't know several years ago now right where um Phil it was mostly filter shocks that were disposed of um and that's not unique to Oregon either right this Kentucky had the same thing happen where they took a bunch of filter socks um and the filter socks again are the it's like a filter that goes on the end of a pipe and it literally looks kind of like a sock um and that can that concentrates radioactive material so these are things that we know we should be concerned about and as for the stuff that's not on these two lists because again these clearly don't Define every waste stream that goes into an organ landfill those are things where we have to make some informed judgments and we'll work we'll have to figure that out um and and it just who knew trash was so complicated right I just throw it out in my trash can and it goes to the curb and I don't think about it again um so I realize that there's nuances here that um that Hillary has pointed to and we've talked about with you guys fairly extensively that we're gonna have to think about but that was the General rationale for getting a and b tables A and B okay thank you it sounds like a basis of existing scientific studies and knowledge base from your own from your work plus a couple local examples of product that maybe have come through the waste management system in particular okay yeah yep exactly for go to the of the team's knowledge here um on the coal combustion residuals we a couple years ago when the Boardman coal plant was being uh shut down um our team worked with Portland General Electric and verified that the uh the ash pile that is going to sit at the Boardman coal plant site in perpetuity is not radioactive waste it was tested and scanned for radioactivity and it was below the um even the five Peaks per gram threshold as I recalled it was quite low but we did test it and we did check on it because it was known that that product can have radioactivity levels that are depending on the origin of the material so we've done that Cecilia go ahead I think we're probably getting closer yeah yeah we got about 20 minutes left on the uh the meeting so um just wanted to speak to a couple things uh Jim had mentioned that um this proposal was is about the same as what we're doing now with pathway exemptions and I would say yes but on um right now the path most of the pathway exempt waste is going to a landfill but under our rules if the generator of those pathway exempt wastes could legally dispose of the waste otherwise by land spreading or the like if DEQ",

        "text": " it's a screen grab of a document that is available on website our our project and our sighting facilities website and it's basically a one-page document that helps explain the relationship between what the application is required to contain which is the division 21 and how it relates to the council standards and rule as you will see in this example that there are several of these exhibits that cross over multiple standards and rules for example the one at the top is materials analysis it links to the general standards of review but it also is tied to the soil protection standard and so for each of application requirements these exhibits are intended and required to demonstrate how the project and how the applicant will meet the requirements of the standard or the rule so the magnitude of what an applicant actually has to provide um to document that they have met the burden of proof for each of these standards varies based upon the type of energy facility and the location of the project next slide so the draft proposed order the draft proposed order is where odo makes findings of fact conclusions of and recommendations for conditions to fsac on each council standard and we incorporate and evaluate the reviewing agency comments and and then we notice another public notice will go out and we will issue the draft proposed order and we call it the dpo for short and based upon that process once it is issued another round of public participation is initiated and this is when formal public comment is open there's a hearing associated with this phase and that will allow you to comment on whether or not you think staff's initial recommendations are are adequate or and the hearing officer conducts a public hearing on the draft proposed order where members of the public and reviewing agencies have the opportunity to testify at the hearing you can also submit comments in writing by a comment deadline that's established at the hearing next slide i wanted to emphasize in this slide the public participation at the dpo phase the dpo notice will initiate the opportunity for public comment on the proposed facility and notice opens the comment period and provides the details on the next on the public hearing and the public may submit comments by our new online portal which i'll talk about in a minute by mail you can email you can hand deliver you can fax you can put them in that post office put a stamp on it and you can also participate in written oral comments at the actual dpo public hearing it's important to emphasize that anyone want who wants to participate beyond this point in the process must raise an issue either in person or in the public or by submitting a written comment to before the deadline given in the notice failure to raise a relevant issue either orally at the hearing or in a timely submitted written comment precludes further participation in the fsac process next slide so we have a new online portal for submitting comments this will be open for this project once the dpo is issued and the formal commenting period is open and that link in this slide is is an active link and it will take you to the next slide show you what it looks like you want to go to the next slide and this is the this is a screenshot of the portal and if you go up to that public comments tab at the top of the page it will open a drop down menu and that drop-down menu you'll go to the bottom that says citing and when you click on that it'll take you to a a very user-friendly website where you can pick your project make your comment and submit it through the online portal one more way to participate next slide so for public participation at the dpo it's important to emphasize that persons who are interested in being considered for party status in a contested case will need to meet two criteria and that's part of the purpose of what is on the content in this slide so the first the first criteria relates to to be eligible to participate in a contested case on this application a person must raise an issue either in person or at the dpo public hearing or in a written comment submitted between the start of the dpo comment period and before the record closes at the conclusion of the hearing council will not accept comments after it closes the record the second criteria relates to the of your comments for consideration in a contested case issues must be raised issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction and it must be raised with sufficient specificity so that the council the department and the applicant understand the issue raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue i'll get into this a little bit more in the next slide so this slide basically gives you uh kind of a side by side example of what we would consider to be effective comments and comments that may be less effective in the sense that they they don't provide us an opportunity to relate it to our process in our state so all comments need to be submitted in a timely fashion and they will be reviewed by odo and the besides providing commenters with the opportunity to be eligible to be considered for party status in the consist contested case proceeding timely and specific comments that point out issues with the application or the draft proposed order provide odo the opportunity to address these issues when we develop the next document in the process the proposed order the left-hand column of this slide provides examples of the types of comments that help us improve our the right hand column shows the types of comments we will read but that are less likely to help us improve our analysis of whether or not the facility complies with council standards because this is a standards-based process comments that reference specific council standards and provide specific information supporting whether or not a standard has been met are more likely to improve our analysis than statements of support or opposition to the facility so effective comments we're saying reference specific signing standards provide specific information supporting whether or not you believe a standard has been met state supporting facts in comments and attaching reference materials and referencing specific pages or sections of the application or the dpo in your comments so those are what we would call and you can read the other ones for less effective but it's basically stating that you know you support or oppose the copy of a report without really indicating that any analysis or facts related to a specific standard or compliance with that standard raising issues that are outside our council's jurisdictions or making statements that are just simply unsubstantiated by any evidence the next slide as i've noted before this is kind of an overview of our and we are at this phase right here we're doing the public outreach public meeting on the complete application we are embarking on the draft proposed order where it's under review we're writing it now when it's issued it will go out for public comment and additional agency coordination there will be another public noticing at that point so we're at a public meeting and while we're doing a q a there is no public comment period associated with this informational meeting step if you're someone who is interested in formal comment and public comment on this proposed facility i want to emphasize that that happens at the draft proposed order phase when the draft proposed order is issued goes out in public notice again you will have an opportunity to submit those comments i'm going to go over a couple more that just have um some screenshots and some useful links that are embedded in these slides so if you go and pull this presentation off our website these links are active and they will um this is the next slide is going to be an slide of our fsec facilities um web map this is the the opening page to our our facilities or citing under the odo webpage all of our projects are listed project that any facility that has a site certificate um a proposal an application a termination an amendment it will all be an operational facility it's all listed here on this main webpage and this is one way to find project in any other project that we there's also an interactive map there next slide this is the project page and so if you received a public notice for this meeting or you saw it in the it had a link embedded in it that would take you to the nolan hills win project this is on our odo website it has several links that are active in there the complete application and all the exhibits are available

        "text": " bit about uh coming up here the the large uh building up on Oregon Street and you know the city of Sherwood does not deliver that building we are part of the process but we have to have the private sector you know being interested in in Sherwood and we make sure that if they want to come here we provide the opportunity um and and to that point uh the quality of life in Sherwood the mayor just went over a you know our summary really high quality of life here in Sherwood um companies know that uh developers know that and so part of what we do is maintain that high quality of life and that's an incentive for these businesses to come here so in addition to just getting them the permits all the things that the mayor just mentioned the trails the the bridge uh the park space all of that is is also Economic Development it's livability it's it's the quality of life for all of you of course but it's also you know if if a company is choosing between this city and that City and the land value is the same and everything else they are going to want to come to Sherwood because they know that they're they can attract employees and talent uh to their company as well so maintaining that high quality life is something that we do to attract businesses as well any panelists want to talk into that Tim Maya I'll keep it super short I think uh you know Bruce talked about incentives and I that's important part of the the relook or not relook but looking at our downtown overlay and are there things we can do through SDC offsets and other programs like that to encourage the type of businesses that we'd like to see down there uh which is you know walkable restaurants Boutique shops those types of things and we talk a lot about downtown but we also have a wider area that we we also looking at addressing as well very good thank you so my year work with uh the senior citizens of Sherwood so tell us a little bit about that what are we doing for older citizens meal programs Tim talked a lot about it but but from your perspective how can we help sure so what Sherwood is doing for the older adults in the city is one of the things that I'm proudest of um in my life in in working with and being with the city not only do we have the margerie Stewart Senior Community Center where our mayor mentioned that we cook fresh cooked meals Monday through Friday so we have a chef that's cooking fresh vegetables fresh proteins something different every single day for everybody who's there we we have the mental health programs to support our community um and their mental health we have socialization programs classes we we cater to all Realms of Wellness at the margerie Stewart Senior Center we have a new Transportation program the Sherwood senior shuttle that does curb to curb pickup and drop off for our older adults in the Sherwood area that's a new program it just started I'm very proud um but we also above that we have just finished up an ADA uh survey of the city to make sure that the city C is doing what we need to do to make um our buildings and Parks accessible to people we have as as again the mayor mentioned the senior Advisory board that is working to survey and make sure that we are meeting the needs of our older adults in many different Realms and of course we have our new um age friendly City designation we received that in October and what that means is that the city of Sherwood is really um prioritizing the livings and living working and um accessibility for people from day one to the last day whatever that looks like and so we are looking at polling our community finding out individual needs right now we finished a year-long survey and we learned that we need to really focus on Transportation housing and sociability so that's what we're really working on strengthening in the city today how you can help is volunteer wonderful join our Advisory Board participate in our surveys surveys come talk to us and tell us what you need and what you're seeing in the community how do you gather your surveys um we do it various different ways we have in-person surveys at the center you can call the center and we can do those surveys over the phone and of course we have those surveys available by email over the last year you would saw a little blurb at the bottom of your water bill uh saying please fill out this survey um so you'll see that again but if you're ever just curious about what's available or how you can help please give us a call at the margerie Stewart Senior Center or email me and uh we'll get back to you and see what we can do about that very good any the panelists want to speak into that good okay next question the pedestrian bridge cost a lot of money a lot how is that being paid for can you describe um Tiff and other things on mechanisms to pay for that bridge it yeah it drives me nuts how much uh construction costs um well you might not be aware of just talking about construction costs for as long as I can remember especially for government projects the inflation rate for construction costs has been averaging about 7% a year and it's one of the reasons we're so focused on getting things done quickly you know just on the pedestrian bridge I used to talk to the city manager all the time every month we delay is another couple hundred, when you just think about uh construction costs it's a lot of money but keep in mind when we originally were talking about that bridge it was just going to cross 99 so it maybe 200 feet and um we really hadn't fully baked the idea so one of the reasons that you know some of the original estimates for just construction not um contingencies land acquisition engineering all that kind of stuff we're around that you know 12 to 14 million but once you lengthen the bridge once you deal with the amount of time it took to get there and increases in costs that's how we got to these final numbers around I think Allin assuming we don't use contingency we'll probably be around 27 um 27 million it's just what it costs um so we work really hard on that in terms of how we funded it um again thank you to representative neuron for we got about $4 million in Lottery money um for the bridge and then we're doing what's called we have an urban renewal agency and there's this little tax trick that cities use it's called tax increment financing I'm going to try to tell you how this works in the easy way but think about it this way all the taxing agencies that overlap with Sherwood um in that District we freeze their taxes so say um toal and Valley fire paid a dollar last year next year it's going to be a dollar three because it goes up three cents we get that three cents for the next 30 Years so that that's how Tiff financing works it's a way that a lot of cities use to raise money our library our city hall this building were all built with urban renewal agency dollars that it's a very predictable source of Revenue so you can go out and bond against it um at a very very low rate um so what we were able to do is we set up that urban renewal agency it's expected to earn about10 million plus over its 30-year lifespan and because it's so predictable we can go to the bank and say can we get a loan against that um and we were actually when we did those some of these loans we were able to actually get some of these loans at very very aggressive rates around um don't quote me on this around 2% and then we put it in the bank and earned 5% right so we have an amazing Finance director who thinks through all this stuff but it allows us to accelerate those projects take advantage of that future predictable Revenue that's how we're paying with for it um the most important thing I think for community members we didn't have to raise any tax is you're not going to see additional property tax dollars to pay for the bridge good thank you for Bruce what is the massive building on Oregon Street that's a great question many of you may have seen it when you go from Oldtown or downtown you go uh down past the two roundabouts and you all of a sudden you see this large building uh on the hill Shining shining uh building on the hill and really there's somebody here who is very involved in it and I know John NE has already been mentioned uh he was the land partner and has become the partner with Schnitzer properties which is which is which is a partnership working on the development of what's known as the Sherwood Commerce Center that's uh the first phase is what you're seeing under construction right now almost complete quite frankly uh almost ready for occupancy and that is about 44 45,000 Square ft what's really unique about it is for multiple multiple companies and it is what they call a spec development which says a lot about Sherwood's industrial market and opportunities so what you have is you have big investment coming in and nobody knows who the who the end tenants are going to be at the very beginning but you know because this is Sherwood and this is a great location for for manufacturing Advanced manufacturing and Industrial companies it's going to get filled so um John and his Partners at Schnitzer properties have built the first phase the next phase will be phases two and three very similar type of design high quality design and it's going to u u we're expecting an application any day now to uh uh for the land use approval for phases two and three that'll be over another 500,000 Square ft so when that's done it'll be a little over a million square fet of new industrial park space in Sherwood and that's not all there's more coming so this is all part of the tonen employment area which has been planned for 20 years for new job creation and new balanced Revenue new Revenue sources for the city of Sherwood so we're very excited and I think at the time when John's project and the Schnitzer project you're done there'll be about space for 30 companies something something of that sort because it'll be a multi-tenant type of development and we're very excited about one of the most recent tenants that's going in and that's uh uh olymp controls which is robotics company so it's exciting to see this kind of advanced manufacturing happening in Sherwood",

        "text": " into theou and or have any further conversation with the applicants I'm prepared right now to to send this back to the hearings officer with several questions um because and I know this has been going on for a really long time but I feel like there was a lot of things raised today and some some areas of concern that I have about granting this application period outright um aside from the you emotional investment in this I think there's there is a public safety concern that that has arisen based on the testimony that we heard today which is a part of the criteria that has to be met um I have not had the ability to submitted videos or that's from the applicants you know there's this today yeah whatever but this is from the applicants this has nothing to do with the the residents or their attorneys and I would also like to talk to our Sheriff's Office and I would like to understand the perspective of the public safety component um there's just several areas that I think previously we did assert we would take into consideration there it's you know it I looked back at the conversation that we allowed Mrs Kramer to provide to us back last year we made those commitments and I feel like they're making the same request of us again and the two criteria yes there's this whole flood plan thing which is something that I'm not necessarily an expert on but Public Safety I'm pretty comfortable with addressing and having a conversation on and I don't feel that application is sufficient in addressing how Public Safety is um provided supported all of that um and I don't think that hearings officer also address that uh accurately for me to comfortably um make a decision so I don't I don't need to get into anything with applicants thank you for coming back up but I don't need you to do so that's fine so um Mr chair I I have some comments com well so I was also very much uh affected by um the testimony but I think I I need to sort of and I think we need to separate out a few different things because I think a lot of it got lumped together so I think some of the testimony um you know the question is uh permitting the dock will increase or have an effect effect on Public Safety right and I think one of the things that I heard today was that they already have public safety issues there now so a lot of the conversation was around the public safety issues that are there now um the way that I think about that is um that that's sort of independent of whether there will be additional public safety issues if the dock gets built right the public safety issues that are there now um exist in the current state now right and so the the question is whether there will be additional public safety issues the Dos get built right and I think one of the things that um I've thought for a while and um I'm just going to say it on the record is I believe that the situation that we're in and the comments and the concerns are a direct result a direct result of the Democrats and or again not being serious about Public Safety about people passing measure 110 legalizing drugs allowing criminals basically to go in and out of jail over and over and over again having people not feel safe in their communities um and it's not necessary so my wife's from the Midwest there are places where you do not have criminal activity all the time you don't have liability crimes you don't have constant theft you don't have people with cars being stolen over and over and over again like that is not necessary that is not a a natural condition of of civilization there are places where that doesn't happen and if we were to have places like that I think there would be much less concern about Parks right and and this is one of my frustrations um you know and the reason why I was so vocal about it and people criticized me for being against unregulated homeless camping in Parks it's because if you allow unregulated homeless camping in Parks then you don't allow kids there so you get to choose you can either say parks are places where kids can play or parks are places where drug addicts can live but it can't be both you have to choose and so I think this is this is something that is is a is a bigger issue and and I I understand what we're doing here but I think one of my concerns is I live in stayen I have a bunch of kids I'm also worried about my my wife being home alone I have people or I had luckily they went to prison I had people selling meth on my street I had an alley behind my house like we all live in the same thing right so I think one of the things that is also important is I can't prevent people from using the streets next to my house I can't prevent people from going to parks near my house um and I don't want to live in a place where we don't have streets and we don't have parks and we don't have Public Access I don't want to live in that place I want to live in a place where we have those things and I'm not worried about it because I don't have people who abuse their girlfriends in a trailer next to my house and that's not necessary we don't have to live in a place where we have the kind of crime that we're seeing on a daily basis in our community so I'm not sure what I'm going to do on this but I I I'm I think you know the the reality is there's a bunch of stuff that got mixed up here and the the public safety issues are here they're here because the state has failed at Public Safety and the leaders of the state have fa it our job today though to decide decide what that what accountability looks like in this particular decision because one of the criterias has to do with the interference with the adjacent lands and Public Safety those comments on the record today were declared by the residents who live literally on this we've we've all seen it we know what it is and respectfully um we denied a a placement of a park on an old landfill in a rural area because the neighbors were they brought forward their complaints of safety for their rural community which is very similar to what this is ston has a different um environment of support of Public Safety than the the previous mlay sighting and this Beville Aurora space for population and Public Safety I think that we've made consistent decisions along the way to really air on the side of caution for public safety and I currently do not see how Public Safety being emphasized in a way by the applicants period it's not even their responsibility it's not they have no jurisdiction over it whatsoever and in fact regardless of anou that somebody would have to probably enforce in court for them to redo a road which we know is very costly for a county a non-count owned Road there's additional burden there for the residents of this community for this dock aside from all the other things that were stated by the attorneys of the opposition so I I there is so much more to this than um it's evolved in my opinion since we heard this last time so so I appreciate the discussion of Public Safety um because I'm with you all and every resident in Maran County we have issues I get it I live in Detroit it takes 45 minutes minutes for a sheriff to get up there too um I do want to come back to the issues that were here uh the DSL some questions I have uh on the permit the DS what can somebody just say what DSL is because everyone keep say Department State lands thank you dep be using these acronym Department of State lands the the issue that uh the opponents brought up about removal of soil in the permit I need that question answered the greenway proposal uh um their comments about that and private access um and uh odf and W doc standards um so if we if we are going here I would like to um I mean there's two things I think that I want to suggest right here as motions uh one is you you mentioned sending it back to the hearings officer um potentially to help clarify some of those things for us and Brandon you can maybe clarify some of them for me right now or two uh leaving the record open and continuing this public hearing for a date certain in the future I'm going to look at Brandon and then legal counsel to talk about those two things so we do have a time frame for making a decision in this case and we've got some time but at this point we've got first off the applicant has a right for a 7-Day uh final argument so if we close the here a day they' have seven days and the board would reconvene with the hearing closed to make a decision um we and that would put us within our time frame yeah and I didn't mention that one but go ahead that's an option we the board if the board continued the hearing I'm concerned unless we get an extension I'm concerned that we'll run up against that rebuttal timeline for making a decision and there won't be time for the county to make its final decision in time or it could get referred to the hearings officer to make another decision or to take another look at this and um with that we need a 60-day any 60-day extension anything besides the 7-Day rebuttal then the board come back reconvening making a decision would need additional time granted by the applicant by the applicant for an EXT 60 days okay and if they do not then we will are looking at 7-Day open record for rebuttal only closing the hearing 7-Day open record for rebuttal then the board reconvening to make a decision no if we if if we refer this back to the hearings officer and you need a 60-day extension from the applicant if they do not give that if we if we make a motion to refer it back and they do not give that extension what happens then if we don't make the decision in time we could go to Circuit Court um be taken to Circuit Court to have them make the decision for the county or if we make the decision in time where there's not not it gets appealed there would be time for the board to accept the appeal and the hearings off officer decision will be the final decision for the um I guess the question is would the applicants I mean if you want to have full information would they agree to this 60-day yes well you don't I I guess legally you don't have to make that decision today it's a",

        "text": " plan for capacity needs i see it as uh typically they're designed to efficiently dispatch the resources that are there as cost-effectively as possible so i'm just curious if there's any more discussion on that point sort of how much of a what are the perspectives there on you know the need for out-of-market capacity planning is that how much of a barrier is that hey adam it's sarah i'm just going to take a general approach to your question and not necessarily go on a deep dive on ra capacity or capacity markets per se but i think the answer at least for me generally is i really hope that we don't want the market to solve all of our problems because we will never get uh we just will never get there um there are some things that make sense to embed in the market particularly those items that respond best to you know the economic signals of supply and demand there are some more difficult things that have made sense in other places to do out of market uh particularly if there's a variance among states about how to do certain and the the real fear that i've had for for a while is any specific state policies or legislation that that want that seek to embed themselves inside the market but we cannot accommodate all of that we can't accommodate multiple states views on a market signal let's say for example if we have multiple views on the cost of carbon that's that's a real tough one that's hard to do inside of the market for all views in all states and generally speaking we have some comments in our set of joint utility comments that address the need for potential out-of-market solutions i i really would caution against hoping that the market you can just plug it all in and it'll come out in a way that makes everybody mostly happy i don't even think that's maybe reasonable so sarah i don't know the basis for the bullet itself but what are your thoughts on the fact that an rto or some kind of footprint could provide clarification around imports and exports and seems since it's not utility by utility but it's now sort of a a group i'll say a group effort like you said maybe not everybody's happy in that effort but an rto can provide some clarification for how to solve some of these problems or the scope of them as opposed to an individual utility effort yeah i mean i look at what's going on right now in the region so you know look to the western resource adequacy program provided by the northwest power pool and assuming that continues to move forward it advances to all of the functionality that is envisioned there i see really any market solution whether it's rto or something less than as a potential complement to the foundational ra requirements you can connect those ra foundational planning pieces to an optimization engine that is able to give you a better economic solution in the day ahead and real time time frames associated with which resources you've committed for those needs so i see it more as not the provider of ra necessarily but as um maybe a more efficient engine that ra can be connected to and to the extent that foundational piece is transparent about how it treats imports and exports what it's assuming there how it's counting resources and i think um you you get what you're looking for out of it in some places in the nation the ra program did come from the market operator in other places it's like look to the kaiso it's coming from the california agencies they've partnered with kaiso to provide some of the market engine functions around that yeah thank you adam i was going to jump in on this out-of-market capacity mechanism question correct i think it could be helpful for the report to separate out for the legislature the existence of capacity markets as a function of rtos in other parts of the stemmed from a decision by those states compel their utilities or in some cases the utilities themselves decided to divest from having generation and so the need to have some other mechanism other than a traditional utility procurement process to acquire contracted for owned was the basis for forming a capacity mechanism in the first place in an rto in miso and spp mandatory capacity function doesn't and they've sidestepped the need for the out-of-market constructs that have really bedeviled new york and new england um eric and kaiser have handled this differently too without a capacity market so separating that out i think for oregonians to understand that is not that's not a necessity and given the status of the structure of the industry in the state it's probably not even an obvious option for organ in that point i think is emphasized by the fact that we have this regional re program that's about to launch serving much of the same function yeah this has been spencer beat me to this a little bit but i was going to say i think a lot of the the markets that have evolved over time have really started without a capacity function i'm not aware of any of them that started out as that being the first you know at the origination of the market um something that was there miso does have a backstop so they will go out and procure if the utilities don't come in sufficient up to a certain measure so there's some creative ways people have done this very differently throughout the us and throughout the i guess the one thing i would say on the benefit side though is that none of those mechanisms are really um they're possible but they're a little bit different and i think the northwest powerpoint is having that sort of realization as well without having an rto so having an rto does enable you know creative collaboration down the road but i don't think it necessitates that you start there um i don't at least i'm unaware of any example of a market that did start there and i think it's just worth pointing out that it enables some collaborative results that cross state lines that are done in a way with with local control in different markets throughout the the us like spp and miso for sure um and that every market kind of has a different approach to this one i mean california and texas are really hard examples because they're completely contained so i don't think i'd point either of those as kind of an illustrative thing i don't think that's what oregon is looking at in this effort all good points thank you for the for the discussion there i thought that was a yeah an important point to follow up on it's a it's a kind of a constant issue that gets circulated so i think having some discussion there is is good for the any other feedback or thoughts on this question too i'm happy to flip back to some of the previous slides if it's helpful otherwise uh i have a 10-minute break scheduled next before we get into question three adam just one other thought on the considerations bullets and maybe this is in a later slide you have but this is something we put in our comments it could be useful for the report to delve into a little bit of what the rtos are doing nationally on aggregation of distributed resources i really think that's an area of innovation that the rtos have jumped into on their own encouraged by ferc and are figuring out ways to aggregate distributed resources that i think are well suited for underserved communities to have more economic development in a way that feeds them back into the wholesale market and gives them a price signal that does not exist in the northwest right now there's good feedback and i i think that was one of your questions further on the list further further on down that i had planned to talk about at our next workshop it's kind of the uh downside of how he structured this is uh you know that's right that's a it's a good a good point and there's an equity network equity nexus there certainly hey adam this is nicole i'm sorry i dropped off the call just for a bit but and i don't know if this was already mentioned but just in the broader conversation of equity considerations in oregon i think this goes back also to the importance of a a governance structure which allows voices that we haven't you know historically seen represented in market in the in the process of considering these issues can you talk more about that nicole what i'm just curious to have you expound on that a little bit what you know are in your view good or better ways to to do this uh one you know markets that are more inclusive or less inclusive and what voices do you think i need to be heard more um so i think you know i sent you a report that i think is a really good one for everyone else to read it was a report done by exeter associates for the new england states committee on electricity and it's basically just a summary of all the different types of governance structures out there and as i um have been reviewing it um you know actually i think there's people on this call that are much more qualified to answer this question than i am but i'd say um a governance structure that has a truly independent board and one that has opportunities for what we'll call non-market participants so non-utilities non-loan serving entities load responsible entities to participate participation means it could mean being involved on a program review committee or as like you know something similar to original issues forum in the eim sense of the term where stakeholders have an opportunity to make sure their voices are heard and they have um feedback on certain and then the the other way stakeholders could have a voice in um how the market is formed and and how the market evolves is by having participation in the process of nominating board members and in the eim sense of the term that translates to a nominating committee that has representation of non-market participants on it so you know inclusion of of individuals or of of the industry that focus on issues like equity and making sure that customers the benefits of the rto for uh flow to customers would be an important addition so i'll i'll jump in after that um i i think there's actually a different way to approach it which is that it's not enough to just have diverse stakeholders participating if there's not actually decision making power for an organization or a community like the ones that verdi serves or for a tribal government then it's it's not meaningful participants uh participation but i'm really glad nicole that you mentioned governance because i think that is really where you can get to the heart of ensuring that benefits and burdens are are balanced i have a lot of concerns about the comment that there's no specific risks to underserved and low-income communities i think there are certainly risks with any",

        "text": " our area and I feel like this standard really doesn't it doesn't give us any um there's no action or anything that I feel like can be taken with this um even though there is a cumulative effect and there is a visual impact I'm not arguing that from the the commenter but at the same time I'm like how how is the council I don't like we have any standing on this standard because there's go there's already like you like has has been said there's already existing facilities it's like with the very first facility apparently you had some standing but now that it's established in the area in the region there's no there's no way for us to look at the the standard to amend it to the comment or if it's relevant right I mean we have to determine that if it's you know something that can be contested but I mean obviously there's four issues here on the visual impact they're really really trying to get that point across like any way they can with our standards um so I don't know if any any other council members have any um thoughts on that but it's something that um I struggle with because it seems like we're anyone have a comment councelor grail for the record this is Marcy Grail I mean I don't it's hard to identify one single person everyone could make the the argument of what the impact is to them um as a non-native Oregonian when I first drove here from West Virginia uh I remember driving through the gourge be like wow it's really neat and then I didn't drive back through for a while and then the next time I came through I felt like I was a a science fiction movie because of the the red lights um I drive through it you know at least monthly now if not more and I guess it's just the way it is doesn't make I can't fix it I can't undo it so I guess to your point I don't know and we have Council sitting there I guess if there's something that we could do or not i' Kick the Can across the room to Patrick but I I understand what you're saying it's I'm sympath athetic um I don't particularly like change anymore than some people do um I look at my own property and I see trees growing that are not mine and I think wow can I go follow those because they're viewing my my view from my loft of Mount St Helen is going away so I just cut him down yeah anyway uh I I guess I would um with all seriousness ask you know to if Patrick is able to comment on uh councelor im's comments because I don't know that we have anything we can do either Mr chairman counc dein before Patrick comments uh like to Echo some of the comments of counselor IMS and and also the other comments but the thing I wonder about is do we have any real guidance on what is a cumulative impact just I mean do we have any real standard that we can point to that you met it or haven't met it I'm going to pass the buck on this one to to secretary cornette because of his past experience in the land use arena with analyzing ctive effects we got a good team here we're yeah I I totally understand the you know the difficulty with the standard and and I think kind of the issue with it is it's it's not sort of Define what's what's the threshold what's the not to exceed or what's the Baseline what's the not to exceed threshold so I always point when people talk about a cumulative effect standard I always point to what to me is the gold standard which is the um the sage grous um so the state several years ago created a cumulative effect standard for sage grows so this was to prevent the federal listing as a threaten endangered species and you know between ODFW dlcd and FC we have three different you know standards which all points to the same thing but what that did what that analysis did is it said here's the Baseline the work was done the establishment of the Baseline to say this is what we have now and then they put in a cap and um I think it's uh I don't know 1% every decade and 3% cumulative not to exceed I I may be wrong on those but that's sort of the idea there is a metric um lacking a metric when you have a cumulative effects it becomes very difficult because people can and very frequently do interpret what the cumulative effect you know Baseline and threshold are so it's a difficult standard to implement it just is because it just puts it out there but it doesn't say what's the Baseline what's the threshold you know we're trying to evaluate so I mean I think you know the standard is probably right to re be relooked at in in rule making um and so I don't have any specific guidance for you um generally or in this case I just simply point to you know again the gold standard where you know you do the work to say this is what we have now this is what we can't get Beyond um and then that's a threshold metric that you know is out there and you can evaluate against we don't have that with with this standard yeah that was good explanation thank you Mr chairman okay um councilor delin then I'll go to the motion it would seem that for some areas it might be more possible to have a cumul standard that would be understandable I mean we've had some discussions in the past about the impact on agricultural lands particularly here agricultural ends that are irrigated there those that are not um I mean that would be an area where I think it'd be easier to come up with an actual standard uh we heard testimony yesterday on a different case that while there was an impact it was not a significant impact and it was to some extent mitigated but there could be a cumul impact in the future uh that might be something that we would want to avoid as a cumulative impact so and then on the visual side I'm wondering coming up to Colombia you know once you get out of the gorge which is a designated Scenic area the windmills start to appear particularly on the Washington side so I mean I don't know how you could have a cumulative impact in that area in the future um because it's already there um just saying that for the record and Mr chairman if if it's time appropriate I I'll make the next proceed thank you Mr chairman Mr chair I move Council find that Miss Wendy King properly raised the issue of compliance with cumulative effects standards for wind energy facilities regarding the reduction of adverse environmental effects and minimization of adverse visual features on the record of the draft proposed order public hearing with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to the issue Mr chair I further move that the council Deni the request for a contested Case by Miss Wendy King on the aforementioned issue because as recommended in the staff report while the issue is within the jurisdiction of the council it is not an issue of fact or law reasonably likely to affect the council's determination of whether the facility With The Changes proposed by the amendment meets applicable laws and standards do we have a second um Cindy condom for the record second thank you um Vice chair Condon so um secretary cornet could you please call the role Anne berer yes Cindy Condon yes Richard delin yes Mercy Grail yes K how yes Katie Imes yes motion carries Mr chair four down one to go thank you council members um so for the last issue the petitioner asserts that the certificate holder does not adequately address the visual impacts of nighttime Aviation safety lighting um in the request for Amendment and as a result the facility does not um comply with the requirements of uh the last section with the of effect standard which does require um minimization of lighting uh as as again as practical to reduce cumulative environmental effects um concerns about the visual impacts of the aviation lighting were raised again in both oral comments and written testimony and um uh so we we agree that this was raised properly raised on the issue go to the next slide um I'll maybe reduce this a little bit to say that the the back pattern is generally the same um the concern we believe that the petitioner was Raising was really with the prominence of those particular turbines on top of the but um and then the prominence of the blinking lights that would be on top of them um as we discussed a little earlier there is a condition in the site certificate requiring the certificate holder to use minimum lighting that was a existing condition um from when this facility was uh approved um we don't know of a way to really significantly reduce the visual contributions of those flights without eliminating those termines and again the Department's position is that we're unclear that that could be done in a manner that wouldn't significantly impact the ability of the certificate holder to operate the facility as um we also just noted that the minimum requirements for Aviation safety Whiting are uh imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration not by the state so there's no waiver of what the lighting requirements themselves are and I think as a council member dewin noted that's for a good reason they're important and necessary to protect aviators and Aviation traffic so um there's not a lot of specificity in the order but because there's there are federal standards set and because the I think underlying issue of the turmin themselves uh wouldn't be uh we don't we don't think there's a way to address that uh we would again recommend that this issue is not reasonably likely to affect the council's determination of whether the facility With The Changes proposed by rfa1 meets the requirements of the cumulative effect standard for women okay any further discussion by Council no do we have a motion somebody wants to make a motion I'll make the motion to deny the request for the contested case on issue by right yes I read the whole motion right now or is there need to be a second oh no go ahead and make a motion Mr chair I move the council find that Miss Wendy King properly raised the issue of compliance with the cumulative effects standard for wind energy facilities regarding visual impacts of nighttime Aviation safety Lighting on the record of the draft proposed order public hearing with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to the Mr chair I further move that the council Deni the request for a contested Case by Miss Wendy King on the aforementioned issue because as recommended in the staff report while the issue is within the jurisdiction of the council it is not an issue or",

        "text": "well and with that I think we have an agenda here that we can share so most of you may have already seen this on our website um we're going to kick it off with a little bit of a description of of this meeting and then uh we're going to dive right into some past meetings with the cie and the rmsb U Mark will take over from there but I just wanted to make sure everybody knew what we're here to accomplish this is Outreach to the uh stakeholders that have interest in Oregon's energy code development and uh we want to stay in touch with all of you and receive your input uh allow you to make those recommendations and thoughts here at this meeting or through email text messages or pigeons whichever method you prefer um so let's get started this is a going to be a great meeting got a lot of good things to talk about are you ready yes I am thanks all right I'll over the first sound coming through okay yes it is okay thank you all right so we're going to kick off with some of the uh more recent actions that took place at the residential and manufactured structures board meeting um at their April 3D meeting might have to choose the they did approve moving forward with the 2023 Oregon residential reach code um want to sort of give a background on what was put forward in the end was to have a uh more focused on code on aligning with incentives looking to simplify a little more and of course looking at longterm performance toward moving toward the um excuse me here something went off alarm here uh want to make sure that um we're looking forward to meeting the executive orders 204 and new house bill 349 so uh one of the moves it the Baseline for the reach code is the energy star version 3.2 National revision 13 which is going to be uh man the new version for anyone seeking energy star uh for homes sold after January 1st of 20125 a sort of Second Step Up from that is to use the Zero Energy ready home version two which took um became the standard in January 1st of this year and then of course also looking as the next step above that for the passive house us 21 21 core and zero methods uh the rule making uh notices should be coming out shortly I it may even be out online already uh late May early June will be the ruem hearing for additional feedback to the division and the anticip at effective date is July 1st of this year and we can go to the next slide at the construction industry energy board they met on April 10th as well um one thing that went through was to review with them as well Statewide interpretation 2302 about condensate drainage from heat pump water heaters a little more feedback on that is that um there were some reports of some units in colder climates uh probably located indoors where their condensate drain had Frozen and so knowing that this would come up and looking at what may or may not be considered a freezing location we wanted to make sure there was a Statewide interpretation out there and to clarify that um due to the installation instructions having a heat pump water here in her garage is not putting it in a location uh that's subject to free under normal conditions because it's a something we've seen in the past to make sure that there's some clarity on when condensate drainage for the manufacturer's installation instructions would need uh when and where it would need freeze protection they also approv Statewide alternate method uh 241 this was done at uh both boards it would allow the use of the 2021 International en energy conservation code the residential provisions and as an alternate to chapter 11 of the residential code so um if there are some builders in or some coming in from out of state who are more familiar with the iecc than our um State specific chapter 11 and this allows for the use of the model code as an alternate method um during the meeting as well there was a review of sort of the power plan and conservation Council sort of their power plan and how that's going to be developed there was some interest from our board um they wanted to find out a little bit more about so what's the future of the grid as we're seeing more electrification happening and wanted to get a little more feedback and it was a very good presentation and lots of good questions answered there um so that was the April 10th meeting um future meetings will get into the commercial uh region code so um that was announced that you know that is coming up for on how they will review that so slide on the reach code so the 2023 o rrc as we noted um would be looking at energy star version 3.2 which comes out on a weighted average probably somewhere around 15% better than the current o RSC chapter 11 and would be somewhere close to approximately you know equivalent performance to about the halfway point of what we're going to need to reach to meet the 20 the targets set under house bill 349 for our 2029 Oregon residential code the Z Zero Energy ready home version two takes things a little bit of a step further and goes to you know weighted somewhere around 20% better than the current code and of course passive is much higher and better and so any of these methods here the passive house um method pretty much requires you to get energy star certification and Z pretty well requires you to get the meet energy star requirements so any of these will be eligible for between 2500 and $5,000 in federal credits to The Builder as well as for people in um the IOU territories under Energy Trust of Oregon will probably have another uh amount of incentives that they can go for that for that the 2024 commercial reach code process is anticipated to be kicked off at the next construction industry energy board meeting um we'll be looking at whether there's a performance path or a prescriptive path and again trying this time to see if we can get things aligned with a uh set of incentives so that people can be encouraged to use quote the reach code and um get um be able to measure the actual uptake in the use of the reach code and see how that can hopefully in incentivize Market transformation to bring new building construction methods into the marketplace and make it more common place to make that easier to adopt into the next um commercial energy code slide and just wanted to pop up sort of the prescriptive requirements for the version 3.2 National program it's you know different from our current uh prescriptive path in the 2023 RSC um the prescriptive slab Edge for a slab on grade home is a deeper less insulation but deeper the um walls would be R20 with R5 continuous insulation um same for walls above grade so that's a a significant jump although these all can all be traded off the windows same as our current code doors need to be slightly better than current uh residential code ceilings would go from a r49 to an r60 um has a minimum test requirement to get down to 3 A50 which is becoming a lot more common in the state of achieving that level and of course lighting 100% LED uh lighting the efficiency of the Furnace pretty and cooling for gas are pretty much in line with what our current additional are and then as well you're looking at the um heat pumps well that's our current requirement are pretty are actually ahead of this for if you're doing an additional measure uh if you're a gas water heater it would need to be a high efficiency for um probably an instantaneous unit uh condensing style and a minimum uef of 2.2 if you're using a heat pump water heater so to the next slide we can just look at in the Zero Energy ready home a lot of the pieces are similar um with some items like the water heaters and the heat pump efficiencies are a little and air ceiling are at a higher level than the Zero Energy ready home so those are some steps up from the previous slide and then we can look at the passive house on the I believe that's on the next slide um we did modify um the the board wanted uh and it's really show editorial we're simplifying the language um so that each of the three paths are pretty clear that it would be either be the um Zero Energy excuse me the um passive house current program and then of course as you note see here to achieve the pH the passive house compliance path you need to have the energy star and the Z met so that would be under the new program and of course the Z has the indoor air plus required as part of it as well so um these will be really good quality homes for those seeking to do the passive house path next slide I think this one's me Mark oh okay thanks Roger absolutely any well before we go into this are there any questions for Mark and any of the discussion that he just provided I'm not hearing anything I don't see any in the chat so far so we we'll move forward and then come back with any questions after a bit so as Mark alluded to or uh briefly described the federal tax credits uh are here in front of you for energy star and for uh Zur and um single family homes uh $2,500 certified to eligible energy star single family new homes uh prog program requirements and those are substantial you might check that out online uh manufactured homes also gets a $2500 bump available for certified eligible energy star manufactured homes uh lots of program requirements around that and then multifam there's a $500 uh incentive is available for home certified eligible Energy Star multif Family new construction or f f mfnc program requirements with a larger tax credit of $2,500 available when prevailing wage requirements are in place and then also the Zur or zero energy ready home receives a $55,000 if it's sold after January 1st 2024 it's probably going to be happening now um these are all brought about by the inflation reduction Act of 2022 amended by the re Revenue code under 45l you'll see that used here on the slides so that's a Revenue code and they're to provide eligible contractors with a tax credit for eligible new or substantially reconstructed homes that meet each of these qualifications the energy star the Zer so some pretty substantial tax credits that are",

        "text": " funded by community they're funded by investors so there might also be a risk um for investors of a project versus risk to a community and this depends on what the um how the how the project is attributed i feel like i probably missed a lot in that risk conversation um but uh let's see i think i had some other notes yeah so depending on who is exposed to the risks can have disproportionate impacts um on smaller communities who um in their ability to maybe where where you know whether an event um and again that's production and performance risk specifically um yeah i will i probably like i said probably missed a lot there so um if i missed anything i'll open it up to um to my group members or if i miss um uh communicated something that would agree to me all right um it was just uh steve huffleman and myself for group three um and he graciously allowed me to be the speaker um that was a joke uh invite we talked about the cost of environmental impact i'm not going to type these because i'm not that good at multitasking as we've discovered um environmental impact studies can be a higher proportion of overall costs for these small-scale projects um we talked about how especially with non-solar small-scale projects they have a very hard time getting economies of scale great enough to actually go through with the project we talked about interconnection costs islanding costs um wheeling charges came up and how those can really you know tilt the skills towards a project not being viable um uh zoning costs um we just these are just the broad topics that we went through infrastructure and grid costs and one thing that specifically came up was the right-of-way costs if you're having to install um some transmission lines through an area where you then have to get the right-of-way on top of the actual um just building the project um uh getting uh paying for the expertise in engineering to develop a lot of these projects can be a very very big cost um and then also just uh finding skilled labor um can be a huge cost not necessarily unique to small scale but you are competing with some of the larger skill projects um did i miss anything steve no no that sounded good thank you all right group four and i'll add mine to the list after the all right and i do have notes um stephanie so that we can true up after the meeting but we had a lot of a similar discussion to what we've heard in other groups we had some specific things one was the the nature of um of reimbursement schedules through purpa is that you're trying to make a 20-year schedule in a unpredictable future around pricing and that there's kind of value and risk associated with that process i mean developers want the 20-year contract for bankability but there's just kind of this unknown um cost structure associated with a 20-year energy price prediction so that's that was part of it brought up something that perhaps turns into a recommendation or a it's essentially a policy oriented um the restriction of community solar and purple projects in the case of solar to three megawatts um that that is a essentially an market struck you know construct which is affecting the ability of projects to take advantage of the economies of scale that could happen from three megawatts up to 20 megawatts which is where we see a lot of the other thresholds occurring in targets for small scale in this study so perhaps 20 megawatts could be a threshold for all programs in the state maggie brought up the tribes and some other communities may not have credit ratings and so access to credit and developers project development is limited in certain communities that goes for both planning and construction and this gets to the capacity issue that we've heard in the past also kind of related to large large developers often have in-house staff that small projects would have to hire out as consulting staff and so it may come at a higher price for services like engineering and um you know development of project drawings and all that sort of thing can be higher if you have to if you have to contract that out mike brought up that a lot of these projects are cited within cou territories or will be cited within cou territories and that these cou's often have a 100 contract requirement with bpa and so they don't really have a use for the power and the result is that you um they don't have an incentive to develop them and then if it's being developed for another utility that's not in their territory we have the wheeling costs um which hit the projects with a you know financial penalty an interesting one also for mike was that you know rural areas and i guess this isn't necessarily unique to small scale but it's certainly unique to the remote rural projects is limitations on housing and workforce drive up the costs associated with getting projects built in rural areas because you have to account for travel and essentially you know getting getting your workforce to the site um angela also brought up that current regulations and rates don't recognize the value of storage or really any of the ancillary benefits that can come from these projects and so you know we talked about if we really want to bring along both the value of batteries for their ancillary benefits as well as the resilience value um there should be you know a mechanism to recognize those values within the rates and that some of those rates are truly um benefiting utility ratepayers and there may be an opportunity there i don't know if i've missed anything really um obvious that hasn't been brought up i definitely welcome the the crew to jump on because i bounced around in my notes a lot let's see if anyone does in the meantime while we're turning over to ruchi um for the last group or whoever's presenting for that last group are there if anybody is planning to get a public comment can you raise your hand so that we kind of know if we have any public comment the last couple workshops we haven't had any but if we do have any i want to make sure we give you time and since we were running 10 minutes late from the beginning of the day um we're we're not going past one o'clock don't worry i'm just trying to like manage the that we have left the seven minutes as fast i can so we can go over to richie and if there's no hands up then or if there are that's great too um great i can get started uh our group was mark ryan and tom this time from lane county central electric co-op and uh we generally talked about um how it's difficult to take advan advantages of the economies of scale with a small scale project and there's the risk of you know bpa costs if you get too large i talked about interconnection costs um mark mentioned the pilot on the landfill as a example of that um we talked about how the number of incentives that are out there exist because of the interest in bridging the gap between uh small you know for small-scale projects to pencil out tom had an example of you know ashland the incentives that they have on solar is why they have such high penetration of rooftop solar for residential and commercial we talked about how um just in general subs without subsidies these projects don't um pencil out and there needs to be a lot of mindfulness in making sure that non-participating members of a utility are not subsidizing participating members of a utility to the rate structure if it's being um if if those costs for a smaller smaller projects are being bridged with repair funds i mean we had kind of a general discussion about california and how there's just not quantification of how um their sort of willingness to pay for you know a major disaster like cascadia some of the fires that have been um experienced if you need to have an eoc running for two months two weeks or a couple months um you know that's that might be a really high cost for that kind of small project but it might be worth it um you know if if your other kind of option is diesel generators that might have the diesel running out over that time period and so how how much is that it's probably a lot but the value is really high and who should pay for it was kind of an interesting aside that lends itself to the sort of yes it might be a high cost for smaller projects but there might be also high value so it's worth it and then just a caution that there's really low rates in in oregon you know seven and a half cents here and one of the comparisons for california was 35 cents a kilowatt hour so um that's that's a piece and then another interesting aside was the social cost of anxiety when there's that results in a real economic impact in the community for fire cascadia heat uh okay i think that that's kind of a sum up anything i missed tom mark or sounds good great put all those beautiful notes do you want to go to the next slide do you want to go out do you have anything you want to go ahead with there no i was just going to thank everybody and see if there were any questions so i know we're very limited on time give a second for any last-minute questions i don't see any hands up or um right now but um but yeah thanks everybody for attending um so what's next for this group is on july 6th our workshop number four crew will be getting together and be talking about planning for that workshop which is going to be kind of summarizing what we heard across the three first workshops um and then also where there's data gaps things that we haven't gotten to discuss yet that seem really important like i have on my mind like can we quantify some of the non-economic benefits of um of these sorts of projects is something we haven't really dug in on yet just to give one example so we'll kind of like work together to identify where those gaps are and then plan a workshop accordingly but that workshop will also be where we discuss and generate possible solution ideas so um that will be coming up so what that planning meeting will happen july 6th and then the last meeting of this group um unless something comes up will be july 28th and we'll be working to get raphaelis to flanders we also got another request for maybe aberdeen washington for that project potentially um if they have somebody who could come present so we'll be working on putting all of that together with our staff and",

        "text": " commercial that since changed through the our Salem project to what you just saw and the neighborhood context and Community priorities have sort of shifted over the last 40 years as well through the our Salem project we heard a desire to see more walkable mixed-use development in the city to help reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions and especially close to frequent Transit on a corridor like this there are two primary restrictions that these overlay zones apply that I want to talk about this evening the first is the height limit that it imposes so there's a maximum height of 35 feet which is the same as our single family Zone and then it also provides an additional setback adjacent to the streets that are just off of Commercial Street so Saginaw Street to the West and West Knob Hill Street to the east um I'll start with maximum height so as I mentioned all five overlay zones have a 35 foot maximum the base zoning allows a few different maximum Heights and they're all in line with some of our other commercial zones in Salem um and are we find these zones all over the city and so it wouldn't be out of context with what we see on other major to give everybody kind of an idea of what development might look like without these overlay zones I tried to pull some examples that kind of line up with each different bass zone so the one on the left there is just across the street here it's a five-story building and that's about or it is 63 feet that's about as much as you would see in the mu1 zone the next example going left to right is a building that's still under construction down at rubitz and Liberty it's four stories and that's about the most you would see in the mu2 zone the next example is the Marion County and chariots building downtown and it's 70 feet and that's the highest you would see in the mu3 zone and then that last example is the tallest building right now in the overlay zones and it's a three-story so um that gives you an idea of kind of the types of development potential that could exist though it wouldn't require buildings to be developed to this height it's just what the market would dictate moving on to setbacks there are kind of two elements to take into consideration so I mentioned those setbacks adjacent to the streets one off of commercial if those were eliminated the mixed use one and two zones have a zero to ten foot setback adjacent to streets but it's important to understand that when there's a double Frontage lot so for example a lot that had Frontage on both commercial and West Knob Hill Street that setback only applies to the higher classification street so adjacent to commercial you would have a zero to ten foot setback and then that set back wouldn't apply to West Knob Hill and it could be larger the mixed use three Zone has a little bit wider range so five to thirty feet and again we would expect development to happen closer to commercial though in this Zone it could be on the lower classification Street as well um the other element is that the base zones now these mixed use zones have a setback that increases as buildings get taller so the higher the building the further it has to be from an adjacent residential Zone and that applies when two properties are directly touching each other or across an alley but it doesn't apply across streets um okay so to in terms of some of the city's broader priorities this proposal does have some implications the map on this screen shows the Chariots core Network in Red so that's our Core Transit lines as well as the city's and so by allowing taller buildings here we allow the potential for more housing density especially close to those Core Transit lines that we have that helps reduce the need to drive as people can walk to meet more of their daily needs taller buildings denser buildings also tend to have a lower greenhouse gas emissions footprint per housing unit it also allows some flexibility in the market to dictate what might be feasible based on market conditions and property individual properties and and what they can accept it is worth acknowledging that this could have some impacts on adjacent uses whether it's more people parking on our public streets or whether it's taller buildings overlooking someone's backyard those are real consequences but um it's also worth understanding that this wouldn't be unique to these locations we have zoning all over the city where mixed use zoning is adjacent to residential zoning so further south on Commercial and Liberty on Lancaster Market Street Silverton Road north of downtown and in West Salem these same sorts of adjacent zones exist so removing these overlays wouldn't create impacts that are unique to this location but they are worth considering um we've received a fair bit of testimony about this proposal the scan neighborhood association has requested to maintain the 35 foot maximum height but they'd be willing to let go of the other development standards in the zone or the overlay zones other comments have aligned with scans requests or have opposed the proposed change due to concerns about traffic and parking infrastructure improvements things like changes in property value and then just the overall livability and compatibility of the potential future the development though we also received one comment in support of The Proposal because it aligns with the city's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals as well as encouraging more walkable development so staff's recommendation is to advance ordinance bill number 5-23 for the purpose of eliminating the Saginaw Street Superior rural Oxford West Knob Hill Oxford Hoyt and Hoyt mcgilchrist overlay zones to Second reading and I'm available for questions thank you we'll go to public comment and then we'll come back for questions to you Austin thank you for your three minutes all right so just as a reminder you have three minutes uh when we call you up hit the green button so the microphone comes on and uh the the yellow light will flash when you have a minute left and then the red light will come on when your time's up if you would end your comments at that time I would appreciate it first up we have Evan West and we have a total of six people signed up Evan West thank you I was asking our neighborhood association representative if she wanted to go first some of my comments might make a little less sense in that context but I'll thank you we're just going to go and thank you I appreciate it I'm Evan West I'm a resident of Ward seven mayor Hoy members of the city council I'm standing before you today that you please hear and ask that you please hear and please move forward with the requests that will be made by the scan neighborhood association which is to maintain the existing building height requirement in the five overlay zones unfortunately I feel that much of what Mr Ross said is untrue height requirement is critically important in our neighborhood and to provide just one example of why from the top of Rural Avenue to West dob Hill there is roughly 100 feet of elevation change that's a unique topographical challenge in our Valley Community I joined my neighborhood association colleagues in knocking on doors to Canvas neighbors and hear their thoughts and opinions on this matter and neighbors were nearly unanimous time after time I heard neighbors say we absolutely do want mixed-use development we absolutely do want more residential housing and we absolutely do want Transit oriented development every neighbor also said something along the lines of we want city council to do this in a way that preserves the unique human scale of our neighborhood and our community we're not in New York City we're not even Portland and we shouldn't pretend to try to be what was most concerning to me was the sheer volume of neighbors who said we're very worried that city council will call us elitists say it's all about nimbyism or simply ignore us entirely I assured my neighbors that city council is thinking about the future of our community the best future of our community and is absolutely capable of hearing our very reasonable requests our request is that while you rightfully seek to establish equity in planning and development Citywide please do not confuse it with equality one size will never fit all in City Planning I want to thank you for demonstrating to your constituents today that you have concern for maintaining human scale in our community and perhaps even more importantly that you're able to hear their requests and meet their needs as I have assured them thank you for your service to our community are there any questions for me councilor Stapleton thank you so much um for coming down um could you explain human scale for me thank you I appreciate that I'm an architectural historian by trade and education so I threw on a technical term there human scale is planning and development that is designed for humans out of cars humans interacting with our landscape and our built environments um what that means to give an example of the contrary I know that's not what's happening here but a skyscraper is out of human scale we can't interact with buildings that are beyond our own and that doesn't mean communities that have skyscrapers have failed in that regard large cities Thrive because of their thriving public transit New York City Boston Etc had incredible public transit course and it's different uh in building vertically in communities that do not have that yet so that's a very brief description of what human scale means as it means a landscape design for humans to interact with on thank you thank you Mr West for your for your uh comments I have a question for you and actually I'm going to have the same question for everybody who's going to be speaking tonight because this is the thing I'm struggling with when I'm considering this why are these these properties and it's it's not a it's not a lot of properties it's pretty limited number when you consider it in the context of the whole why should we treat these properties differently than we treat the rest the entire rest of our city why is it different so if and if everybody could I'm going to ask you if you don't address it in your comments because that's what I'm struggling with it's like what's unique about these properties that the rest of the city you know I mean that's a good question yeah I think there's a number of potential answers um I'll stick with what I've mentioned already which is that um in this part of scan there's a huge amount of topographical change which means even a four-story building creates a huge impact on both sides of the elevation change on one side it Sunrise lights on the other side it impacts Sunset lights the neighbors who um a lot of Neighbors in this community are microfarmers grow fruits and vegetables and would be heavily impacted by that change alone that's something that stands out to me and",

        "text": " do that. We want to get through everybody. Yes, sir. Steve Luciank. 94 80 Southwest 94th Loop. Thank you for your service to our community and to the county. We're the residents of on top of the world, okay? We're not consultants, we're not lawyers, we're not anything. We're just people. Okay? And the ones that are really affected by this zoning change even can't be here tonight. The ones along the property line that have ill health that just can't make the trip. This is an age restricted community in an area of age restricted communities where kids on skateboards and bicycles don't cause any safety issues with crutches, canes or walkers. Okay. As you will hear, our specific concerns are going to be safety, losing the feeling of well being and peace and its impact on our health. Increased traffic and flooding, increased assessments for security and road maintenance on 99th Street Road, and the need for retail goods and services with golf cart access. Because a lot of our residents only have golf carts. They don't drive anymore. And you'll hear some more things along, too. We had very little notice on this. We're 13 days into this ourselves, and we just kind of threw it together. And again, it's ad hoc. And by the seat of our pants, the signs were thin. Cardboard with four staples. They were gone a few days after they were put up in the rainstorm that hit us. Okay? So we lost a lot of notification to our community. We ask you because of that. Okay? So we can get our act together is possibly postpone this vote until the next meeting. If not, consider this. It's spot zoning. It's jamming something into an area that does not fit. Okay? It's got a higher density than Oto. And it's also to the detriment of some of the most vulnerable people in the community in the twilight of their lives. Senior citizens on fixed incomes impacted by big inflation. And probably the last home of their lives. Mister Collin. Great guy. Built a beautiful place. We love to live. Okay? He's the best developer in Marion county. But he's made one error and this is it. And we're asking to give us peace in our final years. No rezone. It doesn't fit. Thank you. Thank you. If you. All right, listen. We're gonna all go outside and come in one at a time. If we continue the clapping and whatnot. It's disruptive. Please. Yes, ma'am. I've been waiting for you all night. And I am on top of the world. Even though I have red on. So don't. Don't think badly of me. My name is Karen Carol Kowalski. I live at 82 circumental 60 Southwest 93rd Terrace. In on top of the world. Many of my issues have been addressed. I do ask, though, will these apartments be in any way subsidized by the federal or state governments? So HUD housing is what I am used to that being called in California. So can you assure us that there will be no subsidized rent on these people that will be there? I'm going to leave it on Mister Tillman to mark that down. He generally does a good job of taking notes. If you don't mind, Mister Tillman. Someone can address that when you come back up. And my last thing is, it's tragic that we are not in a position to allow additional. But our whole system as far as hospitalization, healthcare, schools, markets is so low at this time. We need more of that. So I just worry that having additionals such as this, people aren't going to be able to get the services that really. They really need. But my biggest thing is I want assurance that these are not subsidized housing. Very good. We'll get that for you later. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Yes, my name is Nancy Karp. I live at 8673 Southwest 96 Lane, unit G 4481. Good evening and thank you. Our residents chose Oto specifically for its amenities, natural surroundings, safety, security and golf cart access. The apartments are not compatible with our lifestyles as seniors and that's not what we signed up for. We now feel safe with the gate, even though it's just for cars coming and going. However, the apartments will destroy any type of safety or security that we now feel our security will be shattered. That's not what we did when we bought here. Multifamily apartments. No matter how well you screen, tenants will or could endanger us. Kids. We are all kids one time are curious whether you're a good kid. Not good. You could be perfect. You're going to wander. There is absolutely zero activities. Zero in the southwest 200 area for children. Nothing. No bowling alleys, no movies, nothing. What are those kids going to do? They have a pool in their community. Whoopee. They're going to wander. They can go through bushes. They can climb fences. They're going to take their skateboards, their bikes, walk and even possibly a golf cart through our community, which we don't have a sidewalk. That was the picture of our golf cart pass, not sidewalk. Look, these are kids. We know what they will do. And we need to take care of ourselves. If we need to beef up our security, that's going to put a financial hardship on the people living and on top of the world. We don't need the more people there. We take our golf carts everywhere. And with 749 more people, the restaurants there, it's not many are crowded. Publix is crowded. To get in and out of that parking lot, please, no rezone for multifamily apartment. Thank you, Miss Karp. Protect our community. And I will remind everyone else to stand in as two lengthy conversations about children. So tell us something good, something different about children. If you don't mind. Sir, my name is Mark Kellogg. I live at 10149 Southwest 99th Lane in Ocala. And I found about this last Friday. So I couldn't, other than putting this together, I couldn't get it distributed in time. So I've got a big package I want you to take a look at. A few pictures. I think pictures help. So the front view is the front entrance to our community that the kids will see when they look in. I want you to go forward to page four. So this is about traffic. So I know traffic is kind of a generous term, but the first point I have on the traffic study is the traffic study didn't consider whatsoever the on page four, the huge build out of on top of the world. They only considered the apartments and the current traffic to OTO. That's all on. .2. If you look at page five, you will see the accident and injury rate on 99th and sr 200 as registered on your own website. And you'll see that our accident rate is actually going up faster than the one on 80th and 200. And we have higher injury rate and severe injury rate. So we think 99th 200 is going to be a problem. .3. We think you've got to do something on that intersection of 99th and 200 that's not even proposed by the engineering assessment. And if you go to page seven, you'll see the specific change, which is to add a left turn lane, a left turn only lane to 99th and 200. Exiting the community today, we had a hard time getting out to get here because of that lack of a left turn lane. Point 490, 9th and 200. There were no improvements. So I'm out of time. So the next four pages are your 2045 plan. You have no planned improvements in that area. And then the last page, the traffic study, I think, has some flaws, and I identify a couple. I don't think you're going to allow a lot of extra businesses to exit or entry directly onto 200. And he says you will. Thank you. Yes, sir. Good evening. My name is Bill Ashton. I live at 8008 Southwest 96 Terrace Road in Ocala. I moved here a year ago from Fredericksburg, Virginia. My wife and I did a lot of research to come to the Sunshine State, specifically to Marion county, how beautiful Marion county is and what it has to offer. It has to offer a lot for senior citizens. And that was one of the biggest things why we selected, on top of the world, a 55 and older community. My concerns are, which have been mentioned a number of times here, is mostly security and crime. I don't know what the developer has said when they said they have a number of other areas in Florida and they probably been very successful. But my question to them would be, can you tell me from the time you put people in those places, what was the crime increase or decrease there? I think that needs to be looked at. We do have Ocala police Department. We do have the sheriff's department. I just don't think that they're ready for this increase in the number of people that will be there. The other thing is on top of the world, I think it was previously mentioned, we have security, as in the gate, and the gate is only security for vehicles coming into our spaces. It is not a security for a golf cart or somebody walking or somebody riding a bicycle into on top of the world. And with the increase of people outside, that's going to potentially cause an increase in crime in the area. So whether on top of the world themselves decide to increase the security. And as the",

        "text": " up with a more realistic assessment of what the capacity of these areas are and logically to go and look and identify other areas that have potential to decline-friendly areas um you have in my written memo come with some of the analysis here but I really want to emphasize how excessive and unrealistically estimates are that have been prepared so far and just to forgive the city a little bit they're following the recommendations that the LCD provided in their roles but those were untested and we all at least an advocacy expressed concern about this from the beginning but the estimates say um that basically these areas these four areas that include downtown Lancaster uh West Salem and I'm sorry I can't remember the fourth uh Liberty and Commercial I'm sorry um but those four areas could accommodate 55 000 units of housing that's all in excess of what's needed but currently our adopted plans estimate and this is out again through 2035 2040. that those areas will have about 3 000 units of housing that's 15 times as much housing as our current plans estimate will occur in those areas it assumes a density of about 60 dwelling units per acre across each of those areas that's pretty substantial and basically assumes that we're gonna we need to not only develop the vacant plan that redeveloped land that's already there to kind of density um I think the other way to look at this is that meeting that 30 goal again 26 000 units of housing in climate-friendly areas uh would mean that we basically have to put all new housing that occurs in Salem in those kind of friendly areas to go from 3 000 which is what we're currently planning for to 26 000. so I think that gives you a picture of really these are unrealistic estimates um the dlcd rule does allow the city to come up with its own method an alternative method for calculating capacity and actually a thousand friends and I wrote all of the cities that are responsible for doing this in January and said hey if you get unrealistic results which we think you will you should take advantage of this option to come up with based on your plans and your local knowledge and experience with a better estimate of what the real capacity of these areas are and so just really to bring it first full circle where I think you ought to go from here is do a more realistic assessment of what you think the capacity of these areas are and then based on other planning that you've done identify other areas in the city that have potential to serve as climate-friendly areas and I'm here today because there's a little bit of urgency to this um the deadline for getting the kind of friendly area study done is this then based on that climate-friendly study a year after that and next year 2024 the sea has to designate private friendly Air Base if we fall way short on that first step which is what I think we're doing right um we're going to be playing catch up uh to accomplish and meet that goal so I I apologize that I've come to you quickly on this I don't know how much background you've had I hope that makes sense I'd be happy to answer the questions for Lisa she's ready I have a couple questions I'm just going to direct it to um so I'll throw it out um what is the difference I guess what is the criteria for climate friendly areas there they could have to be a certain size it has to have certain infrastructure existing already um it's not that it has to have certain infrastructure just have to be certain size you can't pick corridors because I have 150 feet so we fought against that in the rules so for example we can't designate State Street as a climate friendly or does it meet the criteria it that's just they didn't want corridors they won areas um and then there like Bob says there's a prescriptive way to calculate the housing so I think dlcd's goal is that the zoning is a box that people can develop within and they can develop really high high density within there um our zoning allows that uh we were tracking this through RSA loan so we accommodated that generally in our zoning but the last minute they did change minimum density so as Eunice and Julie presented last month we'll fix minimum density from our perspective the the it's circle on a map for a climbat-friendly area because we pick North downtown Downtown West Salem because it's already zoned for high identity it already named the zoning except for the minimum density in our mixed-use zones and we're going to change that to meet the minimum densities that will increase the minimum density and we're going to apply it Citywide we rezone like 2 000 acres to mixed use through our Salem all of our corridors are mixed use they're already dominated housing the city set of goal right so I agree the housing that's that the mathematical formula says could fit in there is not going to be built in downtown but we followed the rules that the state has set out for designating an area and we've done way more than that through our Salem by rezoning all kinds of areas for mixed use based on our core Network and where we have Transit just later follow so in listening to the two comments here is is the difference the the question corridors versus squares or polygons or whatever we want to call it that this is a real difference between what's going on um maybe I think what Bob is saying is he wants us to draw the circles and and do the math and show a more realistic of what's what housing is going to be built um I guess from our perspective is we spent four years doing that work and adopted it through our Salem and have set goals for housing along the major you know Transit Network downtown et cetera and the state's putting this extra requirement on us okay the rules kind of assume a city has not zoned areas for high density mixed use right and so it's like pick an area and then Zone it for mixed use housing's permitted you know maximum height of like 85 feet minimum density and all these places across the city uh once you designate a CFA uh you know make sure you're zoning accommodates the housing and then you have to plan for um you know great head bike infrastructure change block length and that kind of stuff which we're planning to do across the city with the tsp right so when Julian municipator saying this is kind of the first phase of the TS feed which the council's asked us to get going on the transportation system plan but we have this deadline for the CFA and the scenario planning at the state just kind of delaying our work on the transportation plan so while the rules provide a prescriptive path we don't see a benefit in it because it's more work to meet this technicals like I set out a very clear criteria if you can do this math and show your zoning accommodates is how housing then you've met the rules if you want to do something different it's kind of nebulous about how you would get there and it's a lot more work we already have rezoned all kinds of land across the city for high density mixed use along our major corridors so we just don't see a benefit and doing more kind of mathematical work did you ever follow to get through this project it doesn't you know we have two long range winners right I mean we don't we have so much work we're doing just doesn't we don't see a benefit in it what's your thoughts and then I will come back to umright to respond to his question is is this a question that's it sounds like this is maybe a capacity versus expected development and ultimately we're required to provide 30 of the capacity provided which is what's been done right so it's not really I mean there's no way to predict really accurately how many real units of housing will be developed over the next 20 years so if I wanted to read this as a percentage of potential capacity and they are saying a project effectively designated many areas throughout the city as uh excuse with the ability to be that that that's my understanding of what's happening is that correct that's what I want to make sure that is correct and in our Salem and the comp plan we set a goal of of a percentage of all new dwelling units within a quarter mile of the transit Network in areas that's designated for mixed use so downtown River you know the river area and all our mixtures are corridors and in 2021 that was 34 we set a goal for 20 30 35 for that to be 35 of all all and that looks at existing right so like we set a more realistic goal in our Salem based on what we have and then what we were Zoning for then what you know the Council of government who did the you know formula Force for the CFA the draft what they're showing the capacity could be based on you know we fought back against the state we were on the rule making committee Julie and I um you know the calculation was like eight-story buildings and 900h units 900 square feet you know that seems ridiculous and that's what they came up with and you know we fought that battle and we lost that battle a year ago we met with the state planners a lot we got a lot of themes to be different and the cfek rules um based on our relationship with the state and a lot of meetings they were willing to take with us outside of the um body but we this is a rule and we play for complying with the rule we've demonstrated there's more than enough capacity in the areas that we've picked um as Julie Nunes said we have to look at displacement and so that's what we're focusing on instead of doing more of the math you know around the city and actually tonight is the first Equity Roundtable meaning that they you know talked about doing so she's doing that right now at Center 50 plus to focus on the displacement part of the project that's what we feel like makes more sense to focus because we already did four years of scenario planning and rezoning and general Outreach across the through our Salem Mr Cartwright do you want to respond to any of the commercial studies I certainly do um I think I stand by by what I said yeah the overall objective here regardless of the method you use is we want 30 of all housing 26 000 units to be in climate friendly areas um I appreciate the work the city's done through our Salem and designated mixed use some of that I think has potential to",

        "text": " been with us like on that code enforcement change and also like that they're starting to allow buildings to get built a little bit higher if they're like right on our core Network lines so I'm really excited for all that director Duncan I have a comment more than anything not really a question but I really wanted to emphasize I really appreciate the year and review summary um and the increases in boardings and revenue hour uh boardings and then talking about all the increases we did because I just want to highlight how the work that we're doing is supporting a population who wants to be using this service and the more we provide the more they show up and so the City of Salem meeting us where we are and preparing for the population increases we know we're going to have and the increased Demand on our services is vital for us to be able to continue to serve the community and and putting the numbers out in front of us like this is really helpful in supporting what we're doing with data I know that there are a lot of people in Salem who don't take the bus and it can feel like oh not that many people are impacted and this really highlights that many people are impacted and the more we do the more people are finding the service accessible and the more people use it and I just wanted to highlight that because you did that really well here in numbers and I didn't want that to get missed so thank you much yeah oh definitely seconding director Duncan's comments I mean also kudos to whoever put that all that information together in such like a very appealing graphic I feel like we should call that the year of Chariots I mean I'm totally co-opting that after like my favorite author Brandon Sanderson he did a year of Sanderson because they rolled out like something every quarter and it feels like we rolled out something every quarter for the community so it also attests to the great work that our entire team is doing so thank you very much there there's a lot of good people putting uh hard work behind this absolutely all right that moves us into our general manager report right thank you so in front of you you do have uh your board talking points for the month ahead just want to reiterate one of those and that's the ETC Institute survey so beginning uh Saturday uh we will have survey takers this will be wave three of the customer satisfaction and we're also right in the middle of the cust or Community value survey uh and hope to have those results back in December uh and sharing with you probably at the January board meeting uh also uh uh earlier this week uh strategic initiatives administrator Bobby kid uh led a group of Marian County uh sustainability network uh business Representatives on a tour of Kaiser Transit Center uh they met here at downtown Transit Center rode the bus out to Kaiser Transit Center uh toured all the sustainability features that are featured at that facility uh and rode the bus back and the word back was uh a good morning was had by all even though the weather was a little uh uh crummy but uh it was a great way for us to Showcase uh our leadership efforts in the sustainability Arena to uh fellow uh uh folks within Maran County in addition to that uh strategic initiatives administrator uh Bobby Kidd also was a presenter at the uh Texas transit Leadership Institute uh this week um Trans Pro as you know who we partner with for Trans Dash and our strategic plan uh teaches a leadership uh course uh several times a year to uh Transit leaders in in uh Texas and uh yesterday uh Bobby was featured at a a presentation on our perspective on performance mindset and our strategic planning process over the last couple years uh so over 20 uh Transit leaders in Texas got to hear the Chariot story uh directly from above and uh we have at the level we do have a new speaker of the house so what that means for us is hopefully the transportation Housing andd Development bill will start to move forward uh for the uh fiscal year 24 Appropriations um earlier today I sent an emails letters of support to our Congressional uh delegations Transportation legislative AIDS uh encouraging support of the Senate's version of the transportation bill it's much more uh uh friendlier to the Community uh we hope that uh that uh Appropriations process at least for the tud bill will move uh in one of the first few bills to go through uh the process um in support of that I did send you an email earlier from the CFM uh uh DC staff with an update on what's been happening back in DC uh around the the speaker of the house uh elections uh and just to wrap up just a reminder uh we're entering the holiday season there in November there is only a work session which is scheduled for November 9th no board meeting and then in December there'll be no work session and a board meeting uh on December 14th and the second week and as opposed to our normal fourth week which is the holiday week so uh with that that concludes my report than thank you very much so that moves us into our board reports director Davidson do you have anything to report sure do um so um on the service enhancement committee nothing to report out just yet however the protective conversation we had at the board retreat will serve as the basis for a lot of the work that myself director Navaro and Director Holstrom will be initiating here shortly as we stand up that committee um as we Begin work on that we'll of course report back on uh developments there but as you saw from general manager Pollock's report out uh during the board retreat it's going to be a lot of work so um hope to have uh many reports yet to come on that um for uh not a whole lot to report out on from the Council of governments we did have a special board session board meeting a couple days ago but uh nothing too relevant here um I do want to highlight a couple things um that are tangentially related to chariots um the most uh I guess exciting is that the City of Salem was recently awarded quar million dollars to purchase a battery electric powered compact street sweeper which uh I imagine for most people sounds incredibly boring and I I would not begrudge them um why it is exciting however is because uh this is a piece of Maintenance equipment that will allow for the construction of protected bike Lanes across the city and so um as I think we are all keenly aware our bus riders as soon as they get off a bus they become either a pedestrian or a cyclist or rollerblader you know all these different modes of what many would call a vulnerable Transportation user and um so having safe infrastructure for them is significant and this has been the largest obstacle uh facing the city for key implementation of um um this kind of protection and so um it will be here in the spring I've heard rumors that there may even be a naming contest um so keep an eye out for that um and in a similar vein um the City of Salem is making substant substantial Headway on the Union Street familyfriendly Bikeway which will uh serve as a connection point from Commercial Street on out to Summer Street initially they have plans to make it wrap until 12th Street but um it's significant for a couple ways for us at chariots Union Street is the key conduit between West Salem and then Downtown Salem East Salem and well the rest of Salem um but it also will intersect with high and Church Street which are buffered bike lanes that connect with the downtown Transit Center and so U it's a key connection point for a lot of people there um and uh one thing that I'm most excited about is that on that section of Bikeway on winter and Union there's actually what I believe is the first of its kind in our region which is a so there's a it's a buffered bike lane and then we have a bus stop so the bus stop is pushed into the street a little and then the bike lane actually there's a ramp up and then it goes behind the bus stop uh and so there's protection there there's no you know kind of negative interaction occurring between a someone who's on a bike and a bus rider and so um it's wonderful I think it's gorgeous um I I would encourage you to stop on by take a look at it uh and then uh they have started striping Union Street the weather has delayed some of that but they hope to be substantively complete on the striping on Union Street at least that section by the end of the month and then the new on what is it commercial in Union I think will launch in November Liberty it's liberty thank you um and that's significant because right now if you're a cyclist you have to basically engage in a very high stakes game of Frogger to cross uh what is functionally a state highway it actually is a state highway um so yeah very exciting that's my report I just had a moment where I'm thinking like where's like the cut off point where people still know what Frogger is like I played Frogger and now I'm like as as anyway um complete deviation Director Holstrom do you have anything to report yeah uh thank you PR so um I did attend the um Community advisory committee meeting uh this last last week I guess it was um and uh had a good meeting there um there was a presentation from uh Kik Doan uh similar to the one that we had uh not too long ago on the um commuter options and group Pass Program that was so well received by the the advisory committee and then um uh also uh there was quite bit discussion on the uh some turnover uh that's going to be coming up here with some folks that are to the ends of their terms and then some folks that are applying to beond the committee so something we're going have to keep an eye for um there's going to be a few new faces on the advisory committee um there was quite a bit of uh you know updates from they lot of subcommittees on this uh on this advisory committee and so uh they had a lot of reports from that uh president as you know you you were able to come and and address the uh committee on on what we're up to as far as a board of directors and that was appreciated uh so thank you for that and um yeah that was those were the key points I think from that advisory committee of course um was happy to",

        "text": " before all of you were there we as a board we had to vote saying we need data I remember that we got five out of seven votes to say yes we need data from that stage of evolution to you're coming here I really see it's a very good direction and data is to me data when public has access to data and everybody has access to data in a transparent way to me that is equity because you can't have Equity without measurement and if you don't measure something you can't change it so this is good and uh I really look forward to see that one of the board goal was public facing data dashboard we had discussed under chair Carson Cottingham and so I wish to see just like the state of Georgia and others we develop we don't want to wait for the state to tell us let's develop a public facing data dashboard an interactive dashboard so that Community organizations advocacy organizations can have datadriven Equitable advocacy rather than just emotionally trying to make policies so thank you very much for coming here and uh helping us get to the next level you is there a motion to approve the consent calendar CH I would like to an okay don't forget your microphone chair if if you would allow me I would like to pull um Item B would you want just for a brief discussion appointment of legal counsil for 2425 is there a motion to approve the consent calender except Item B yes chair thank you is there a second second second second by two people okay I'll all in favor of the consent uh calendar agenda please raise your hand or say I I I I okay that's Anon Anonymous at this time um director Ashley cenam I give you the floor thank you chair um I just had a couple of questions I um in the contract it's it's a is that the school district is the client and I think this has come up almost every year when we approve this contract um but could you clarify Rebecca does that include the board yes the the board is the client they are the legal governing body of the district okay and can you just every time this comes up each year I have a little bit of heartburn around um how the firm and you and anyone you delegate to handles questions that may arise where there's disagreement perhaps between the board and the leadership of the district not that we want that to occur but just from like a legal lens it it appears almost like a conflict but I know that the firm probably has a way to resolve that conflict and could you just talk a little bit about that so that we're clear as a board sure so the board is the client and so if there were a conflict for example the superintendent evaluation or something like that where the the person that we're in contact with the most a superintendent or another member of the executive leadership team if there's a difference of opinion then in that case the board is would be the person that we're the person that would be the entity that we're advising so the there isn't because the board is who we are representing in terms of the entity we don't see a conflict is just in as we would uh work with any institution okay thank you dor can I ask a follow-up question on this uh so this is not a hypothetical situation so sometimes it does come up these are kind of very difficult moving parts so because you know there is a district and there sometimes the students and I AP program sometimes the board and the and then the board so in such cases would you be providing two separate legal representation from your firm to say when things like that come up want to represent the board and want to represent say the district or the uh so in in the case of something like that like a special education matter there would be not there would we would be representing the district and the board as as a whole and we would be advising you about the best way forward for the school district and the school district's liability so no we would not be establishing separate Council because if we were adverse then that they're it's kind of one and the same so you certainly can though and the board the the district has retained other councel in a lot of different matters this this appointment today is just from board operations b11 you need to name an attorney for the district but you regularly contract with other legal councils so it's it's a it's a possibility thank you thank you any other questions hey let's take a motion for the pulled item please yes yes I would like to to make a motion okay that we accept uh 6B okay and is there a second thank you director so it has been uh the motion has been made and it has been second uh I need all of you that are in favor to please no a discussion can we have a discussion yes we can have a discussion I I just want to say thank you very much uh uh Rebecca Johnson I really appreciate and I really thank you for working you know we went through very important discussions and this year was not easy uh by all means and uh and I really appreciate you helping us helping us think through some of the things I really appreciate your calm equanimous uh demeanor through all this and uh you have helped me and I am sure you my colleagues will agree so and thank you very much and uh I look forward to Future years at least the next two three years that you will help thanks he everyone that's in favor of Item B appointment of legal counsel for 2425 please raise your hand and say I hi hi all are in favor thank you at this time uh we'll hear from coo Bob Sila for our first reading of the multiple unit housing tax incentive program application good evening Cher Richardson uh board directors and superintendent tonight we have the first reading of a request from the City of Salem uh for a tax abatement under the multiple unit housing tax program uh you've most of you I believe have seen one of these before uh so this is just another one that's come through this is for a 105 unit development uh downtown of multiple uh unit housing uh which also includes because it's over 50 units it includes that 15% of the units will be available or designated as affordable housing uh at the 80% medium uh income level uh and since it is in the urban renewal area I'm getting a echo here sorry about that uh since it is in the urban renewal area the tax abatement does not impact school School District Revenue uh I did some research to find out why I've been saying that for the last two years that I've been doing these and what happens is when a urban renewal area is uh either created or expanded the tax base is Frozen at that point so no other uh improvements to the property or additional taxes uh go to the uh taxing jurisdictions of that area only the urb only the urban renewal area I'll try to talk quieter uh so again tonight's first reading uh city of Sal has passed the resolution and is asking for our support by passing a resolution uh to support the 10year tax rebate uh uh tax rebate for this developer so I I just have a fundamental question this has come up before so my reading I couldn't understand if there is a example like this where there is already it's not going to make a difference for us it's already there's a part of urban renewal then why do they keep bringing it to the school district is there any statute that says till the even then with the school district have to get involved yes yes since it's a tax abatement the uh 51% of the taxing jurisdictions have to approve by resolution so in the City of Salem both the city as well as the school district make up 52% of the taxing jurisdictions so uh historical practice has been City of Salem passes resolution uh under the Salem Revised Code as well as Oregon sta statute uh that allows for the rebate with the majority of taxing jurisdictions so how was this tax abatement who decided that in the beginning that this region will be tax abatement did we have a say in that or is just a city decided that uh it's part of the city's urban renewal uh development plan do we have a say in that particular dis decision yes by bringing this back for Action uh that's when you have your say uh whether or not to authorize the abatement that's not my question the question is when a certain area is designated as tax abatement just like you're saying that is decided by the city when it comes to but they bringing it after the fact so who decided which area will be tax abatement zone or whatever it can I try yeah somebody can explain that if I'm understanding your question correctly are you asking who decides an urban renewal area correct okay City of Salem decides the urban renewal and we don't have a say in deci in that decision no we do not well that doesn't make any sense to me well I mean the they need to bring it down if they need to get rid of it so that the city can have tax or they need to do something but they keep bringing it up where whatever we decide makes no difference well the urban renewal area is certain areas in the City of Salem to revitalize the area so I mean they give certain incentives in this case like a property tax abatement to build more housing to move your business there but that pot of money that as as our chief operations officer has mentioned it's like an additional pot of money it doesn't go to the general fund of operations of the City of Salem the only thing that that money is used for is to create additional incentives so essentially what they're doing is that they created this pot of money to revitalize the area somebody comes in they want a property tax abatement and what they're doing is just not adding funds into to their Urban fund pot of money that's what I'm thinking like a scheme and can I add something yeah so I think the way that the the district then can influence though this board has already done so in that we didn't get to make the original decision around the urban renewal District but there's a check and balance in place for the taxing districts to say yes or no to whether property tax ta will be Abad for that period so it does delegate some authority to the other taxing districts to weigh in and so I'll just say I'm grateful the last one of the last times this particular developer came forward um they were not going to be setting aside as",

        "text": " there was existing building. They put a maximum floor to area ratio of one that's higher than what we need. Right. We've got the existing building plus another proposed 60,000. And quite honestly, I asked for the extra two extra buildings that we're not building at this time, but we wanted room for growth that we didn't have to come back in and modify the pud. All right, so nothing. So what is that? 75,000, 100,000, something like that? I think it was. I think it was like 80, 85,000. But if you include the house, I mean, it may be a hair. Let's do 100,000 square foot. Okay. That's the limiting maximum. Yeah. And then, I mean, because that's a lot for that property. And most of what they need is outside storage, I think so. That takes care of everything, right? I believe so. So is that going to be strictly for the structures? Because the pud. The outside storage itself is well over 100,000 structures. Okay. Because the outside storage was like 150,000 least, right? Yeah, yeah. So that's fine. And we can. You need something different. Oh, you can't talk from. I'm sorry, you'll have to come up. Yeah, he's. He'll have to say, go ahead. Go on. But you gotta come down here. Step away from the microphone. Y'all can go talk. David. Commissioners. Can I clarify? Is outdoor storage subject to the setback? No, it was the buildings. Just the buildings? Yes. Where the paint and body were. The paint and. Yeah, the outside storage. Outside of that. That buffer, which obviously makes sense. Hours. Commissioners, do you want to go to the six to five, just across the board. Okay. Through Saturday. They only operate five days a week. Friday through Friday. I don't know where. I cannot find it somewhere. I didn't hallucinate it, but anyway, it was. It was through Saturday. But that's not six through five. Monday through Friday. Okay, that's fine. Just to jump back to the sidewalk. That's what I was going to go next. So with the development that's going to be developing around it, that's only on the north side. Right. So you've only got. I mean, it really. It butts up to the back of this wraps around, and then there's a small piece that comes up north of there. And I. And I think realistically, when I asked to do a covenant or a fee in lieu of. To me, that's in benefit of the county. You don't want me to build a sidewalk out there today that 20 years from now, you connect a brand new sidewalk to. And this one's all broken up, and then you wind up having to tear it out and replace it. And it was never used in the first place. Place. So it makes sense to either do a covenant and say, hey, you build it when we ask you to build it, or you pay the fee and we build it. Most of the time you're paying it. And then we're using that sidewalk fund to somewhere. Sidewalks by the schools. Right. And this is this. And this benefits the county as a whole. It should be a criteria. Every time you write one of these things. If you want to sidewalk that, it should be able to pay the fee instead of. So for this type of youth commissioner, pay in lieu would be the most appropriate, right? That'd be the most they prefer. That's what Monier wants. It's not what I want. Last but not least, I just want to make sure that we have it on the record that the uses that this be for is applicable to the use that they're asking for. I want that in the record. So our just to make sure that we're covering all bases there, we said before, including paint, metal fabrication and outside storage, to ensure that if something was missing from that or isn't exactly worded like that with only a development code, it is. It is clearly. Okay. So they. Yes. So they clarified it with that. Thank you. Metal fabrication, which included. Very good. I think I might have anything else. Yeah, no, that's fine. I just want to make sure that all that works for you guys and that's fine. Yes, sir. Anything else you all need? I do have one more just to clarify. Number ten. All paint and body work activities shall be within an enclosed building. And we said something about final touch ups or something like that. Prep work and touch up work may occur outside minor prep. Minor, minor prep. Minor prep. Okay, thank you. All right. So, Kathleen, can you read back everything so that we have everything listed correctly? Okay. Deep up. Loudly. Yes. So, number one, Pud shall comply with the Pud development setbacks as listed. 40ft for what we're going to consider the front property line, 20 from the rear, ten from the sides. The pud shall comply with the Pud development buffers listed in table three below. North, south and east property lines will have a double stagger row of viburnum, heavily vegetated with at 8ft by five years and 10ft. Ten foot height to be maintained in perpetuity by the property owner. Oh, I forgot to add in a ten foot width. That as well, and to create opaque screening. Let's see. Number three. All structures in which paint, paintwork, bodywork or metal fabrication are taking place must be at a minimum 50ft from all property lines. Number four, all outside storage areas must be beside or behind the structure fronting on northeast Jacksonville Road. And at a minimum, we should be changing that, I believe, to the 50ft as well. It's 100ft currently, if that's okay. From the right of way property line, all outside storage areas shall be screened, buffered or fenced in such a manner as to screen said areas from view from access streets, freeways and incompatible adjacent properties. Such screenings shall form a complete opaque screen up to a .8ft in vertical height, as is consistent with commercial and industrial screening. And buffering. Does that conflict with the 10ft that we're going to in perpetuity? That would be my question. Did we want to? But I think that this would be intense. That was just. I mean, 8ft is a minimum and that's like, out on 301 or on. And the other ten is clarified somewhere else. So I think this is okay to leave. I don't have any confusion about it. So let's see. Number six, trying to figure out how to a sidewalk shall be provided, or payment in lieu of sidewalk. Payment in lieu. Payment in lieu. So, payment in lieu of sidewalk. So we'll just leave that as is. Number seven. PUD shall be limited to those uses permitted in regional business before zoning classification, including paint and body metal fabrication and outside storage. Number eight. The PUD shall be developed consistent with the PUD plan and the development conditions provided in the event and alternative use other than those listed individually or within the b four zoning classification. As proposed, the site shall go through the PUD rezoning application process to ensure due public notice is provided. Number nine. Operating hours shall be 06:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m. monday through Friday. All activity will cease outside of these permitted times. Number ten. All paint and bodywork activities shall be within an enclosed building with the exception of minor prep and touch up which can take place outside. Number eleven. The PUD height and floor area ratio development standards shall be maximum building heights of 50ft and a maximum floor area ratio of one. We were going to change that to a max building square. Oh, that was number twelve. Development of the PUD's building related to setbacks and building separation shall conform to the PUD's development standards and applicable building codes and fire safety codes. Number 13. The PUD site must comply with the county's land development code. Lighting standards that require lighting be shielded so as not to direct lighting off site and a photometric plan shall be provided during the major site plan review to ensure no negative impacts to neighboring parcels. Number 14. The final PUD master plan or equivalent shall require approval by the Marion County Board of county Commissioners, including being dually noticed and advertised consistent with the LDC notice provisions and at the applicant's expense. And number. I think you all should get rid of that one because y'all don't like. It was a good try. And number 15. If PUD is approved, the special use permit granted shall be rescinded upon date of PUD approval, which is January 10, 2024. It does include the existing. Yes, Tracy. Commissioners. Tracy. Straub. Assistant county administrator. The PD currently being. The SUP currently being rescinded. We talked at the beginning of the meeting the need for the buffer to be established because of the current activities at an earlier date than a later date where we're going to put a time period on that buffer being planted. You're saying because the one for the sup wasn't done? Correct. We could do something like a recommendation of installation within six months. It is. We're gonna work on that right away anyway. Six months is plenty, but you gotta think about what season you might have to order it. You might have to wait a couple months. Yeah, we're in. So six months enough time? Yeah, I believe that'll get us into",

        "text": " the scoring criteria information provided in the application will also be used in the construction of the performance agreement between successful applicants and Odo so thank you for joining today and um we'd be happy to answer any questions um also on the site there is a link to the program webpage and the program thanks so much James again if you hadn't had the opportunity to put your name and affiliation in the chat that would be really great for you to add that let us know who you are I'm gonna go to a question that I was so this is on the topic of Partnerships and coverage of benefits for the identified regions from Greg and they ask concerns with agencies having limited reach within a district or within a regional boundary so where a county is only one of a few within a region utility might be reluctant to apply um because they don't cover the whole um so I think this raises the really important topic about Partnerships and collaboration to provide to the regions what else can you offer James on that yeah I think that's just a great point uh the I would encourage Partnerships to kind of cover the that additional area in a region that isn't covered by the surface area of the applicant organization again in in the Bell uh it specifically called out utilities um we would need to partner within a region if there's areas that weren't covered by their service area or there is the the option of that that alternative boundary um but because we're trying to to maximize the benefits to uh to spread across the state where have those kind of requirements around adjusting of those boundaries because we don't want to have those little pockets or holes of lack of coverage so I think uh yeah that kind of um encourage people to reach out to discuss potential uh Partnerships in in their area um here we've got a couple of new ones that have come in will Auto announce um all of the entities that applied per that is something uh we can follow up with after the uh webinar once I can't get that confirmed um and we can make sure that's in the the FAQ document that we'll uh put out great thank you so related the next question is will the public be able to know which these plan to apply for program dollars so that members of the public can provide input prior to application submission Okay so sorry could you uh repeat that one yep so this is about public input rather than Partnerships um will the public be able to know which entities plan to apply for program dollars so that they can provide input prior to application submission um so I guess that's up to the the applicant if they wish to solicit uh some some support from their communities uh um Community groups in their region there will be an opportunity to kind of uh upload supporting documents so I think I think that would be something that applicants could kind of solicit uh within their their a question on alternative boundaries um from Thomas if there's a lack of appetite from your identified regions for partners can a utility request a modified area in the region yeah that's a good question and I believe they should be able to I'm just kind of double checking I didn't I don't think there's any kind requirement that their that they utilities couldn't propose an alternative boundary I believe they they should be able to but I will dive back into the the rules just to kind of double check that and we can uh confirm that uh as well afterwards but I don't think there's a barrier but I will want to kind of just double check that Thanks James and a reminder to everybody that with the Q a document we'll be sure to fill in any gaps that um we weren't able to answer live today including offering contacts to other organizations that might have better information such as Energy Trust Thomas had a follow-up question I think the question is it's about coordination with Partners in the region would I think it would Odo be willing to facilitate that coordination with other partners um so where it is kind of a competitive application process and so uh we'll need to comply with our procurement processes but we have heard some people some potential applicants about the concept of trying to help people uh find Partners within a region and so we're um what assistance we can provide but if anybody has any thoughts or suggestions feel free to drop them in the chat or drop them in an email to the the mailbox and we can certainly explore them as well Thanks James and Catherine added interest in that question as well thank you Catherine um uh as well as Greg um so let's see I've got a question on applicant eligibility um Garrett asks when will homeowners be able to apply for rebates um in other words when is it expected that I can tell customers to apply yeah so there's the there'll be an award notification but um there is like the performance viewing process after that award notification um where we can compiling the the performance agreement and both parties will want to review before um and then at that point um it's kind of up to the the grantee of when they want to kind of start to their communities that they will be accepting applications or addressing um so that'll be up to the individual grantees of whether they want to start that early and start Gathering interest or whether they want to wait until their program is fully up and running uh kind of I think it's going to be a region by region grantee by grantee decision right so perhaps a small amount of clarification is that the grants being awarded by Odo go to the regional entity that then that regional administrator determines the process for Distributing these incentive funds out to the public and to homeowners um thanks everybody for these great Laura asks are there any requirements for data collection oh you're welcome to add additional detail to that question of Laura so I'm thinking you're asking about um maybe reporting requirements okay so yeah there is uh reporting requirements in the the Bell about uh reports that will need to be submitted to uh their own Department of energy on an annual basis which are going to be more detailed uh than uh some the the more regular update reports so uh kind of will be an annual report there'll be like a bigger one that has detailed description of the entities use of the funds a list of like each each loan or Grant of financial assistance uh that provided um and then kind of nature of any administrative expenses and marketing um as well as any other information and they'll be we have us outlining the rules as well and then those kind of more regular update reports uh throughout the year won't need to kind of list out every specific uh it'll just kind of be a slightly different requirement um that won't be as big as the the annual reports and that'll all be kind of detailed out in the performance agreement and I'm just gonna check if there's more details that I can provide as well so there'll be kind of records of uh inspections uh that uh required as well in the rules regarding record keeping and Reporting uh will provide more detail for that great thank you um and I just wanted to thank everyone in the chat for adding additional context and experiences around finding Regional administrators and partners in the qualified regions um helpful context for figuring out how to support um those Partnerships um I don't know that we have any other questions at this time um I'm standing here to make sure I'm not missing anything and if there's any follow-up questions or clarification on earlier answers provided please feel free to put those in the chat as well um we've got some additional time still to answer questions and write information oh uh I do have a question on when the next FAQ will come out with more insight we'll be looking to kind of follow up questions any kind of confirms uh confirmation that we said we'd kind of follow up with in the next week or two um there is Uh current FAQ on the website now that we followed up with from the the last uh the webinar we did um and we'll look to kind of find an update with questions on this one and so I expect in the next week or two and then we'll be looking as uh the opportunity announcement continues we're looking to kind of update that pretty um as well going through until the questions the final questions um I can pull that up on my so uh which is not just posted will be the end of the month so we looked at kind of publish uh any updated FAQs fairly regularly up until great thanks everyone for everybody that Kayla added the link to the current FAQs um in the chat getting thanks Carrie for additional um comment on the partner coordination we have we have talked about that um there's a question about the the boundary definition um yeah I think those align with the economic districts or whatever right yes uh so that um was established in the legislation um and uh aligns around the economic development districts in the state thank you um so right Carrie is asking for a recap Regional coordination plans around that and opportunities tools sure I can just recap what we covered earlier that this is kind of a competitive process uh we'll have to follow uh procurement processes um but we've heard definitely heard like an interest in people wanting to kind of be have that process uh finding a partner facilitated um and um we're kind of exploring up what options are available to us but if people have suggestions I appreciate there's been a couple I think I've been dropped in the chat already people ask suggestions feel free to drop them in the chat or to emails and we can continue to explore and see see what we what we can offer so just kind of wanted to look back to the question about utilities proposing alternative boundaries and uh in the pause between questions I was able to kind of skim through and double check that there isn't any kind of restriction on on that so uh utilities would be able um kind of propose those alternative but again if there's they are closing bandages that are outside there um service area we need to partner for that area of the region and again any alternative boundaries would need to kind of meet those requirements for alternative boundaries because one of the aims is two of the the program is to kind of maximize the the coverage across the state um I wanted to thank Catherine added uh an idea in the chat we welcome those entity to cover more than one region if we can get a larger entity it could be an administrator um so that would kind of uh fall into that kind of alternative boundary proposal um so if you you can only apply for the region kind of one of the criteria is you can only apply for the region that has the most uh people you serve in and so if you're",

for you also around the wheeling so um can you just explain why you um let's see why you're wheeling to pacific core is it was cec un willing to sign a contract for the power or did did you get a better rate through pacific core um no it's it's not that it's the the co-op doesn't have any ability to incentivize the project um the way the investor-owned utilities do through uh energy trust of oregon so without energy trust of oregon uh these projects would never happen okay thanks and then you also were throwing out the numbers on the revenues and then the cost of the wheeling charges what what percentage of your revenues were consumed by it's roughly uh you know 33 to 40 percent in a drought year it's over 50 okay thank you fascinating okay thank you so much and then looks like dave put his hand down thanks dave i mean i would have loved to hear from you but yes we should move on given that we lost time earlier already thank you so much um mark we really appreciate having you

have questions and put them in the chat i'm happy to email them to mark and share the answers with the whole group so feel free to be great happy happy to answer any questions and and thank you everybody appreciate the good work you all are doing and i wish you all super luck and happy to be of any help in the future yeah congratulations with the big ribbon cutting coming up that's clearly a milestone so thank you all right all righty would you like to introduce our next person yes um next we have rafaela from bonneville environmental foundation and rafael just tell me when you want to next slide and i will click through as you present great thanks so much stephanie hi everyone i'm rafael sue flanders um i'm the renewables program manager at bonneville environmental foundation and i'm going to share a little bit about our community scale renewable energy project development work um i'll start with just kind of a high level overview for those of you who might not be as familiar with bef and our work so you can go to the next slide so bef uh we are a 501c3 nonprofit we're based out of portland but um our renewables team works regionally um other teams in our organization work nationally and internationally um and we work at the intersection of carbon energy and water so we have a water team that's kind of focused on habitat restoration work we have a k-12 renewable energy education team um and they focus on integrating renewable energy curriculum into classrooms we've got our team which i'll talk about more were project pretty project focused um in the pacific northwest on a few different renewable technologies and then we have a team that's focused on selling wrecks offsets and wrc's water restoration certificates uh to companies uh who are looking to offset their so you can go to the next slide so our renewables team um we are only three people at the moment um so you know we have to kind of be limited in scope but we're focused on developing projects that deliver direct economic benefits to primarily low-income and tribal communities throughout the pacific northwest um we work mostly in solar renewable hydrogen and electric vehicles um and i'm just going to be talking about solar for the sake of today's conversation since that's what my work focuses on um but we work with several different stakeholders we are our work is rooted in partnership so a lot of our day-to-day work is just building relationships with stakeholders which have you know kind of examples of the types of stakeholders that i've listed on the left and bringing people together to identify what community stated needs are and how we can provide technical assistance financial assistance project development assistance to help meet those needs of the communities that we're trying to serve and what that ends up looking like is um everything in the the right hand you know providing all kinds of support from grant writing um to financial modeling rfp development everything from kind of the ideation stage of a project all the way through um installation and then you know into the future we try to build long-term relationships with our partners and help them with subsequent projects and and follow up so you can go to the next slide so for today's conversation i'm just going to talk about a couple projects as examples of the community scale work that we do um we you know we we work on some community solar projects in portland we you know do some projects with school districts some with utilities stuck with tribes so um you know there's quite a variety i'll just be talking about a couple um but we worked with the quinault indian nation last year on a project it was their first solar project um and we had had a relationship with them for a few years um but you know due to capacity and timing things kind of came together uh in 2021 so it was a 24 kilowatt uh project it was on their community center in queens um and the quinault is pretty remotely located in general they're at the end of a transmission line they experience frequent power outages so one thing that became apparent was um the need for and the desire for battery storage and resilience um so we incorporated battery storage and backup into the project um and we worked with the tribe at their tribal employment rights office to integrate workforce development opportunities so the picture that you can see in the top right is of some we had from four different companies volunteer their time so we had four different contractors represented on this project and they were volunteering their time on the roof training when all community members on how to install panels and we also followed up with training from solar energy international so there were some classroom hours that these community members were able to participate in so we really wanted to provide an opportunity since there isn't a lot of economic opportunity and job opportunities on the reservation but there are a lot of folks interested in pursuing careers in renewable energy we wanted to give them some of the skills and knowledge to maybe kickstart that and so the project itself is generating at least over two thousand dollars a year annually um in electricity bill savings for the tribe um and then we also brought in our team that i mentioned previously that focuses on k-12 12 renewable energy education and they're working with the school district kind of using the project as a hands-on learning opportunity um so there's a link if anyone's curious to a video kind of recapping that project but you can go to the next slide so a different project just to kind of illustrate some of the differences um another project we worked on last year was with the blackfeet nation in montana and i know neither of these are oregon projects um but our goal i would say as a whole as a team is to kind of create and develop replicable models um you know partnership models financial models and kind of just project models in general um and so i think that you know there are elements of both of these projects that are transferable and that we're trying to kind of retain and replicate in oregon projects and a lot of that has to do with just you know the way that we're forming partnerships and the way that we're kind of trying to pair pv installations with workforce development opportunities um that continue on into the future so the blackfeet project was another example of this we had again had a relationship with them for several years and it was a very multifaceted project we partnered with the community college and did four installations on the community college campus on rooftops and then we also partnered with the k-12 school and did a ground-mounted community solar system on the school campus um and that was virtually net metered so the utility um glacier electric co-op was terrific and incredibly supportive and they have been managing subscriptions they did a first come first serve kind of lottery system to give subscriptions to community members in heartbutte so those community members are now receiving discounts on their electricity bill individually and then on this project we also partnered with grid alternatives which is the nation's leading nonprofit solar installer and they have a very robust tribal program and they specialize in workforce training and so they're pictured in both of these photos on the roof and on the ground training blackfeet community members and i think several of them actually ended up continuing on to get jobs at grid on the tribal team so kind of a similar pairing of workforce development and an installation um and this was just because this was a much bigger system than the canal it's generating a lot more over 17 000 um dollars a year in savings um and and then we similarly uh we actually selected our ce team that focuses on education selected one particular stem educator at the heartbeat school on the reservation and selected her as a clean energy fellow and she essentially got to kind of work alongside uh the development of this project with her students and the students got to do different projects um as the installation was moving forward i'll stop there because i know it's uh was a lot of information but these are just kind of examples um of the types of work we do right now you know our work is um we're still working on a lot of tribal projects um but with the recent portland clean energy fund awards um and the community renewable energy grant program we do also have a lot of projects that we're focused on in portland and in oregon so happy to uh answer any that people might have thank you all thanks rob good to see you too yeah thanks uh the community solar project you said that the local electric co-op is providing bill saving is doing the transaction on the customer's bill were they already doing that under kind of a structured community solar program offering and this was just one of the projects or did they actually start doing that for this project i find that remarkable they started doing that for this project which is you know one of the reasons why glacier electric co-op that go up um out there was just terrific and you know we we have relationships with utilities throughout the region and",

        "text": " on our state ledge agenda but I think we need to think about uh getting evangelizing the need with our Congressional reps that's all Point well taken chair we'll work to address that in the federal agenda and then um I'm not sure where to do this which is why I just left it at the end there are two things that I think about three actually when I look at my detail notes Here I think we need to be brave and articulate to the Washington County caucus that we need them to fund state agencies to do foundational work you know in meeting with the dlcd director this week uh there's some foundational work that they need to do to modernize things move away from paper for example and they need the funding to do that uh so in some ways they're stealing from Peter to pay Paul just like we have done for decades but they're down to the bone just like we are so and our work with them relies upon that information so I think we need to advoc this is not so much our priorities necessarily but advocacy that we can do to support the other is I'm grateful that Clackamus County chair toy Smith engraved this on my forehead three years ago and so every year when we talk about legislative priorities I bring it up no more mandates we say that really politely so moving from the polite to the direct no more unfunded mandates thank you very much no boor unfunded or partially funded there you go bingo I like that even better well that was my full full my third budget uh my third bullet item fund existing so but it's more crisp no more funded no more underfunded so that's it from me next steps thank you for that great feedback chair um next steps we want to just provide a snapshot of this of the calendar what we're going to be looking at I'm not going to call out every item but you know August is very important for us we're going to uh revise the proposed agenda and be engaging with legislators on these potential legislative Concepts um and just continuing these important uh conversations to build the required coalitions um in September we have a few things itemized but we are uh looking forward to uh legislative days on um the 23rd to the 25th uh we're also going to be doing a work session with the county and clean water services uh to draft the agenda and flagging that the bill request deadline is at the end of September as we've as we've discussed um I'd like to take the opportunity right now to add something else to the possible schedule in September um your government relations team has been analyzing the capital Improvement plan and exploring a state funding request in addition to the courthouse we while we are in the early stages of our analysis and considering what is possible based on historic Christmas tree bills we want to socialize this concept with with you for your consideration we plan to continue engaging with subject matter experts and work off of your adopted uh Capital Improvement plan to bring back a recommendation to you in September of what a proposed project could look like um but I will speak for the team that we certainly want to be thoughtful and also aggressive in our funding ask for the county and not leave any money on the table cities do it all the time so I think it's something for us to consider thank you for the idea thank you chair and then the last slide is just the interm calendar which um we love to include just for your reference again just highlighting some of those important dates that we'll be working towards and also bringing information back to you so this year they don't have ledge days that conflict with the AOC great I believe that's very correct and positive change yeah terrific are there any questions that we can answer Commissioners good job team go team go thank you for your time thank you alrighty we have one more topic board and Leadership communication and formal agenda discussion first why don't we check in on the letters the first we have a urban growth report comment letter that has been proposed to us I assume we've all had the opportunity to review these letters are you thumbs up in supporting the city of Sherwood expansion in the UGL and moving forward yep okay great the Hillsboro TGM Grant item on Cornell Road Great and King City is also applying for a TGM Grant with regard to the Westside Trail oky doie great now um actually why don't we do leadership communication first yes Miss CH uh before you move on to leadership um communication I do want to mention there is one letter that was not included in your packet that I just received in the last um hour and that is a letter recognizing the third annual report on Washington County's use of arpa funds when we submit the port report we need a letter from the board U Miss McKim is grabbing a hard copy of that letter okay since you haven't had time to review it um us the high points okay the high points is you're accepting the letter um and the County's distribution of arpa funds this is the pro forma report and so we're really we just need a signature we're gonna get a we're gonna see a draft you're GNA see a draft and you can exp concerns okay and there she is like clockwork didn't we also have from yeah CD that's on the list it's in here where last one m''s favorite topic oh I didn't whatever I you are correct Madam chair you didn't that one thumbs up and that's on the home I know I read it you've already read it it's um it's really they're in budget right now at the federal level and this is our opportunity to influence uh consideration yeah thumbs up me too and commissioner Rogers there's your copy this is the one that Miss Angie was just uh referring to we approved the the framework it's noting that um highlighting the status of all of our different areas and making sure that we provide the appropriate submitt yeah if you're good with it yeah you bet um I will get um this information to the clerk to be posted in the packet so it's publicly available terrific okay leadership communication which of you would like to first I'll go first chair Harrington Board of Commissioners um I have a number of legal updates that I'm going to share with you in our next scheduled time so I'm just going to use this time to briefly let you know that I will be on vacation the remainder of this week uh Deputy County Council Jason Bush will be acting for the remainder of the week he is on site for um during normal business hours and I did share your his cell phone with you all should you need him um I will be getting some nature therapy so don't think that I will be um have reliable connection or self go on vacation and leave your work phone behind or is bathing approved yes yes so looking forward to getting away with my family um I also wanted to just take a moment to let you know that next week since we won't be together next week um in this uh Forum that several of the County Council will be attending the Oregon Association of County Council conference at shahan um as in years past Washington County has been tapped to do a lot of the presenting and teaching to our peers this continues to be a trend so I just want to um thank County Council um our our team for taking that on uh Rob bouette and Audriana Ortega will both be presenting and also just want to remind you that Kim Stewart also taught a couple weeks ago at the Oregon law enforcement records association annual conference so we continue to be out there um representing Washington County well oh and I might get on top of um commissioner Willie here but the fair starts Friday so hopefully everyone gets a chance to get out there good afternoon um so first I would like to start out with some sad news uh to pass along relative to the recent um heat event uh Washington county is now at four deaths that our medical uh examiner office suspects were four uh related to the recent Heat Wave the youngest person who passed was 73 and the oldest person was 87 all of these deaths occurred within urbanized areas of Washington County the medical examiner was able to determine that three of the four individuals had no air conditioning within their homes the fatalities that were suspected to be caused by the heat just underscore the need for each of us to be aware of unique needs that our neighbors have during significant weather events such as we've experienced I'll repeat what I said last week about how our multi- agency response to the heat wave over the 4th of July deserves credit for mitigating the impact of this extreme weather event yet I don't want to underscore the loss our community and those families that felt can I ask a uh and I am in no way trying to uh find out the particulars of these individuals rather I'm trying to identify um if their place of residence was uh public housing affordable housing private market rate housing whether it's apartments or houses um so and so my reason I I'm wondering if we could if if staff could have the benefit of that knowledge so that staff can look at are there additional Outreach efforts we should be making to promote the Medicaid supported air conditioning units or other senior uh programs for outreach um some of that information we don't have fully yet so I will take that as a um action item to follow up with your board H um I know last year your board had expressed um the desire and direction to staff to help push out that availability for services I will say um just last week reported to your board we have seen an increase in our overnight cooling shelter so that is good um it doesn't speak to the sad news I just shared but we need to keep pushing out that information to our community both on that short-term relief valve of an overnight cooling shelter but also um additional um means of safety for a community so looking ahead um the weather forecast calls for continued hot and dry weather including today's predicted high temperature of 97 here in Hillsboro thankfully temperatures are expected to cool off during the evenings we're also being dilligent about potential fire-prone weather in the days ahead as if to underscore this point the National Weather Service just issued a Red Flag Warning earlier this afternoon due to the low humidity and chance for gusting winds and thunderstorms tonight you will see an update um from our amazing emergency manager John Wheeler and the emergency management team of course are paying attention to the conditions this reminds me of you know the Heatwave of last week plus high temperatures",

        "text": " language the project is located on seated lands of confederated tribes of the Warm Springs and the name pays homage to the rich history and stewardship of Warm Springs and yella thank you for that Mr secretary for the record Todd cornet just couple of um kind of notes on this um I'm no expert on this but my understanding is we probably will never see goats use um goats jump on things and eat things um like wires and others so it's it's not likely that we're going to see goats used um in these sort of confined areas I think they would likely be too damaging so it probably will be limited to sheep um and obviously we'll see how that works um one other note I think that's probably important is you know and I think this you know the concept is great you know if we can have these sites not use herbicides and pesticides you know that would be um great you know so the point to try to keep you know for Wildfire purposes for um you know weed proliferation purposes um but I also want to make sure that council's sort of understanding there probably is another benefit which is I think just about every single solar project being proposed um has bifacial panels so it gets direct sunlight from the Sun but it also gets light bounce from below and you know I I I'm certainly no expert and I don't know what how efficient that bottom side is but maintaining keeping that vegetation so that there is good light bounce from the bottom means that they're going to produce more power so there's probably a side benefit here as well that they're interested in thank you and then just you know Council M choc's comment and we we we completely agree with that that you know we have to be 100% sure or as sure as we can be you know with all the information on the record you know that there won't be potentially any impacts to to known culture resources so it's good comment and we agree with that too all right well thank you Sarah so that gets us to our Council options and after hearing what council member chak toot said um I don't know how one goes about keeping that in mind yeah um because it's this project has gone through the permitting process um and preconstruction validation surveys there were no cultural resources and the site itself has not been designated as a um historic property of religious and uh cultural significance Indian tribes a hippers sit so I think we're covered for this site but definitely something we would keep in mind in the future council member chaku does that satisfy your concern yes ma'am that tells me that uh there has been 100% cultural resource surveys done yes all right thank you had they even had um a tribal monitor on site during construction as well perfect thank you so would anyone like to make a motion and I see Vice chair how giveing me the look Adam chair I move that the council approved the proposed changes to the I think it's the patchway wit uh solar facility noxious weed plan and fire safety plan to allow use of sheep at the facility for weed and vegetation management as presented and recommended by staff thank you anyone wish to make a second the record this Perry talk to I'll second it thank you we have a second from councilor member chaku any further concern or conversation council member Condon hi just a a question I think I heard you say um I think I heard you say that the Sheep were not intended for noxious weed control but vegetation management and so is that vegetation management piece under the noxious weed can uh the noxious weed plan yeah I mean I think it's intended to do both but it's really like 6040 benefit because um they don't just eat weeds uh okay but because the noxious weed plan has a plan for herbicide treatment that that this allows for a reduction in that approach okay I thank you I thought I understood that it wasn't intended for noxious speed so I was questioning okay so what about the noxious feed but now I understand both thank you and the wild right okay well thank you we have our motion we have a second Mr secretary please call the role Perry choc toot yes Richard yes how yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes Anne berer yes Katie IMS yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary Sarah thank you very much for uh presenting that even with your voice hope it feels better soon well we have reached the end of our agenda is there anyone uh anything anyone wishes to bring up before we begin to close out our meeting Madam chair um yes sir can I ask that Todd calls me after this meeting and it has nothing to do with this meeting and we're gonna get you to repeat that Nancy's working a little bit so one second please okay will you say that again please okay can Todd the secretary call me after this meeting it has nothing to do with this meeting has to do with HP 4090 yep saw your email I I will call you probably like in the next hour or so uh council member Devin okay thank you all right well as always thank you to staff for all the work that you do to prepare us uh to get through our meetings appreciate everything and I look at before you close the meeting yes sir I'd just like to say thank you for your gracious nomination and Leadership for the past I don't know how many years have you been chair three or I don't know thank you for your leadership it's going to be hard shoes to fill I can't fill them so keep me straight As we go down uh the road anyway thanks thank you um thank you CH thank you oh thank you uh well the beauty of it is I'm I'm just gonna be a member again I'm not going away I think sort of historically people have been chair and they they go away so I'll still be here uh unless something weird happens at work but it's been uh it's been fun and I appreciate everyone and look forward to uh working with you uh and Cindy and your new roles so with that the time is now I've struggled with the clock all day today it is now 1116 and the February 23rd 2024 meeting of

        "text": " Landscapes not on the a Landscapes the a Landscapes are pretty pretty well protected that would include places like The kumia Gorge National Scenic area however we get encroachment on the boundaries of the scenic area and within the viewshed of the scenic area uh there are projects that have placed wind turbines for example you know right on the boundary of the national Scenic area where they're in Clear View From Within the national Scenic area so the kind of inventory that I'm suggesting is not endless it's not timec consuming uh and it's not without and and I don't think I actually think it would facilitate development of renewable energy in Oregon as opposed to making it more difficult and the reason is because it would set out clear standards a Landscapes you wouldn't build in those everybody knows that already you're not going to build a uh wind energy project or solar energy project on the slopes of Mount Hood for example uh B sea Landscapes should be given more or less a green light from a Scenic standpoint so if we had a good inventory is a sea landscape uh then you you're not going to have much uh opposition based on scenery and legally uh you could probably find ways to uh prevent that and then be Landscapes are are these inet and we have a lot of these in Oregon where they are Scenic uh there's a big project right now that's proposed down in the Christmas Valley it's uh big solar energy project Christmas Valley in my view is scenic but it's not an a it's more of a b scenery and it needs some consideration to make sure that it's not lost uh but uh it shouldn't be just an Open Door like the sea Landscapes would be so uh I I think I think there's ways to do this I don't think it'd be all that difficult um and I think it's very important to do thanks thanks de um great well thank you all for the conversation on this um I think as I mentioned at the beginning you know our goal is to really be able to be a little more agile uh to be able to adapt to to things while uh not creating a super amount of uncertainty for a developer so if there is uh some methodology that we can use to you know um address things uh create create this inventory or or easily uh identify import enic resources that aren't already identified in a plan um we will definitely try to incorporate that at least in our um analysis and and see if we can come up with a good recommendation that strikes that balance um but since we have about 12 minutes left in our schedule time and um I want to be respectful of that to everybody let's move on to um our Recreation opportunities um thing and uh issue and I think this is actually Dove Tales nicely with some of the things that we just talked about um but whereas the scenic resources standard is based on those Land Management plans and and inventories already created in those Land Management plans the recreation opportunity standard is more open in its criteria based um and so uh in the application the applicant must identify all Recreation opportunities and then must provide an assessment of which opportunities are important based on a set of five criteria and the council has the ability to agree or disagree with that assessment um and those five criteria are whether or not there's any special designation or management of the location uh the degree of demand for the recreation opportunity any outstanding or unusual qualities the availability or rareness of the opportunity um in that area and the ear replace price ability or IR retrievability at the opportunity so whether or not the development of an energy facility would be a um permanent um permanent impact um as well as one that would be um not not able to be mitigated in some way um these criteria I Believe come from similar language in the land use planning goals um or at least uh from the oars from that that Land Development and uh land conservation and development commission has adopted um and we had a stakeholder ask if um these criteria were clear or not um or or basically recommend that they they needed to be more clear so I think that um we just like to hear any uh input people have on these criteria and unfortunately I messed up my slide here so um I guess I just like to hear any general impact on these criteria whether there should be some different process rather than a general uh inventory and um assessment of importance um or whether this criteria this this approach might be appropriate for the senior gr Services standard which kind of seems to be somewhat what um was being suggested although it sounds like there is a more um defined sense of what is the scenic resource ver a recreation opportunity there in Rael and Dean I see your hands are both still up but I'm not sure if you have a new mine is meant to be down sorry okay no problem okay does anybody have any uh thoughts on these criteria or just general thoughts about the recreation standard we didn't have a lot of specific issues on this so we're open to hearing pretty much anything any go ahead Fugi hi hi Chris um I just think uh personally I think Recreation opportunities may even be easier to deal with than the scenic but I just want to say I think this is a great place to bring the tourism industry in to play that sector is missing and this is a great place for they really know this very well so that's my input and and the hotel and um hotel motel um associations associations yeah they know the recreation stuff the best so thank thanks we're not buying any any more Ace thank you AR yeah um any other uh comments on Recreation just for the good discussion um if not um we have a few minutes left does anybody want to make any um well I guess we can discuss about we should discuss our next steps so um we've got through all the issues we've identified and um a few additional things have come up but it sounds like they are things that uh we need to do um some more research on an our side and we have some more resources um that we need to to look uh at um before we make our final recommendations but uh I think my proposal is still that we um do that work we update our issues document and then we circulate the draft proposed rules uh to the public for an initial review before we go back to the council with our final recommendations um I'll just ask if anybody has any uh issues or concerns with that approach um you know feel free to say so now or or send me a note but um I think at this point we are not planning on scheduling addition workshops I'm sorry can you repeat Chris what the you're you're going to come up with the Draft rules and then what was next um we'll come up with draft proposed rules and then we'll circulate those uh to the public to our rule making mailing list um and anybody that participated in the workshops before we go to the council with a final recommendation got it okay thank you sound good and then of course there'd be a formal public comment period based on whatever the council approves for um so it sounds like that's okay Jocelyn Chris just one question um what are you thinking of for for timing it sounds like you've gotten a lot of input from folks um that you're going to be processing and perhaps doing some additional outside research um do you have any sense of approximately when we might expect to see the updated analysis and um staff's recommendations um I don't have a firm date and I can we can try to kind of look and see where we're at um and get that out I I will be honest that I am not optimistic about getting a draft out before the new year but um probably that December January time frame would be what I would shoot what I I would be shooting for um but yeah don't um I guess don't take that as gospel because that that may change um thanks I can't say that we can we can um get together the meeting notes um from these workshops relatively quickly and probably publish a revised timeline at that time as well um and I would expect that to come out in the next um month at the latest fi I just want to clarify from this graphic you have here so and you're going you're going to send out the meeting information etc etc you're going to have your draft December January time frame you're saying then that that is going to the council and um we would we would send this first draft out to you all first and then um revise it based on feedback and then send that to the council okay and then when it goes to the council are you still prior to the next step of notice of proposed rulemaking so we're still when it goes to the council we would be asking them to uh make a decision based on uh the proposed the draft that we take them and and then then they would authorize the issuance of the notice of proposed will making and that was noral process okay thank you okay seeing no other hands and hearing no comments um thank you thank you everybody for the really great conversation today um I think we got a lot of valuable input and certainly a lot to think about um and uh we will definitely be thinking about all these issues carefully we may be reaching out um to some folks with some uh for some of the technical information that we talked about today as this process goes on but if anybody has any materials or advice uh that they'd like the council to consider um you can send it to fc. rulemaking energy. org.gov or my personal email is Christopher Park energy. org.gov um and I'm happy to discuss this stuff with you or um you know again anything that you send us we'll consider um otherwise we'll be planning on like I said publishing the audio from this Workshop getting our meeting notes together with a revised timeline together in the next month or so and then um probably be looking at proposed rules uh draft a draft proposed rules for public review and in early 2022 um with that thanks again for your time and um yeah much appreciate it thank you Chris thanks Chris thank you thanks Chris thank you thank you bye thank",

        "text": " I think the battery site uh itself which they're kind of on a combined site um and we did uh request that be included in a condition uh and I don't think that particular setback distance showed up in the the management plan so I think that would exceed um that defensible space would exceed these standards otherwise the standards are based kind of on the engineering details and the likelihood of um aring based on the voltage of the equipment and that's beyond my particular knowledge set um uh so otherwise these are the standards that would apply it's the international um Institute of electrical engineers uh standards the National Electric committee standards and the um which are I think also adopted by the National Fire Protection Association and then the National Electric reliability Corporation standards um a lot of acronyms a lot of acronyms and I uh yeah please please don't ask me to explain what's what's in that um right next slide um so to kind of go through the issues um uh we heard concerns about hazard from lightning and uh both I think the hazard from lightning striking turbines and the hazard of lightening starting a fire uh at the site and um that getting out of control and there extra equipment being out there um so it's not referenced in the Wildfire plan or the associated documentation um but in the project description portion of the rfa1 um the certificate holder did indicate that a lighting protection system would be incorporated into the turbine blades um that from what I understand provides a pathway uh for the current to go through the blades and down through the tower and be grounded um to reduce fire risk uh I think the certificate holder represents that that would eliminate fire risk from lightning and I think we all know that's not the case it reduces it or minimizes it but um there is still some risk there um the Wildfire mitigation plan does call for monitoring during Red Flight warnings and um based on some of the review of the data from the National Weather Service it is my understanding that red flag warnings can be issued in Morrow County in conditions where there might be a dry lightning event um that's means that there's a lightning storm combined with other high fire risk uh things so most of the provisions in the Wildfire mitigation plan are are related to whether or not construction work will occur um they do reference that there will be people monitoring the site um and monitoring fire weather and then during operations it would be monitoring by the scata system uh that's incorporated into the facility components um I yeah I I guess I will open the floor to you all to think whether uh you believe those adequately address these concerns or whether you think we should go more um I uh gr for the record this is Marcy gril I think what I would be curious to know obviously there's a distinct difference between construction and operation generally speaking when Farms don't have a whole lot of folks running around um during operation and so it might be something to identify during High periods um but the other part to council member im's point about coordination in general when I think about these Wildfire mitigation plans and I think about the ones that utilities have um that they have at least the IUS have to submit to the Pu um foration because if you know my experience right now is during um high-risk Seasons they are like nope you can't do anything shut it down and so are are they working together because in general when you think about the transmission lines you know they're they're doing their con anyway it's just I think that's something to to ask the developer about is are you coordinating with the um other facilities utilities and things around because that's where I think the risk may come and then Al timately do they have the same bandwidth to to stop work um if you know a local utility is saying you know we're at a Red Flag Warning we've got everybody out patrolling line because we're worried and you're just Trucking along that's not helping that Community that's my buyer this is a much simpler concept but if we can have the provision about the lightning protection syst systems reflected in the Wildfire mitigation plan because I wouldn't have thought to look at the projects specs I would like it there because that at least says yeah this is a thing and we're concerned about it in this context thank you thank you council member by I will just say my own research on this showed that if there are issues with the whing protection system that's when there can still be a fire risk so I think we would also recommend that inspections of those components be specified to thank um uh so the next big big topic area was that there was inadequate consideration of fire spread potential during high wind events uh and that the potential for impacts to residences agricultural buildings equipment cropland and cropland soils uh wasn't um adequately addressed in the wild fire mitigation plan um and so we we agree with those comments um we do think that the plan needs to be revised to address these issues um we would like guidance from the Council on uh to what extent you think those revisions need to go how specific uh is good enough to to really say this I mean in some ways I think um we would at a minimum like to see at least contact between the rural fire service providers and and an agreement that explains who will respond to a fire and where and that there's a protocol for uh the onsite managers to provide them with constrain Maps or or at least direct the fire suppression activities away from the sensitive resources in a more Ideal World we'd like to see maps and figures showing exactly how everything will go down but I know that's maybe not realistic so um as we're open to any Council suggestions on this issue councel gril I think I'm okay with putting a little burden on folks because of the impact for what we're talking about and I think if if we leave it too subjective then again our responsibilities is to the communities and that that they have they should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that there is a real plan not a make Bel my experience is in moments of Crisis people panic and we need to ensure that the certificate holder um and the developer are doing everything possible that it's documented people know what to do and there's no question and to council members I'm Point again talking about rural areas don't have a lot of resources to start so they may have to do something to support along the way to protect these areas so I'm saying the more the better this is Kent and I um is there a difference between construction activities in times of just operation after construction as far as these types of wildfire provision concerns uh is it there's a fire it doesn't matter whether it's just operation or whether they're under construction chair how I would say for response not as much um it is more of an issue I mean fire at the site is a fire at the site there is some issues that there's things on the landscape like once the battery system is there the fire resp responders need to know whether or not it's safe to fight fire around the battery system they need to know how to do that um things like that um so the prevention side of the planning I think does change quite dramatically but the fire response side of it is less dynamic between construction and operation okay yeah that too chair how um councelor IMS um I would I would um really like to see the certificate holder um and the applicant um the developer um engage with the local we've already talked about this with the local fire districts um which are not just Morrow County it's Umatilla County too um and that there there could be possibly some um on-site training for those First Responders and also um that they could assess the Ware mitigation plan and give timely response to that plan and any um that those be um you know that there they have the opportunity to respond to the plan um and any issues that they have with it and any you know potential issues that they might see um we've talked a little bit about capacity um and having you know that's just a our observation so I'm sure that they would have the same um and then also identifying um the structures you know that are most vulnerable in the area um that would probably be an important part of assessing um the you know the Wildfire mitigation plan and and having a plan in place to address um how they're going to you know rise to that conflict so um those are just two little things that I can think of and I'm not even a fire expert right so um I just think about my own home and where I live you know that um those are things that I would think about as a homeowner in an area where you're surrounded by Dryland wheat and towers and lightning and all these different factors that uh are real so U the big thing for me is really the coordination with the fire districts that that be addressed and that that be done um in a timely manner um I don't know if anything in your recommendation talks about preconstruction having things done before um or not but I think that's a relevant discussion for the council to consider if anybody else has any thoughts on that and I would sorry this is council member Grail and I would also suggest with that training and coordination don't forget the local utilities because there is a big difference between going to a wind farm than handling your normal facilities and often times people think oh well you're you're linan you can fig well hold on because I don't do this every day so they need to be part of the mix too and and they are electrical qualifi and they would be a great resource they do have you know tools and they are are considered first respond responder so I would encourage them to be part of the the mix I've watched um anyway I just from experience I would say don't forget to acknowledge that those are resources available okay I just thought of something else too that I wrote in my notes um and that is just out of curiosity if the um County Emergency manager has been brought into the loop on this this kind of stuff if they are even on other projects in Oregon but um I think that's a good resource to um have part of the discussion is the emergency manager for the county both counties you council members um chair how if I may I just wanted to add and to point out as um we continue forward with this project but um so there is an existing condition that Council previously imposed in the original site certificate it's called gen pso3 it was before the Wild",

        "text": " what we purchased from say from PGE is around does that so if you were to factor in the code generation facility at will a lake does that number even go up higher than but because that's I'm assuming we're not purchasing that electricity I'm not sure how that factors okay because that's electricity we're generating right so this would be electricity that we are purchasing right kg so um in terms of total usage that would be an interesting thing to look at so because that's a huge amount that's powering out basically that whole facility right right Michael yeah I do um so Wendy thank you this is Mike Slater I'm a salon planning commissioner um I'm very interested to just pick up on counselor Stapleton on how we expand um the footprint of renewable energy in Salem and storage facilities and particularly interested from a resiliency standpoint as well have you worked with a city that has developed like their own energy plan um like a renewable energy plan or resiliency plan like a city-wide to get it what cancer Stapleton was talking about like a a long-term City strategic well there's there's a few there's a few cities that have a climate action plans um and I think um each of them has a slightly different Focus there's certainly about uh reducing the greenhouse gas emissions um and some of them have components of um but but again this is uh probably Multnomah County in city of Portland um may have uh components of that Milwaukee is also has a clean uh a climate action plan as well but uh part I think if I uh and Heather certainly can correct me but apart I think of the City of Salem was a resiliency component um and the micro get is an example of that you know again that was the first one that we're doing that that is all connected to to certainly and includes battery storage and the Public Works um and community members so that's kind of the first of a kind and and that really is towards resiliency because in the event that that facility would continue to operate and but we were happy to look at more ways to build on that in Salem uh that that if that is of Interest with with all of you as leaders so you don't have you aren't aware of a city that has a like a master plan or a comprehensive plan related to energy production distribution storage you know we have a transportation master plan we have a comprehensive master plan a Parks master plan I'm just wondering if other people have an energy master plan no no we don't we don't no in fact again I'm just I'm just gonna compliment you because City of Salem has generally been at the Forefront uh before you had the climate action plan you did have um you guys can correct me City staff can correct me but you had an energy plan in terms of uh Energy Efficiency and conservation and some targets around that uh before I can say this because I I'm gonna age myself I've been here a little a while and I can say that it was it was ahead of many other communities when you first introduced even an energy I think that was from 2010 I'm not mistaken uh Energy Efficiency block conservation block grant program we had a community energy plan that was developed back then um can I lean into this just a little um Chris I'd love to hear your thoughts but I would love to see this this idea of a comprehensive plan on how do we get to this place where everybody has that micro what is it called grid thank you and and renewable energy is across the city and and for those purposes both but twofold being resilient and also addressing our our um energy needs in a renewable way I would love to see something like that become part of of our of our plan moving it's intriguing I don't know enough about it yet to have an opinion either way but um I I'm interested in the idea I think that you know if we're ever going to move things significantly you have to have you have to have a plan that get takes us over the Long Haul and not just you know you know really these small and criminal things so I would like to know more about that I don't know are you aware of one somewhere no and those are kind of okay and so this idea of us kind of leading the way I really like that idea too right I mean part of it is frustrating because you think like I don't know how you all feel but I'm always like I'm pushing right and I want to do more and I'm constantly thinking that other people are ahead but then when you learn that we are ahead it's twofold you're very proud of the work we're doing but you're also frustrated that not more work is being done right no one knows and nobody yeah everyone thinks Portland's in the league but I would love to keep it so I do have one more question if I could yes um I just can I just share with counselor Stapleton is I think one of the pieces that um will further uh refine in terms of a program is I did mention the community supported Renewables tariff and we the kind of we call it the muni tariff and both Heather and Ryan have been involved in providing feedback and learning more and that is where the entire Community it's a program that potentially the entire Community would be getting their energy from a renewable source uh again because of the IRP and cep and and rfps that's three acronyms in a row I apologize because we recently filed our integrated resource plan and clean energy plan and that outlines our RFP for 2023 we are uh pausing that develop the plan simply so that um we we don't want to develop it out of alignment with with all the with the short-term action plans and we'll have a better sense next year but um that is one that is that is where potentially where where you're you're one of I can say a handful of cities that have provided feedback into the development of that tariff and that are waiting um to kind of further develop it and understand how that program would work um say to Salem Portland um Milwaukee um I believe Beaverton those are all some of the cities that you're all looking for potentially that kind of community-wide program for uh getting your and getting energy from a divorce sources but more to come on that and again we have engaged certainly Heather on this front and any continued conversations they they participated in workshops and we've had meetings with with our staff on that with with your with your team there thank you Wendy yeah yeah so one last question I have is so what resources does PGE have if Salem is interested in expanding its renewable energy infrastructure that's a great question um and right now I think the microgrid one is we're really interested in that partly because you know how do we expand exactly getting to council president stapleton's how do we expand on that program and do it in a kind of cost-effective way that that um that incorporates business and and residents and so those are things that we'll be looking at those are the kinds of conversations that we love to have to talk about areas that might make sense for potential opportunities um and I think particularly on the distributive uh generation side um we would love to have conversations about the city potentially investing in in that program again that is where uh basically you have a large battery for backup systems for example a police station although we don't serve them an Alleyway kept us from serving them Salem electric serves them we love Salem electric so but you have a large scale battery that's a Backup backup to your generation in case anything ever happens well most of the time those batteries are there again only in emergency situations so they're sitting there um we have a program that we would love to talk with City Salem is if you incorporate some more of these batteries they're basically little many um generating plants because on the hottest days of the year and the coldest days of the year we would tap into that energy if you're not using it of course we would tap into that energy and it would help us with our load so those are the kind of conversations we'd love to have with you about how do we how do we have City of Salem kind of engage in those kinds of programs and there are resources available for us to do that is that what I understand yes and we all you know there there's um there is resources available um and there uh there's resources available and we have you know we can certainly talk about that thank you any other questions for Wendy I'm I'm not following the muni tariff and what what's what is that uh that is um in essence it's a community-wide community-wide renewable program so every every resident and business would be opted into the community-wide program so everyone would be getting their energy from a renewable source so I as I understand it please correct me if I'm wrong Wendy basically Council would set a policy that we are a community tariff community and so you're instead of opting in members would have to opt out so it basically just reverses it from an OP an OP into an opt-out so by default your renewable energy as opposed to by default you're the general Max is that accurate Wendy yes yes great yes PG provided a very uh brief overview on the Tariff program I think it was September of last year is right about the time you were getting here now you were not the meeting I don't think does it provide some revenue for there you go I'm in yes that is part of it and the city again uh mayor horie is correct the city would set up the policy and and how it um identify the projects that it wanted to invest in and I think it kind of gets worse yeah and then we would we would be able to identify you know otherwise it's it's just all very nice things to say um when's the timeline for that next year um again we're we're putting up we were in development but because of the IRP and and um we have our short-term action plans we're putting out an RFP in 2023 and those um projects aren't a debt of potential projects unidentified until the spring of 2024 we anticipate that in 2024 we'll move forward on working understanding what um the short term what those projects are we'll look at the summer of 2024 for that program perfect thank you thank you any other questions well thank you very much Wendy we really appreciate it thank you and just so you know you guys are doing awesome we love Salem you're awesome to work with and you're an awesome",

meeting tonight we'll be providing information about the proposed facility and the eny facility side and Council review process we will also be providing an opportunity for public questions and comments after the presentation my name is Chase MCB Walker I'm a senior sighting Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy in the sting division it's our responsibility to process and review the application for this facility once we receive it and to ultimately provide recommendations to the energy facility sting Council the energy facility sting Council jurisdiction over this proposed transmission line and they will ultimately make the decision on whether or not to approve or deny the application I'm joined here tonight my Sarah esperson senior policy advisor of the sighting division Kathleen Sloan senior sighting analyst in the sting Division and Nancy hatch our division Administrative Assistant do we have any council members on line don't know ored I think we were expecting one thank you awesome um we also have the applicant newella Electric Cooperative um in the room as well and following my portion of the presentation electric will be providing a follow my presentation on the presentations this meeting will be recorded is recorded and will be posted to the project web page for this facility along with a copy of the presentation slides tonight presentation slides in fact are already on the project website and I will be uh providing the link to the project web page later in my presentation should anyone like to write after I provide an overview of that facility signing Council process an apping team will describe their proposed facility we then will open up the meeting to questions and comments from the public but please hold questions and next slide please this is just a overview agenda of what I just said um and let's see I think next slide please getting getting into it on September 22nd 2023 Oregon Department of energy or oo received the notice intent to file an application for a site certificate for Umatilla which is 230 kolt transmission line with four proposed route Alternatives traversing both Morrow County counties the length of the proposed transmission line ranges from approximately 13 to 15 miles depending on the selected route alternative um and the sub mission of the notice of intent is the very first step in the FC review process of obtaining a site certificate in the noi was submitted by lumella Electric Cooperative their applicant this informational meing is intended to give members of the public an opportunity to learn about the proposal and provide comments on the N no it is not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting is not required to preserve issues or standing for the contested case as I mentioned the Forefront of the presentation please hold your comments questions until the uh comment Peri at the end of the presentation and please be uh respectful we have a lot of material that we want to get through make sure we want to make sure we have time for everyone's comments at the end of the meeting next please the sighting division at the Oregon Department of energy serve as technical staff support of the energy facilties s Council which all referred to as or Council from here and the energy facility Center F FC reviews applications and amendments for site certificates that fall under jurisdiction the council consists of up to seven members serving in a volunteer capacity council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate Additionally the council represents diverse professional backgrounds from across the state and while oo staff makes recommendations to FC it is FC that's the final decision making Authority for energy facilities under jurisdiction including this proposed transmission line in addition to reviewing projects seeking a permit known as a site certificate the sighting division does have a compliance program that oversees compliance with each uh approved facility each each site including during the preconstruction construction operations and phases we conduct site visits at least annually and more frequently when the facility is under construction the fet process as a whole is a Consolidated review process between state and local governments in the set forth in Oregon administrative rules and Oregon revised statutes with the set of 16 General standards for review what this means is a developer can obtain most of the major State approvals in the local landuse approval through the F process if the council issues an approval or a s certificate for the facility the intent is to eliminate the duplication and sometimes conflict between different permitting timelines decisions and appeal paths while this provides more certainty for a developer in the sense that the major permits will either all be approved or all be Deni this also provides the public one regulatory process to track because this is a Consolidated review process public participation as well as participation from State engine local governments and tribal governments is even more important in a few minutes I'll discuss as a whole further and how and when you can get involved you may have heard me use the word sighting several times now sighting refers to a viewing of a proposed energy facility against the number against the number of of predetermined requirements known as standards based on site specific locational issues that may be affected by facility on the next slide I will be discussing sex standards please note that land Acquisitions land leases uh in easements are all outside of the F before a jurisdictional facilties is for the developer must apply for a site certificate from the energy facility sighting Council the types of facilities subject to council jurisdiction are defined in Morgan Revis statute 46930 we also listed on this screen the definition of energy facility is also located within that Century reference and I just wanted to point out that high voltage transmission lines uh are are included in that definition next slide or high voltage elect electrical transmission lines a project in order to be state jurisdictional has to be greater than 10 miles in length uh equal or greater to 230 kts and must cross more than one jurisdiction this proposed project fits three and that is why it is stay jurisdictional going through the FC process next slide please in order to issue a site certificate the energy facility signing Council must determine that the facility complies with all applicable Council standards or the overall public benefits uh of the overall public benefits of the facility outweigh any adverse effects on a resource or interest protected by the standards the facility does not need the facility must also determine that the facility complies with all other organ laws rules identified in the project order um or as amended and as applicable to the issuance of a site certificate for the facility and lastly must determine that the facility complies with the Statewide land use planings the fet process is a standard based process it's the applicants burden of proof to demonstrate compliance with all applicable standards and rules every project has to meet the same 16 General standards as well as some additional standards that apply to specific facility types for this particular facility uh the citing standard for transmission lines would appli and requires that applicant design construct and operate the facility to comply with specific requirements relating to alternating current electric fields and currents these standards incorporate local government and S agency requirements include protections for fish wild like habitat Public Services land use structural safety cultural resources among other fsec cannot change the standards without undergoing rule making uh so for example there there isn't an air quality standard and there wouldn't be unless there was a r making effort made the magnitude of what an applicant has to provide to document that they have me burden proof for each standard varies based on type of facility and the location of the facility propos facility for example if a project is proposed in an industrial zone property in an urban environment ficient Wildlife standard uh will likely be very easy to meet whereas a project proposed in an undisturbed Natural Area would likely require a substantial amount of uh on the ground survey work and mitigation requirements it's the Department's role to evaluate all in addition to any comments received from the public trial governments state agencies and local governments to determine whether or not the applicant has met the burden of proof for each standard we then the department make our recommendation to fsac who evaluates all of this information in the record and comes to a decision if Council decides that all of the applicable standards Council must issue a um just as County uh must issue a Perman Lo requirements neither the council nor staff can propose to put the facility in a different location we must instead evaluate what is proposed by the appli because we are at the notice of notice of intent stage we seek any type of comment anyone wants to provide however when we get to the next stage in the process focusing comments on the standards more important since fex Authority is limited to those standards and uh they are all that can be evaluated to to approve or deny the okay here's a a flowchart of the major steps in the FC review process there's seven major steps in this FC review process I'd like to emphasize that we are at the very beginning of the FC itself for those on the webinar and in the room uh the first stage of this process is the notice an intense stage and there's a red box around this first step to indicate where we are um also on this chart you can see great which uh indicate opportunities for public participation in the FC process we do have um additional information a public guide available on our web page page our website for those like to get into more detail on uh steps so because we're at the first step the applicant submitted the noi they submitted it on September 22nd 2023 the noi provides basic information about the also include or indicates the permits that the facility may require and potential impacts to various resources and listing map of properties that would be crossed by the facilities the noi is valid for two years that means the applicant has until September 22nd 2025 to submit their application once the department has issued a project order however in the case of this particular project the applicant is indicated they will submit their application by or in July next year 2024 at this time at the end of this presentation uh we'll be soliciting comments from the public and state agencies local governments and tribal governments and the uh the public comment period for comments on the noi closes December 1st for this year in 2023 after we've received all comments the department will release a project order which will list the application submitt requirements in applicable statutes schools and standard the Second Step based on the application the will once the project order is is issued the applicant will submit an application",

about site certificate conditions I've never challenged that there is a legitimate site certificate and amended site certificate so so you know broadening the response for to the mment request denying it is not appropriate it was only there is a legitimate site certificate okay does that make sense thank you any questions okay thank you Miss Gilbert Nancy anybody on web back uh at this point I do not oh hold on we have Mr Troy Jones with his hand raised hold on a moment and I will unmute your Mr Jones you your mic is open you're ready to comment thank you Mr Jones could you state your name and spell it for us yes good morning my name's Troy Jones t r o y j o n s thank you I live I live at 22335 Gap Road Harrisburg Oregon the reason I'm here today uh Madame Vice chair is and fellow council members is because uh uh I live near a location where there was a notice of intent issued for a muddy creek energy Park which is A600 acre uh solar uh facility uh that they want to put on uh exclusive Farm use properties uh I attended last month's uh February meeting and I wanted to follow up again this month and I may sound like I'm repeating myself but in essence I do have an ask at the end so if you would be patient with me in a time uh when equality is so important to all of us in all types of different life aspects yeah I still find it difficult to understand how or why the energy facility C fac facility sighting Council has been provided the ability to site industrial solar facilities on zoned areas not suitable for the proposed Project without being required to determine if there are other areas perhaps more suitable that would not require a land use exception and can accommodate the proposed land use the inequality is the fact that the land conservation development commission does have such a requirement and to be more specific last time I didn't last month didn't go into the details but currently OS 46954 section 2 does not require the energy facility sighting Council to determine if alternative sighting locations exist which would not require a land use exception this law actually supersedes ORS 197.4 32 which does require this consideration it's my position that or 469 504 subsection 2 does need to be changed to contain the same considerations as the that that the land uh conservation development commission must must follow so my ask here is and and is I'm just curious if this is something that the energy facility sighting Council can consider having a rules advisory committee review or if this is something that I need to pursue from a legislative perspective thank you I think Mr secretary for the record Todd cornette um I think you know whether or not a rule could be added in the energy facility sighting council's rules um we would have to evaluate certainly the more clear way of doing it would be a statutory change going through the legislature um that would be you know a the the more clear Avenue uh in regards to whether we can do it through rul making that I'm not sure that would have to be evaluated so so just just uh what I heard you say is is it would be easier to go through the legislative function I'm not sure it would be easier but I would say that's a maybe the clear path okay clear path okay got it well thank you thank you uh Mr cornet I appreciate that that sure thank you Mr Jones is that is that all or do you want to go on no for today I think that's adequate okay thank you thank you for your time thank you thank you I do not see any other hands raised at this time but I will go ahead and just remind people again how to participate if they wanted to make a comment so if you are on the excuse me if you're on the webinar um you're going to hover your hand over the participant list and you can click your raise your hand icon and that will raise your hand to make a comment if you are on the phone you're going to press star three to raise your hand to make a comment and then you can go ahead and press star three to lower your hand after you've finished I do not see any other hands raised at this time okay I think we'll move on our next item on the agenda is the Boardman solar energy project termination of site certificate and secretary cornette assistant director of sighting of sighting and the Council secretary will proceed thank you madam Vice chair uh for the record Todd Cornett assistant director for sighting at the Oregon Department energy and uh secretary to the energy facility sighting Council so as indic ated this is the uh request by the department to terminate the bardman solar energy project site certificate next slide please Nancy um so you can see on the screen there's more details in the staff report so I'm not going to go through all the details about the project but briefly um it's a 75 megawatt solar PV project on 798 Acres um it includes uh related and supporting facilities the main components of the project uh were approved in North Morrow County just south of id4 um and then there was also related and supporting 115 KV transmission line um I think that was largely in north or prop excuse me approved in North Gillum County the certificate holder is bardman solar energy LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of invenergy Solar Development LLC which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of inventor gllc next slide please um same this is not all the details associated with the timeline of the project but it's kind of a summary um so you can see the project was originally approved by Council in 2018 at that point they had a beginning construction deadline of February 23rd 2021 prior to that deadline they submitted request for Amendment one to extend the beginning construction deadline cited that they did not have a power purchase agreement at the time uh Council approved that in September 2021 giving an extension to February 23rd 2024 uh late last year Sarah esterson senior policy adviser with the Oregon Department of energy sent the certificate holder a reminder email that their certificate was going to expire unless they submitted another request for a Time extension um they responded uh about 2 month months later indicating that they did not intend to uh pursue a Time extension rather they intended to let the site certificate expire and then propose the project uh at the county level uh based upon changes at the legislature giving the um counties larger amounts of acreage um in terms of what their jurisdictional thresholds or their jurisdictional abilities were in terms of solar projects uh the one thing that's in the staff report that's not on the slide is that in their original application the entire project was was um in the record they had indicated that entire project location was high value Farmland um by definition the project is located within the Columbia Valley AVA and then based upon certain slope and aspect ratios within that area properties are high value farmland so they indicated in their application materials the entire project was high value Farmland um now they've indicated well they've done more evaluation more research um and it is not um and so the current threshold for FC jurisdiction on high value Farmland is 240 acres so if they want to proceed with the project at the county level they have to justify that it is 240 acres or less of high value Farmland they have submitted a jurisdictional deter mination with more details about the slope and aspect um we have not conducted that evaluation yet regardless so that's more just more information for you to be aware of but has it's not gerine to your evaluation today um that's just if they want to move forward with this project who would have jurisdiction so and then the last thing on sorry can you go back once so again going back to the deadline they did not begin construction um as that's defined um in statute by February 23rd 2024 therefore the site certificate has expired next slide please so the applicable rules related to this are on the screen U as you can see based on rule 0313 um as well as the condition in the site certificate n gs01 so General condition um and that's of the first amended site certificate because the certificate holder did not begin construction by the established state as I just indicated the site certificate has expired now based upon the other rule uh 0110 when a site certificate has expired the council shall issue an order terminating the site certificate so that's effectively where we're at today so they have lost their ability um it's expired ired so they cannot begin construction they cannot move forward with this project um really what remains is the council's termination terminating the site certificate um and you can see the options that are on here so the first is to approve termination of the site certificate um attached to the staff report is a draft order which does that um and so if you approve um through a vote today of that site certificate either the chair or the vice chair would sign that um draft order we would make it a take the draft off it and that would be a final order uh you would sign this the termination order and that would conclude it um option two would be to vote to terminate the site certificate but if there are additional changes in that draft order that you feel are appropriate to make you could do that as well and then thirdly if there is more information that you need you can defer um termination uh voting on the termination today again that doesn't change the fact that the site certificate has expired they cannot move forward so at some point even if you would like to defer it that you will need to terminate the site certificate and last slide is your deliberation or certainly if you have any questions of me members of the council any questions comments before a motion um I just want to clarify something um with respect to your comment about the review that will be um if that review comes up with the different you say no no this is high value uh then is there anything um does does",

        "text": " Lut to talk about the people that have been invited to sit on this ugr report and where where we may want to make additional recommendations uh along with commissioner Frye I thought that the Roundtable last week was very good and I I appreciated everybody's engagement I think it was hard on all of us to put our devices away and really really be engaged but it was great to see that we all could do that so um thank you for that and it was I think that the facilitator was really good and she worked worked us through the process and kept us on point so thank you for providing that for us I had the wingspan business operations overview along with commissioner Willie and it was interesting there's a lot of questions still that you need to be asking but Rachel did a great job along with Matt in presenting information to us uh I met with Eric Cole yesterday Eric is the executive director of revitalized Portland Commission who works with he works for Schnitzer and they're involved in the Bybee Lakes piece and that type of thing but anyway I talked to him about possibly becoming a member of west side economic Alliance and I'm going to be introducing Elizabeth masara Myers and Eric together to to think about what that what that might look like today I have a jail update from the sheriff I have a meeting with Dave Nielsen from HBA and I had the Chief Human Resources officer interviews this week and then in mpac coordinating meeting this week so that is it we're out of time yeah thanks uh Pam for that to reminding me of the um the wingspan overview um that was a good presentation paper we look forward to the complete report may I interrupt with a compliment you did a great job of providing information to me and providing kind of a background of the TLT so thank you yeah I've been around working with that TLT and the wingspan a few other things for a while so it's um complex so let's see I also got the jail update yesterday uh from the sheriff that was a good conversation met with Multnomah County chair Vega Peterson uh yesterday on Bobby lakes and um just asking what what their position was and trying to get a little background on it because up to this point in time the relationship hasn't been very good so I'm seeing what we can do to work with them as well I was more on the ivy lake side of things but also saying that we here in Washington County are trying to find a place for a similar facility and bring something like that to the county as well so working with those folks on that uh Courtney Tom Courtney made a presentation similar to I don't know if his similar to years last night but it was on public meeting laws with the rural roads folks and it's always interesting you know there's only about it was only about six or eight of them but all of them were um amazingly uninformed on the public median laws and what they couldn't could not do and so this is a good process I think we need to continue that I certainly support that much of my presentation was stolen Courtney well that's a good basis yes I always give credit where credit's due the round table yes I agree is an interesting conversation I am not a big fan of uh trying to find the right words to put in a strategic plan but I did enjoy the afternoon when we talked about priorities from the commission and what's coming down the pike so I thought that was a good session met with um executive director Monique Morin with GPI and got an update on a couple of their applications they made uh the state for some money they did not get request but they're still working on a variety of other Consulting trying to improve the image of of the city of Portland and you know Wall Street Journal came out a couple weeks ago and it was certainly not positive in any form or fashion so I got a lot of work to do there and she realizes that we had the picnic summer social last week and that was uh that was fun to get everybody together because we don't see the whole gang on a regular basis so it's good to get them together and have that have opportunity to talk it so it's good picnic so thanks for doing that and just a point of clarification this is the County Administration office Department not a county picnic yeah that's right yeah sorry I said that and then yeah I think uh I think I'm going to um try and keep up with commissioner Teresa's vacation days so I'm going to take a while this there's no comparison that's all I got thank you I know you have another item well I just wanted to uh mention one thing about acre that wasn't mentioned and that is that we've had we will be getting two additional members of acre uh we've got to have two people that are leaving because of personal issues one moving out of the area and so I think that uh we we will be reviewing the recommendations here and I just want to let you know that part name of the I remembered it Jeff Baker I made a mistake in front of everybody calling Jeff Barker because we had a barker out here forever and he explained to him why and he said very gracious guy so no problem great legislator and a great police former policeman policeman Jeff Parker yep all right the next item on our agenda is that we have a letter I think this is the Met Perry letter that came to his last minute it doesn't seem pretty I'm not pretty good I don't yeah anybody have a problem all right we'll sign thank you that sounds easy now Community Corrections a biennium plan review here's me Aaron's make it to go solo yeah how do I get it there we go look at that he's sitting in the eating chicken what are you doing up there I haven't uh had the opportunity to go through this little clicker yet um thank you for the opportunity to present before you today uh acting chair Rogers and the rest of the board I'm Nate galleran I'm the director of Community Corrections here in Washington County so um and I get the slide deck we don't have it apparently is that right Kevin I did not slide deck wasn't in the it was a 74 page document in there but there was no since this is your first presentation we asked that you sing and dance your presentation okay no that could that could happen maybe maybe just send it to Kevin quickly okay Tim so you're not into this yeah just don't send it to Kevin Barton but yeah so Kevin it's in PDF we can load it and then yeah reminds me of the meeting last night we were in and we were in a hotel because internet wasn't working we had people from all over and uh it was it was not hybrid meetings are not particular oh good unless you're really set up for them yeah yeah I understand um while I'm here I'll just explain a little bit to you all that don't know and and the rest of the public the reason why we present this we call it a CCA planner Community Corrections allotment plan it's to inform the public on where those funding dollars are going and um we had to get it ratified before the public safety coordinating Council and that recommendation came with a unanimous vote to you all to push this thing forward to get it ratified with the Department of Corrections as a contract between Doc and Washington County so that's the reason why we're here uh to get this thing pushed through so we've already started our biennium has started uh July 1st uh 2023 and it'll go through the end of June 2025 and we have we have a slide that now will I still have control uh okay now I'll have you have control okay so good very good um so that's the uh the first part of it you can see the ORS that uh that outlines those expectations for us to go through this particular process and um next slide Kevin I wanted to talk a little bit about our mission and our core values and that we uh hold true to equity diversity and inclusion we adapt we're constantly changing obviously within our industry we have a very good leadership team here very good practitioners that work within uh Community Corrections and and uh committed to the work uh part of the core values are accountability collaboration respect and heart and I think heart is the intangible that um I don't think gets shared enough and we have really difficult work but we have a lot of people that are dedicated to it and get through to promote Public Safety next slide please so I wanted to provide some director notes here um obviously I'm I'm new to this County I'm not new to the industry I've been in the industry for about 23 years but only three months uh here in Washington County we have uh some challenges with recruitment as well as retention of practitioners and it's not just within Community Corrections I think you're seeing that across the industry in public safety we also have budget cuts so I'm going to talk a little bit about the budget cuts in that 10 percent or little over 10 percent uh came from the obviously locally we have approximately a four percent budget cut in Washington and then we also have some ballot measure 110 impacts our industry was built around dealing with drugs and addiction and uh and some of the Fallout there will ballot measure 110 totally changed the landscape of of our industry so we have some philosophical shifts that we're making and that's a challenge we also have some pandemic influence coming out of the pandemic we we've had a number of different hires that that came through during that particular phase in our in our our world and it's going to take a little bit of pivoting to to move forward because we're in the people business and we've got to show up to work so um that's going to be a heavier heavier lift I think for us um people-centered assessments this is a this is part of our um case plan strategy that we have for each one of the uh folks that are on supervision and another challenge for us it gets better there's a lot of challenges but it gets better I'll provide some solutions here uh Senate Bill 1510 had some impacts for um kind of unfunded mandates as it relates to contact standards and I'll just kind of set the table here the state provided what they see as a forecast of what we have to hit for contact standards and quite honestly we haven't been hitting that number and it's a tune of about half of the contacts that we've been making which means um there's",

        "text": " larger in front of the meter projects like purple qualifying facilities for example so as we progress through the study uh we'll be looking at the different topics uh with uh sort of sort of stratifying or with the perspective uh from these uh different types of projects that could fit in this um in addition to the overall objective of uh examining opportunities to encourage development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy at the hb 2021 also established a set a specific set of subtopics uh for the work group to examine um and those uh are so they include potential barriers and opportunities to project development in both investor owned and utility service territory um those that things like land use local and state utility regulations transmission capacity contracts or obligations under the public utility regulatory policies act and uh and project implementation or project costs and financing and the the bill also directs the work group to potential economic benefits of small-scale renewable energy projects as well as potential contributions of projects to uh to local energy resiliency they'll also directly work to study potential access and ownership opportunities for low-income communities or black indigenous people of color likened in life indigenous and people color tribal communities rural and coastal and other communities with limited as well as opportunities for diverse models of ownership by local governments non-profit organizations or co-operatives of community members the developer also directs the group to study potential rate impacts of projects and then uh potentially develop uh legislative recommendations that that could encourage development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects in oregon john we got a question in the chat that i think was related to the last slide there was curiosity about the basis for the rps qualification requirement why why the decision was made or the direction was given to stick with that definition i i guess um so again that um it goes back to the uh the definition uh it is in a statute for the small scale and community-based renewable energy targets projects as by size and then by a resource type and the resources are resources that uh qualify for the rps so we're really drawing on the definitions in statute to help what a as a small-scale community-based renewable energy project is i imagine so we did get a question and follow up that store whether or not storage would be included so um uh yes so so uh we uh will certainly i think stories will would certainly be included um uh you know it's a that's a i think a fundamental uh component that's that's emerging for uh many of these projects to have to to to um to accrue some of these resilience benefits is uh is when when projects these renewable projects are coupled with storage so we'll certainly be looking at um projects that both have renewable resources and storage capability all right thank you so much and thanks mark jessica for the questions all right um so lastly um the uh the small-scale renewable energy pro uh project statute defines the studies work group members um we've gone through our introductions already um so i won't delay this slide too much or go through the list but you know the purpose and intent here is to really ensure that the study uh brings together and represents perspectives from a broad range of energy stakeholders and uh but uh but now i i'll just take a pause here to see if there are any questions any additional questions or comments about the study objectives understanding that uh over the next few slides um i'm going to go more in depth about how we aim to operationalize the study or go into the logistics of how that how how the study will work but if there are any questions about sort of um statutory objectives okay i don't see any hands up or anybody coming off of you i actually have a question um hi um would there be any consideration i don't know if this is just going to be uh further in the study but consideration to renewables in regards to like carbon free generation versus maybe carbon emitting renewables such as biomass biogas etc um so so i think the the definition that we're working with would include uh projects uh drawing on biomass or biogas and uh for us to consider in the study as we as we're looking at the um sort of these are opportunities to encourage development of projects that can have economic and resilience benefits so so and that would be that those uh those projects would be uh within our you know with under our umbrella of projects that we could we could we will study and uh you depending on um so the the desire of the work group um we could certainly um see discussion around the um uh the definitions of claim and uh energy etc thank you guys answer your question yes thank you great and then uh counselor effelman has his hand up yeah my question and and in regard to the question it was just asked by many of the projects that we're looking at or some of the projects we're looking at have multiple side benefits such as removal of juniper which would enhance the availability of of ground and surface water as well as biomass reduction in the in the forest for forest healthy forest initiatives uh there are there are so many side benefits to some of the projects that we've been looking how can that be incorporated into the project or into the consideration of a or the the benefit in addition to the electricity generation i i sorry a comment or a question that you're asking if that if that's something that we would we would consider in this study i would i would press that as a as a question of will we consider that in the study yes so so the the um the work group will be looking at um opportunities opportunities and and uh some non-energy benefits of uh of small scale and community-based renewable energy projects which certainly can include environmental benefits or or other community benefits thank you thank you all right anything else before we move on to sort of the nuts and bolts of the how it'll actually work in other words what you all get to do for the next eight nine months or so all right i don't see anybody else coming off for any hands up right um so uh now i'll spend the next few slides as i said going over the study plan um make the point that in addition to the uh legislative objectives uh odo also has some objectives for the execution or operationalization of the study um and uh one of our goals is to really respect the legislative intent that the work groups study and examine the small scale renewable energy project um we want to ensure that the study is really a collaborative effort between odo staff and the work group and that the work group has a key role in determining and driving um the the research and investigations of this and we also recognize that uh work group members come to this study differing perspectives and and backgrounds um and that individuals in the work group have different learning styles and different uh preferred methods of con contributing to contributing to this effort um and so uh again we're really aiming to ensure that this study is a collaborative effort it's conducted transparently is accessible to to to all uh work group members um and that the study ultimately the products fairly reflect the perspective of all participants and so to that end we've planned the study in a way doing to try and encourage collaboration and offer multiple avenues for engagement and and participation of members um so the core activities of the um of the work group will be a set of topic area workshops uh the workshops uh are reflective of the uh the topics that are discussed in the previous set of slides uh the the specific topic areas that that hb 2021 outlined for us to uh to um and so those will take place in through june of 2022 there are a couple of reasons why we're starting in march one is uh a number of people many people in the work group will be involved in the legislative session so we want to wait until after the legislative session before we start taking your time um and then uh second um it gives uh staff and the work group time to preliminary research and analysis to help answer answer some of the questions posed by the study uh and uh and develop materials for the at the moment we you know hasn't uh started we haven't set what the format of these workshops will be we want that to be an effort between staff and and and work group you know some examples what that might entail will be would be on different topics uh to uh to conduct a a panel um review of odo research and analysis and then break out some discussion among uh workgroup members and other activities um each of these workshops will ultimately result in a topic area that will odo's final legislative report and then you're at this stage we're anticipating that these will be virtual meetings um throughout the the study but um we can revisit that as a group if we want uh in the future if if there's a desire to to um have one or more meetings in um so again establishing a timeline here uh that those workshops will occur in march april may and june of next year um to so so so the the work that the work people do in those workshops uh will be uh informed by initially by a questionnaire that odo will send to members of the work in the coming weeks that questionnaire will be aimed at key research topics of interest key research questions and input on research methods to answer questions from from work group members we will take the results of that questionnaire um and and and use those to help uh so um uh clarify and define the uh the research areas of interest for each of the workshops those workshops then planned by odo staff and uh some work uh workshop planning committees which will be made up of sub comm a subgroup of uh the full work group um so questionnaire will uh again will be uh we'll be sending that out to work group members uh in the week of the 13th of december and hope to have the responses back by the end of the year now as i mentioned uh with regards to workshop planning we want to ensure that the uh that the work the work group has input into the planning of research and analysis and uh to support the uh so we'll be forming uh workshop planning committees made up of a subset of members from the work group along with the questionnaire we'll send a survey to workgroup members asking for your preferences of which workshops you would like to be involved with we will ask uh members to contribute to uh to to one uh workshop planning group um but those uh uh planning committee meetings uh or activities will be open to all work group members and any materials that are developed by the",

sort of thing so we've included that here specifically for TCH category for the human cause threats so our rhythm is going to be that I'll te up some a c a grouping of mitigation measures and then I'm at you guys will go into slido and what I'm asking you to do is rank these so here we're looking at question number 15 and what you're going to do is simply drag the mitigation measures putting the most important one first and then putting them in order there within slid you do have to rank every single one of the mitigation measures to to complete that question so please put them all in order question 16 here is giving you an opportunity to include a measure That You Don't See on the list and you feel like should be there so please do add any in that you feel are missing have one question okay um on the drones I know port has some legal restrictions on their usage does this affect the utilities in other places are there any legal restrictions across the state for using drones for inspections yeah I don't know the policies region by region but I have been hearing I am aware that it varies across the state do yall have specific insight into not the answer to that question that's interesting yeah I will say that concern has been brought up at on a consistent basis around restrictions and what's allowed and what's not allowed both within or in and outside the SE feels like those ideas a policy change that would lead to a physical inspection change that maybe first there has to be a change of law to allow Dr to be used that area and there is a difference between commercial use and recreational use too so it could be that there's a commercial license available instead of just a person fly critical yeah we'll give you another minute to wrap this up and we'll move on to the next group of mitigation measures and if you're buing it out in hand on uh on paper in the room you can just put your number next to it to indicate the order you'd like okay so I do understand some people may have a hard stop at the hour so I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next topic you can continue working on this and as a reminder it will stay open beyond this meeting so I'm just going to tee up the next group of mitigation measures we're still looking at this high level perspective um measures that could apply across all SYM all systems this time we're focused on the operational category so we have after Action reviews we have the integration of artificial intelligence facilitating the operational plans and monitoring memorandums of understanding with the government so for normalizing what these relationships will look like and the roles that different entities will play on the right hand side we do have several um studies that are being recommended and then on the very bottom you have maturity like we saw in the last one that this last um entry is focused specifically on human CA threats so this is just in general improving the maturity of the implementation of all of those categories as they relate to Cyber attack and physical attack so now we're going to move on to questions 17 and 18 same thing as last time 17 is ranking them most important first working your way down 18 is your opportunity to specifically call out a measure that you feel like should be included if it's missing from the list give about two minutes to work on this and then I'll te up the next one e give you one more minute and then we'll move on to our next group e okay you guys can keep working I am going to go ahead and tee up our electricity sub sector so this is where we are transitioning the format just a little bit in the questions um here we're going into a bit more detail we're focusing on the subset of the threats here so we're looking at the Cascadia event human cause threats Wildfire wind storm and winter storm we have the physical category of measures on the top operational on the bottom and you might notice that some on this slide are bold these are the me measures that we found directly fill a gap that we were able to identify through the um Staker engagement efforts and the feedback from utilities and so um quickly the questions we're going to be focusing on here 19 and 20 are specific to the physical measures for the electricity sub sector 19 is ranking 20 is writing something in that's not included 21 and 22 relate to the operational measures so I'll keep the table up if you want to reference that um while you're working on those questions again I'll give you about two minutes because I do want to te up all of these before the close of the hour you can keep working on them for as long as you e e okay so thank you all for working so hard we're getting close to the end of this um topic of risk mitigation measures we have natural gas now formatted the same as electricity the threats we're focusing on here are the cascad event human caused threats wildfire and wind storm again physical on the top off on the bottom the bolded items directly fill a gap that we were able to identify the questions associated with this are going to be questions 23 through 26 so I'll give you a couple minutes to get started on those and I'll put that table back up there for your e e I'm going to go ahead and te up our last section while you guys are working um this is related to liquid fuels again the same structure here the the threats we're focusing on our Cascadia the human cause threats and then wind and winter storm the questions associated with this are 27 through 30 you guys know the drill now so you can just keep working on these um give you a couple more minutes and then we'll wrap up the e e okay I'm gon to go ahead and um present some of these final slides just to let you know for our next steps we're going to be taking all of this great information that you guys are working on right now thank you so much for taking the time to prioritize these measures for us we're going to compile all of this across all of the regions and finalize this first draft of the ESP and we'll have a project roll out in the coming months and we do want to take an um opportunity here to highlight these last few questions in slido these are open-ended the first one question 31 this is specific to your region so anything specific to the wamit valley that you didn't see reflected in the information today please do let us know about it so that we're aware of whatever that is that you need to highlight for us question 33 I'm sorry 32 any comments or feedback at all that you have we welcome it there and 33 is what can oo do moving forward to better serve your needs so from there I'm going to actually hand over to our other Odo team to walk through the project that was highlighted earlier the strategy okay so we mentioned this earlier before you keep working on the slid or whatever but uh I'm going to talk about org energy strategy so complimentary to what we're doing with energy security plan we have kind of a a larger macro level look at the energy strategy for Oregon and it's just starting out and so this is a great opportunity energy security plan will certainly inform of work we're doing on energy strategy and both are iterative they'll be updated over time which is great and so in the 2023 legislative session legislature directed us to develop an energy strategy and the reason we're doing this is Oregon has very robust climate energy goals and we need to figure out how we can do it and Beyond how we can do it how we can direct all our resources all our state agencies all our stakeholders across state kind of direct everybody working on a shared vision and so the only way we're going to be able to do this successfully is with a lot of stakeholder engagement just like we're doing here today on the air security plan there's going to be great opportunity with energy strategy to offer a lot of input get everybody involved as much as possible and so that's going to be through working groups there's going to be advisory committee that people can apply to be on there's going to be listening sessions across the state virtual as well as live so there's going to be a lot of opportunities to offer feedback and a couple of different phases to do that so we'll first start this summer we'll be doing a lot of Outreach talking to everybody about things we're just talking about the tradeoffs of resilience versus Distributing resources versus resources being farther away and the transmission lines that we need to to draw those that electricity in we want to take advantage of more wind in Montana or more solar in the southwest we have to figure out a way to get here get it here and that's a big electricity or we've got nor Naturals looking at all kinds of different ways to decarbonize their fuel structures like adding hydrogen we have dedicated hydrogen pipes when we need to develop more renewable natural gas facilities within the state and other kind of localized energy resource that certainly be taken advantage of so one it's taking a look at all these different options in the tradeoffs and doing some technical modeling but then it's also what are some policy recommendations how do we take a look at that modeling those results and what are the different so it's kind of a long-term view as Thomas pointed out energy plan is kind of looking at what are we looking at today and this is more taking look at okay we've got some long-term goals for our state to 2050 how are we going to get there and what are some different things we can test along the way and uh kind of plan for our future do anybody have any questions about that that's kind of a concept no okay great so we've got a webinar June 3rd coming up I would encourage you to attend within that we're going to be talking kind of updating on here's where we're at with the energy strategy but we'll also be H up here all the ways to engage with the energy strategy going forward here's some upcoming meetings we getting our facilitation contractor on board and they should help us R some of those me meetings and start developing a calendar which we're certainly excited about in the meantime we do have an email list you can sign up for our list and get R your",

National Library workers day you have staff as like to staff me Librarians would you any librarian in the audience would you like to join us that would be fantastic some on this side too great welcome everybody all right whereas like excuse me we start over whereas libraries are essential institutions that offer the opportunity for everyone to connect with others learn new skills and pursue their passions no matter where they are on life's journey and whereas Librarians and Library support staff bring the ne the I'm not sure what that's supposed to say the nation expert assistance I think there's a typo in there I apologize person personal service and access to wealth of services and programs both in person and online whereas Library professionals at thousands of academic governmental public school and specialized libraries in the United States provide this invaluable service to library users regardless of wraith race ethnicity Creed ability sexual orientation gender identity or socioeconomic status and whereas the library workers at the Salem public library tirelessly serve our community enriching lives and fostering literacy and lifelong learning through their expertise and commitment whereas the passion and dedication of Library professionals contribute to the cultural enrichment educational advancement Economic Development and social cohesion of our city and now there therefore I Chris Hoy mayor of the City of Salem proclaimed Tuesday April 9th 2024 as National Library workers day in Salem and I encourage all in this community to take advantage of the variety of Library resources available and to thank Library workers for their exceptional contributions to American Life dated this 8th day of April 2024 so as mayor Hoy said um passion really stood out and as you can see we have tons of passionate individuals in individuals here with us today without that passion we couldn't provide the services that we do each day at work with the amount of staff that we

the services that you all do I really appreciate you guys all thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you councelor Stapleton if you would like to come on up for the Dark Skies Proclamation and I would like to I'll let you invite up the people who are going to come up Harry Fuller and I'm not sure if you have anybody else coming Marissa I know you're here come okay thank you and I'm looking to my colleague over there uh Linda who helped get this all put together thank you Linda all right whereas International dark sky week is observed in April on the week of the new moon and whereas Salem is a growing city in a growing metropolitan area with growth and development com more outdoor lighting and whereas light pollution wastes energy increases our carbon footprint and has widespread and harmful impacts on health and safety for humans and Wildlife and whereas Salem is on the Pacific Flyway which brings millions of birds into our airspace during migration and light pollution represents a major threat to migratory Birds including um interfering with their migratory patterns and contributing to the collisions which cause up to 1 billion bird deaths every year and whereas the American Medical Association Council on science and public health affirms known and suspected impacts to human health and the environment caused by uh LEDs that emit excessive amounts of blue light and whereas Oregon's dark skies are a significant natural resource with three accredited dark sky places to date including Sun River Prim primeville Reservoir state state park and the world's largest dark sky sing uary the Oregon Outback International dark sky sanctuary and now therefore Chris Hoy the mayor of the City of Salem does proclaim the month of April as dark sky Oregon awareness month and ask the community to observe this day by becoming educated on what they can do to limit their own light pollution um just want you got be close close to this okay um so Harry Fuller of uh Salem aabon also wishes he was here um he just called him and he is packing for a trip so um so I just wanted to you know sort of mention uh Salem ottobon in their efforts as well um he just recently published a um piece in the Salem reporter if you haven't seen that um but yeah thanks so much and I think uh bringing light to this dark topic is important and uh and uh thanks for doing that thank you all right next up we have a presentation and I'd like to call up Robin dkey to for a FEMA Community rating system class 3 plaque presentation oh and we have other other folks as well just one second I'm sorry I didn't introduce you I didn't get your name Willie nun sir thank you yes yes sir uh um on behalf of the fem administrator Miss Dean chriswell um my name is Willie nun I'm the FEMA region 10 administrator uh I am administrate for Alaska Oregon Idaho and Washington and 271 Federal recognized tribes within those states which nine of them are here in or yes um what what we're presenting today uh of oh thank you sir that's a good way to do it well for those of you online um I I go by heem pronouns I'm a black male with a shiny ball head and I'm wearing a FEMA logo jacket uh to be accessible for those online thank you um but this is important today to say congratulations to the city of or to the City of Salem uh this is a a community rting system of the national flood insurance program uh of of a of three class three which puts Salem in the top 20 in the nation and the top in the state of Oregon um the which is woohoo yes ma'am it's a big deal yes it is and and this is this rating has been worked hard on uh the city of Oregon uh joined the nfip program uh 15th of June in 1979 uh about 2 and a half months after female was born female turned 45 years old this year uh but uh it's it's with the recognition of what this city has done to be resilient uh talking about free space talking about raising uh raising uh mobile home trailers to make sure that they're not flooded talking about looking at drainage protection just to make your city resilient sir and so on behalf uh what this does for uh your community it uh reduces your premium by 35% and I'm I'm originally from Alabama I've been here in the Pacific Northwest for uh 26 years uh so I'm going to do a little Alabama math in my head U I don't know what that is but go well well sir we have about 800 uh 825 policy holders for nfip in the City of Salem uh we have the premiums are worth about almost um and uh it's an Ann annual premium payment of about $727 a year and if you didn't have that 35% reduction it's about $210,000 more that the uh folks would have to pay so well done I would say as this has been in fact since one April um but she says she's already getting calls on how to do it better awesome it's really all due to Robert's hard there's no doubt about that she deserves all well no I was going to say there really has been a successful program in my experience because of a supportive Council and Community uh development Community designers and homeowners Property Owners um I feel like there's been a lot of um incentives for us to um increase and awareness and just the support of the program um we couldn't have done that without the support of this community and um the continued growth in our program um I I this is one of my favorite parts of my job that is lots of different hats but I always love this part of it and this is probably where you've seen me at Council as FL plane related but um we'll continue to strive to keep this discount for residents because we know how important it is um and then keep",

        "text": " well I'm not a lawyer and it's way over my head it's it's a bit troubling to me that we're even having it because this doesn't appear to have anything to do with the actual permit criteria which is what we're here to discuss so we we need to not be doing what something the circuit court is trying to do on their behalf we need to really focus on this this application so we might need to get advice from our legal council just to be clear Jane I would just ask micophone um to the extent that you're you're talking about easements what J hang on I'm sorry yeah what criteria um are you um objecting to are you saying that we have that uh the applicant hasn't met the burn approve on so if you're talking about the FL I'm talking about the flood plane and the criteria that the hearings officer um uh based her order on which criteria does this testimony apply to this is a foundational issue okay so not not because we're here on a permanent application so this is a lan use hearing and so I guess our request I don't mean to be presumptuous but our our request would be that you actually address the criteria you feel the applicants have not met here that would be most helpful to the okay and I will um we can get to it please okay I will just one more point on this because it and it Bears on the entire proceeding whether you can authorize this development at all is another admission by Maring County that says a property developer's dedication of a street right of way to the county does that that doesn't have anything to do with the two criteria so if the doesn't have a right to the proper I think this is kind of core to the whole issue actually Commissioners so can you tell me why help me understand your thinking because because if the public has a right to access the river and if the state owns the river then basically all this stuff doesn't matter so if if if the state owns the river and if the the um public has a right to access the river then then kind of what the opponents of this application are arguing about is not relevant to our decision- making when it comes to the actual application so that's part of the reason why I'm I'm I think it's uh I'm trying to clarify what a right of way is but I I think I disagree with Council here that a right of way is a thing like I've never heard of a right of way that doesn't confer a right of way like that seems a little bit ridiculous I'm not saying it's not a thing it's essentially an ease but the only the LA I'll move on after this but my the main point is if Maran County doesn't have a right of way or an easement over my client's property then it cannot Grant this application you cannot Grant an application to develop private property without some legal justification that is a taking but that but the overwhelming evidence in the record is that this is a public right of way right what evidence that's not what's that's not what's at issue today it's the issues of the the um two criteria uh uh that the hearings officer outline and that's what I want to stick to not not something else absolutely okay so with that background what we already know that the friends has done quite a bit to develop the property and it may surprise you to learn that the friends did all of that without ever applying for or receiving ceing a permit from Maran County on this slide is an image of the wamit river Greenway boundary which is depicted by this green dash line the disputed property is within that Greenway boundary right here so any development change of use or intensification of use within that boundary required a permit from Maring County before that development could be it is Undisputed by everybody here that no permit was applied for or obtained before the friends did this development beginning in 2017 Mr Williams just WR said it was under a memorandum of understanding that memorandum of understanding was executed 2 years after this development took place it also doesn't say again I'm going to just ask you to stick to the issues that the that the hearings officer there's two issues yes commission this this isn't one of them commissioner Cameron Under Oregon law you need to consider this project as a unified whole so we can't just pretend that none of this happened and say the only things we're considering are the gangway and Doc Luba says you can't do that organ appet Court say you can't do that you can't segment projects to avoid complying complying with the code so respectfully this is very important but in this instance the application is for a gang way in a dock right isn't that what the application is so isn't that what we're considering whether or not you you that's what the application is for but what we're telling you is that no no permit was ever obtained for the prior work and the hearings officer said well I can't consider that cuz this is only for the gang way and Doc and what we're telling you and what we've sided our submissions is Authority saying you can't do that you have to look at the entire project this was unpermitted work no one has ever evaluated the legal criteria for the work that was done in 2017 my clients never were given notice or an opportunity to comment or challenge no one has ever evaluated that work against Maring County's criteria so we can't just pretend that it never happened and we're only thinking about these two additions that's just not permitted but I feel like there's a there's a process by which you can challenge that and that's not this process right like if somebody if somebody uh goes into my backyard and starts building something right I go to Circuit Court and I get an injunction that's the process right that could be one I file for trespass and right but Maring county code also says that Maring County cannot Grant a permit if land is being used in violation of maring county code and other laws and what we're telling you is that this land is it's developed property within a Greenway without ever going through a process and the process that Oregon law in addition to Maring County Oregon sub orgon statutes require is notice and an opportunity to comment to the to the property owners my clients and that's never been provided to them so I'm going to ask you to go back to the high water mark and the the the two issues that here well are we going to get there like are you ever going to talk about that CU if not I don't know why we keep hearing you unfortunately I will I will get now very briefly because Maring County's comprehensive land use plan is supposed to guide development in Maring County so this is an overlay for the two criteria you have to consider this proposed development are supposed to align with the comprehensive land use plan and the plan is supposed to be used before a decision is made uh to invest or develop property and the development is supposed to be consistent with the plan so why does this matter here this purportedly purported historically significant site is actually not mentioned anywhere in Maring County's comprehensive land use plan it's not identified as an existing public Recreation site and an access point or site for future recreational needs it's not also not identified as a public land with Scenic and natural areas and it's not designated or identified as a historical site in rural County in addition to not being identified in the plan the proposed project fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the plan and commissioner bethl I know you just um earlier you mentioned Council again I'm ask you to get to the fact of the the two issues I'm answering the question she raised if it 5 Seconds you asked about the minimum five acres coun uh commissioner be bethl actually I asked if this was an application for a park correct and to be clear for the record the the plan defines a water oriented Park but is the application requesting a park was the question I asked I don't need you to tell me what something else says I ask staff for the clarification of an application for a park so let's stick to the two criteria I need you to address all right thank you the flood plane criteria thank you here we are I'm just going to talk about five major issues again it's all been developed in our written submissions the first we already know Maring county is not the owner of the property our clients are the Undisputed Ed fee title two Marin County code 17178 05c this flood plane criteria says that prior to obtaining a building permit the owner has to sign and record a declaratory statement in the county records that says that this property is within the flood plane owners defined by Maran county code Maran County staff and the hearings officer said that this is inapplicable because the disputed property is in a right of way there is no exception under the code and they haven't cited any so there's really no legal or factual basis to conclude that this excuse me provision is inapplicable the third issue concerns Maring County Code 17 17805 subg this Criterion basically says that the application shall include certain information about the property and the proposed development this Criterion has not been mentioned or evaluated by the friends Maring County or the hearings officer the fourth and I'm going to speak a little bit about more about this in detail but the friend's proposal to satisfy one of the criteria the no rise standard is actually not permitted by its DSL permit and finally number five the hearings officer concluded that of the seven criteria were satisfied only because they could be made a condition of approval so in each of those instances by saying that the Criterion could be made a condition of approval the hearings officer is saying that the condition was not met if the condition was met you wouldn't have to defer to later Maring county code 17178 060 subj is the no rise standard it says among other things that improvements shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community you may recall that the friend's uh proposal to satisfy this standard is to essentially dig two large holes and remove two uh 40 cubic yards of river bank to compensate for the installation of pilings the problem is that the friends doesn't have permission from DSL to actually remove this rer Bank from the river I'll point you to the DSL application and permit which is attached to as exhibit 16 to the tto Declaration the first declaration without obtaining approval state law prohibits any removal from Waters designated essential salmonid habitat",

to have a process so that low income owners could have priority in their applications for the funds that are available i also was thinking for accessibility if the department of energy could provide examples of documents needed for eligibility simple like images that just show kind of how the documents could look and that way people have a reference for the documents that are going to be needed whether that's um through like on the website having those examples up um just so that people could be more assured of what documents they'll be needing and how they could look um and i'm also uh for

it could be explicit um that it is a retroactive and other than that um i did have a um i know that it says that local government is the the entity that is going to be determining the damaged or destroyed structures but wondering um if if there's other to also determine the structures such as like the fema local government isn't always accessible to folks and sometimes it could be hard communicating with local government and if there is an issue with local government identifying people's location as a fired fire impacted home wondering if there's other entities that people could reach out to or if there's other databases that could be used that could qualify them for determining their location as a fire impacted zone so that was one of the questions i had specifically for um why it is only local government identified in that role and if there is space um to to have that open up i also am wondering uh for the household definition it might not completely apply but um there has been issues where there's landlords who have refused to give copy of their lease agreements to fire survivors or there's verbal agreements made where there is not a physical copy of the lease agreement wondering how that could be mitigated um especially with some households being split up after the fires um and they might share just one address for the the fire um their fire address before and now they might be split up so another question would also be for those impacted households that are now split up um can more than one household use the same address um if now they live separately um and then the landlord issue if people don't have a lease agreement um so that's the questions i have right now and if anything else comes up i'll make sure to add that to the chat thank you thank you that's uh great comments and questions uh the questions will definitely to go away and think about um i'm gonna move on to next person to provide testimony that would be maya jared from rogue jared from rogue climate down in jackson county oregon in the almeida and overchain fires i just have a couple things to add to my colleagues comments i want to talk about uh one barrier and my comment is around the timelines the deadlines for people to have submitted their permits and then to have completed their projects i think that it would be beneficial to extend those by six months to a year right now many people who are planning on rebuilding in jackson county especially manufactured homes are waiting on a private developer or a plot developer to to finish cleaning up and re-permitting and then improving those lots again so that people can move back so it's just not an option for them to start their rebuilding process yet and they're dependent on on timelines of the land owner i think that would improve the uptake of this program which i'm really excited about another access point and question i have is that i know some of the power infrastructure down in our area that that the actual grid or the inverters at the pole have need some upgrades when large amounts of people um in one lot or one house or on one street appliances from gas to electric and that there may be costs that a consumer or one household would be asked to pay if they were to upgrade all of their appliances to electric for a single lot um that could be around fifteen thousand dollars for example uh previously the appliances on that lot included a mix of gas and electric um and so i'm wondering if there could be some sort of contingency plan or conversation with the utility for distributing that cost a subsidy for if that power upgrade were needed at the poll in order to make it possible for someone to adopt some of these appliance upgrades that we're talking about it's sort of a a gamble as to to which lots or which houses will need that upgrade and a property owner um wouldn't necessarily that that's coming up uh until they put in their permits for um which appliances they're they're planning to to have on their on their those are um my two main comments on this plan and the last thing is one additional way to qualify people to know whether they are fire affected or potentially to know their income is i know that a number of the fire affected communities are are already vetting those through the disaster case management program that oregon dhs is heavily involved with um in a lot of communities i know that the the disaster case managers are are not able to work with every fire survivor at the moment that there's wait lists and so it's i appreciate that there's other ways for people to be vetted as a fire survivor but that might be one possible venue in addition to being vetted through the local government systems as to whether an address is fire affected thank you thank you thank you for that james i i think a lot of the questions we're getting we have to take back and we can circle back with people um with some of the answers but there was one question that was in there that i have a pretty clear answer on and i just wanted to share it and it has to do with the timelines by which the money has to be spent um the legislature uh when they um passed the bill and and gave us the authority to spend money and gave us the money they're the ones that set the and we actually subsequently realized that the timeline was far too short based on just general information about our rebuilding process but also past rebuilding processes in other places and so we flagged that for the legislature and actually at committee meetings i think in november chair clem who was at the time the chair of the house wildfire recovery committee put it on the record that the supported and recommended extending the program out so that we would have more time to spend the money and more time for people to take advantage of the program based on rebuilding rates so i just wanted to put that out there and make sure you know we have it on our radar legislators have it on their radar it does require some legislative action and um will be that legislative action would happen in the 2023 legislative session thanks christine okay i'm going through the rest of the chat and it doesn't look like anybody else was looking to provide testimony uh uh we'll take in the comments we see there in the chat as well um back um if i've missed anybody uh wishing to provide testimony um please let me know if anybody's jumped on uh as we've come along please either type in the chat chat or raise your hands let's give a moment just to double check we haven't missed anybody while we're waiting to see if any hands go up or if anybody lets us know in the chat that they have something they wanted to share um the question in here from john uh had to do with brighton bush and just to be clear this program isn't limited to residential structures or homeowners it includes commercial structures so however brighton brush qualifies in there i don't i don't think it's an issue um i think that we'll have room for for brighton bush and similar entities that may have been affected i can think of a couple of other places that weren't that are kind of in between the two um and i don't think that there's a reason to be concerned but we'll make sure james reviews the rules to make sure that that's the case i don't see anybody uh writing their hand or typing anything so just double checking that anybody's missed anybody we did get another question just now from lorraine again i think some of these are questions we can easily answer some are ones that are not as easy um james i'll let you decide on this one she's wondering she's had people explain that they're interested in purchasing a property as a group and wondering how this would be allowed or if it would be problematic at and i know if we don't know the answer then we can just follow up with her when she logged in i'm sure she had to give her email i'll definitely take that away to consider unless michael you had anything you wanted to say on that right now uh yeah i guess i would be happy to address that so we are looking at the incentives per property and so if somebody purchased a property and built a structure on it we would direct that to the owner of the property uh whether if that was a group if they filed as a group of people or as an individual we would direct that incentive to those people but the incentives are per property so it wouldn't necessarily be multiple incentives to a variety of different owners we wouldn't necessarily split that up but just have one either the business entity or or one property owner that's on the title we would direct the incentive to does that answer your question took me a second to get you unmuted i have you unmuted and i just uh michael asked you a question just if that answered your question yes um so i want to explain really quick it did not answer my question because the situation is that i'm seeing over and over again is that people um unable to to financially bear the full burden of purchasing the property and building on it so in some cases they may be able to partner with the the property owner um and um build on on that or bring you know bring a living situation on to that but um basically because the the costs have gone so high um everyone is talking about okay how can we take two or three or four families and buy a property together and build on it together and then of course the the next natural question is in what way can we apply the the grants that are coming available to this type of situation so if they're able to",

        "text": " the Water the Hardin house on Kirk Street I know Linda knows that we restored that so um we're excited about more electricity in the valley um my old man and I used to argue in the 70s during the oil embargo about the efficiency of electric cars and that's what I wanted to talk briefly about compared to he was a mobile power mechanic so we would always argue about his V8s versus my dream of electric cars because electric cars are about 90 percent efficient the the 10 percent we lose is from the friction and as you know if you work on V8s or uh internal combustion uh they're best at 30 efficiency and because we lose so much heat you know that's why we have radiators and all that so I'm excited to see a lot more efficient transportation across the country especially in Oregon and I think one of our biggest challenges is our infrastructure favors other things you know I if you look at Israel they're starting to develop electronic or electric freeways and I think that may be something we may see in the future so uh more think of like a slot car so we won't have the need for Batteries as much so I'm just here to learn more about it and and help let's say if it need to bring people together so thanks thank you uh Dan Bowers Don Bowers and then Jim Johnson all right I'm Don Bowers from Harrisburg Oregon retired farmer first question is what happened to exclusive Farm use we shouldn't even be here I don't understand that at all anything you try to do that's not farming doesn't happen in the Lynn County at least as far as Oregon I you would say or somebody off way far away from here in some other country I guess so it looks ugly it's you're putting it on Farm ground you're going to cover up Farm ground one of these days you're going to be thinking man I wish I had something to cook with all this electricity but the farm ground is going to be covered so I'm going to address so I'm going to address the first one and obviously you guys think the second one um and you're gonna be followed by Jim Johnson with the Oregon Department of Agriculture so he also may be responding to the exclusive armies so one of the council's standards is land use and as I talked about um whether it goes through the county or it goes through fsec there are you know it's it's the property is an exclusive Farm use Zone land it will have to meet all the requirements of the exclusive Farm use zone so those are all you know in Oregon revised Statute and Oregon administrative rule so we will do that evaluation uh we're far from over yeah so yeah to answer your question who is a parent company our parent company's name is hanwa yes they are South Korean but I would also like to emphasize that uh in this year it did uh actually 3.5 billion edition of our uh module Factory so we can actually double the output of what we can actually produce here in America and those panels themselves would actually be used for this project yeah I forgot to ask my question I did an intro but I forgot to ask my question which is uh the all the producers always ask how much per acre because I I understand there's a revenue for the landowner and so is that a range of per acre or anything when it comes to the leases that we sign with are landowners is not public information we did do a NDA with them so for their privacy I cannot talk about them no but can you talk about a range that landowners get per acre that that's something again I can't really speak about it does vary from County and state to um but that's that's pretty much all I can really say okay Jim Johnson's now and then um Tony Koontz again apologies if I'm getting your names wrong or maybe Tori good afternoon my name is Jim Johnson I'm the water planning coordinator for the Oregon tobacco Who deliver reviews you pointed out Todd a lot of questions to have a lot of I first like to point out that this 18 08 footprint involved predominantly valued as defined big and throw soil surveys there are actually our class one and two buildings property class one soils are very rare in Oregon yet we see those in the South Valley we have Prime Farmland within the boundaries and we also have Prime Farmland if drained drainage is a is a practice that farmers routinely use in the South Valley so drainage is not something that would be an impediment to making something Prime Choice F6 versus going to Lane County I wasn't going to talk about this but it seems like there's a lot of questions about this I'm really disappointed in the upset process because the f-sec process for taking an exception to site on exclusive Farm use Zone land is actually easier than going through the county process because the upset process does not require that that the developer to look at Alternatives deciding on high value farmlands so the the Alternatives analysis is out the window it wouldn't have been if they would have went before Lynn County and that's a policy question I understand that but I wanted to bring it up because it's an issue that needs to be settled one last point on that that really the reason that um you haven't seen large-scale projects in the Willamette rules to dissuade the location of large process the exceptions process it's not called an exceptional process where nothing is supposed to be difficult yet the aspect process is actually easier than what lcdc's regulations are um comment about dual use I'm hearing a lot about dual use we're going to do agriculture along with uh with uh solar and the like and that sounds really good enter your access code or meeting number followed by pen that sounds really good but livestock grazing especially sheep is an extensive units none of the capabilities that you could that these soils produce in terms of growing high value crops you're not going to run a combine with a 30-foot header through solar panels uh you're not going to be able to plant perennials like hazelnuts in an area where you've got soil panels so dual use sounds really good but it's limiting the diversity the ability of a farmer to change crops to to use alternate farming practices and the like and grazing is is really is about as low a value of use of this high value land that you could use Farm impacts test one of the requirements that you're going to have to meet is What's called the farm impacts test Under Oregon state law that doesn't change first off I really want to make sure that that the energy facility citing Council and staff understand and I believe you do that that analysis is now really geared towards the decision by the Oregon Supreme Court in the stop the dump Coalition versus Yamhill County and in that process I got to flip to my other notes Here several things are going to have to be done number one the analysis has to be on a Farm by Farm basis not just an overall analysis of the large area it has to be on a farm practice by Farm practice basis so there might be 40 different practices going on one individual Farm you have to analyze the impacts of this operation on each individual practice separately on each individual Farm within the analysis area that gets me to the analysis area half an acre doesn't even touch what the character of Agriculture is in the South Willamette Valley especially this area the analysis area needs to be much much larger larger a half a mile could be a half a section there's a lot of farms out here that are one Farm is bigger than that and yet the character of the area is multiple Farms doing these large-scale agricultural operations you need to take into account the factors of the type of Agriculture to figure the analysis area and a half a mile doesn't cut it the farm impacts test also requires that the cumulative impacts of each individual impact be considered for the entire area to determine if there will be adverse impacts to farming practices I think I'd just like to um to end um about Farm impacts one of the farm impacts that we've found and we haven't got a lot of experience in the Willamette Valley because we've just had small projects or whatever but they have basically generated speculative land values where that farmers cannot compete with Pharma cannot compete with an energy company in terms of how much they rent or lease the land based on that and so that is an impact to the large-scale and large term ability for Farmers to grow in this area there's no new Farmland so how do farmers expand they rent or lease other for people's lands there are a lot of absentee landowners in the Willamette Valley that land is available to Farmers that are farming this speculative land value type situation takes away those abilities from Farmers to ex to expand and lastly I'd most like to end with something that I'm always pointing out to agriculture is not only land dependent it is soil dependent it's quality soil that they need developments like this are land dependent but they are not soil dependent thank you so so I don't have any response to to Jim's comments I just want to point that out as a model so when I talked about before making comments and tying them to our Council a council standard that's exactly what Jim just did so that's our land use standard related to The Exclusive Farm use Zone he provided some very specific comments that that allow us to think about you know what are the impacts what are the issues allows the applicant to think about it as well so not that you have to make that during your comment here but if you're thinking about you know providing written comment that was exactly the kind of comments that we're looking for okay so I'm going to say Tony yeah thank you and then next will be uh Lois Hawk I live out on Gap um a ranch is about 800 acres and I've been in our family since 1860. I have mostly comments not questions uh to me this is a land use issue and it's in and it's not a state thing and I kind of kick on with the guy previously but I'm pretty sure the Linn County Commissioners are not for this and they weren't to begin um just in some conversations I have and it appears that going through this process is like making an end run trying to get past it find the easy way uh I believe in elected officials that I have some input on and certainly not appointed officials that I have no input I don't know what the law was or the I'm going to call it",

of oregon is a 501c3 not for profit for those of you on the call that may not know it we operated operate under a grant agreement with the opuc we provide comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and financial incentives to serve customers of the five investor-owned utilities in oregon so our core business is to provide incentives for cost-effective energy efficiency projects and help pay for the above market costs of renewable energy facilities under 20 megawatts of nameplate capacity since 2002 we've provided expertise and financial incentives to support installation of over 20 000 now this slides a little bit out of date net metered solar projects most of those being residential solar 46 small wind turbines 14 hydroelectric plants 12 biogas cogeneration facilities as well as two biomass and two geothermal facilities over the years we've learned and shared best practices in project development in operation to support small-scale renewable energy developers and operators the vast majority of whom are using renewable energy offset electricity used in homes and businesses next slide please again big topic i'll start with highlighting just a few of the many benefits that i'm sure we'll discuss this morning which are maybe self-evident to a lot of people on the call and involved in the industry but for examples so nut meter rooftop solar installations have enabled many oregon families and businesses a new way to manage their energy use the state's community solar program and portland's clean energy benefit funds certainly offer opportunities to expand solar access to low and moderate income communities that have previously been unable to and house bill 3141 now requires energy trust to invest at least 25 percent of renewable funds for the benefit of low and moderate income customers in conduit hydropower made possible through the modernization of irrigation district infrastructure offers the promise of using revenue from energy sales to help service debt from piping modernization of irrigation infrastructure results in delivery of pressurized water deforms and yields permanent energy efficiency gains from the removal of pumps these pipe systems also yield significant water savings and water being left in rivers and streams for fish and wildlife while also making agricultural water supplies more reliable during drought which seems to be perennial all strengthening our rural economies third biogas cogen projects at municipal water resource recovery facilities those wastewater plants of the 20th century have the capacity to transform wastewater treatment and convert commercial and residential organic waste such as post-commercial food waste into biomethane that can be combusted to generate electricity and thermal energy this process keeps these greenhouse producing materials out of landfills minimizing the carbon footprint from their transportation and enabling nutrient recapture all while generating enough electricity to often meet or exceed on-site energy needs and last benefit highlight of course these distributed renewable energy projects create local jobs help green organs electricity supply and produce many other significant energy and non-energy benefits importantly the energy benefits from distributed renewable energy facilities accrue to both the project owner as reduced energy costs utility rate payers as a whole in the form of grid services and may enable the deferral of distribution system upgrades the quantifiable benefits aside small scale distributed renewables now certainly face significant costs in challenging pathways to commercial energy trust works to support projects through the many issues that arise in the development process but our efforts in available funding cannot eliminate the barriers beyond our control next slide please first a few comments about the solar market specifically we've seen very optimistically a significant benefit to the solar market resulting in the technology curve over the last couple decades over time manufacturing of panels has greatly improved a robust network of trade allies have developed here in oregon all leading to these systems getting less expensive costs are coming down largely but there is uncertainty in costs in the residential and commercial markets such as those caused by the commerce department investigation permitting costs variable financing fees and decline in incentives the net metered energy benefits solar systems provide customers in oregon are however customers nor utilities are not yet capturing all the value streams that these distributed renewable energy systems could provide which will be brought about through wide adoption of energy storage systems smart inverters and pairing solar with hydropower biopower for example to support resilient slide now a few comments on distributed renewable development and operation first contractual and revenue related given the fairly low avoided power prices we have there there is significant preference for distributed renewables that can net meter spinning the meter backwards to offset retail power prices over those that would sell electricity to the utility small-scale qualifying facilities only earn wholesale market-based rates for the power they sell to the utilities these rates based on utility-avoided costs do not account for the societal and environmental benefits or ancillary services these projects presently current market rates do not provide enough revenue to support unsubsidized investments in distributed renewable energy generation systems leading to reduced distributed renewable second for qualifying facilities developers often have difficulty eliminating the amount of excuse me estimating the amount of power small-scale distributed renewable systems will produce yet utility power purchase agreements generally provide little leeway for under production utilities clearly need confidence in generation estimates and actual production in order to manage the grid efficiently however if a distributed renewable project fails to meet meet its production obligations even for reasons outside of its operator's control a termination of the power purchase agreement may result grid related costs and barriers the processes for interconnecting to the grid can be confusing and difficult for inexperienced developers to navigate while utilities have an important function in maintaining grid safety and late development stage interconnection and upgrade cost information and extended upgrade timelines create financial unpredictability and can be often too much for small projects to second sub megawatt projects those distributed renewables with the nameplate capacities under a megawatt for example in particular faced a number of barriers and incur additional costs and they generally face the same contractual and interconnection requirements as say a 10 megawatt project which imposes significant costs and obligations on small project developers small-scale distributed renewables that sell power to utilities typically must also pay for transmission service and purchase more transmission capacity than the projects can use together these variable costs generally represent a much higher percentage of total project costs for small-scale distributed renewables than they do for larger projects combination of high variable costs uncertain costs along with diminishing revenue opportunities creates a fragile economic environment for these projects operational costs and barriers certain distributed renewable technologies have the potential to provide significant community benefits yet also carry inherent risks and uncertainties for developers newer advanced distributed renewable technologies often have higher costs than are more commonly than the more commonly deployed technologies and have uncertain operating or maintenance because premium rates for specific distributed renewable technologies are not available developers are often deterred from investing in technologies that can provide valuables valuable social benefits but carry more economic for example agricultural or community-based anaerobic digester biopower facilities such as those at confined animal feeding operations feedlots or in urban or suburban locations may struggle to maintain consistent feedstock supplies and feedstock shortages can contribute to under production that jeopardize compliance with contractual energy production all these costs and barriers aside i want to conclude with a few encouraging oregon has tremendous potential to increase its distributed renewable small-scale deployment across the state and give local communities the opportunity to enjoy the variety of energy and non-energy benefits these technologies can provide energy's distributed renewable deployment is currently constrained by combination of factors including economic pressure technical limitations market forces etc concerted efforts to main to mitigate these cost constraints and align policy objectives and market price practices could enable significant expansion of distributed removals also small renewable energy projects can form the backbone of a new resilient energy system that could help oregon communities weather the variety of challenges they face from public safety power shut-offs to other natural disasters we hope will never strike when paired with battery storage perhaps solar and islanding technology these installations can provide backup power to maintain critical infrastructure and community services as well as ensure that local businesses remain open even when the broader utility grid is not able to function these systems when paired with battery storage technology can provide additional utility grid services that support higher penetration of renewable energy when the grid is operating additionally distributed renewable development directly benefits local communities by creating jobs and generating revenue for local community-cited distributed renewable systems also give consumers and municipalities some control over where their electricity comes from allows them to play a direct role in the energy in conclusion energy trust remains incredibly optimistic about the benefits of distributed renewables in oregon communities especially with the passage of house bill 3141 house bill 2021 including now the opportunity for government entities to use the green tariff in partnership with utilities to support community-based renewables we strongly strongly believe the many challenges can be addressed in ways that benefit our communities our utilities that provide this essential service project owners as well as developers thank you thanks so much dave appreciate presentation any questions from our good morning panel we're ready for you you can raise your hand you can ask questions in the chat oh rain feast perfect hey thank you for the presentation dave not sure if the question's good here or maybe for this will be covered later in other presentations but just kind of curious we have a good sense of what the percentage of cost breakdown would be these projects whether it's for like the breakdown between like materials labor and you mentioned like sort of reconnection and all these other process i'm just kind of curious um what that percentage breakdown uh like a top level boy it's extremely difficult giving the hot the high variability in in different projects from a 20 kilowatt in conduit hydropower project to a multi-megawatt scale um obviously with inflation right now we're seeing massive increases in in contingency fees in the in the capital stack of a project um unpredictability doesn't lead to attractive projects certainly from the perspective the project owner i wish i could give you specific breakdowns of capex of materials would be this amount this percentage and interconnection will be this percentage but i can't it's highly variable that's that's understandable that i appreciate that response and i think this is probably just a general question i'll have like i think as as you noted like as the cost for materials or technology um goes downward you know just kind of curious what that means for the overall cost of a construction of a project and as as",

you shannon i was actually a comment from ken that kind of tracks with that that i'll just mention where he said it's virtually impossible to develop the amount of renewables needed to meet goals given transmission congestion and intermittent processes and he referenced a bpa cluster study that effectively declined almost all of the transmission requests in the region and he thinks that they'll need to be some alternative to power transmission to get at renewables we need to develop as well as a far more aggressive hydrogen development policy but i'm going to flag a couple questions from brandon next and brandon uh noted that there is two studies going on at odo that are kind of referencing each other a bit in the legislative language in the bill one regarding renewable hydrogen which you're all here for today and the other um is around floating offshore wind in which there's been three public meetings and a number of sort of written comments and so the first question on how oda was collaborating and coordinating the flow of information between the two studies i can take that one real quick to say that the leads of the studies are on the same team and coordinate and talk frequently um rebecca here works very closely with jason siermann who's been leading the floating offshore wind study and so there has been some good coordination and collaboration there among the two of them and the rest of our team but the second one i think for for um rebecca is what hydrogen and offshore wind synergies has odo considered um he noted that foam meetings for public comments there was um you know within the past 12 months strong interest in hydrogen delivered to coastal areas um thank you for the the question um and that's you know certainly an area that um we're looking at for the renewable hydrogen study much of the study is focused kind of on the on the nearer term and so given that we don't expect to see any um offshore wind installations in in the very near term here in oregon to some degree those questions are a little bit farther out on the effect um but certainly that in terms of you know that also raises a question that i batted around um you know with folks before you know like um like ken dragoon and others kind of what is this opportunity if there is one renewable hydrogen to maybe serve as a a substitute for transmission and you know that area of coos bay is somewhat transition constrained you know there is a there is a a ceiling to how much you know renewable energy can be put on that transmission and so that's kind of the question of if if you know if we had an opportunity to use hydrogen as some sort of carrier for energy then perhaps that wouldn't necessarily need to constrain as much you know potential installations of offshore wind um you know if if getting more transmission isn't possible um but so these are these are really interesting questions i don't know that there's a single right answer there but those are things that um i'm discussing uh with with hydrogen folks and then with jason and offshore wind folks as well um but certainly always looking for suggestions for you know kind of more synergies there great i'm gonna go to ken dragoon um who has his hand raised and then we'll go back to some of the comments and questions in the chat uh linda could you help ken become unmuted please go ahead ken you're unmuted transmission congestion is a really really big problem there's no way we're going to build those renewables out if we can't either overcome transmission or develop renewables in a way that doesn't require transmission and that could be hydrogen there's another role i wanted to add though storage can actually help with transmission congestion if it's located properly and if the utility wantable and others that own can't figure out how to build transmission lines and in under 10 years and and can't figure out excuse me you can't seem to figure out how to even start that clock we need other solutions and that may be strategically placed stored whether it's hydrogen or batteries or some things hydrogen is good for the longer term excuse me the longer term storage needs so it can have an important role to play there if we'd start really coordinating or thanks ken um i'm just going to flag a few more comments in the chat and then get to a couple questions here michelle um wanted to to share that on barriers one of the top ones is the seeming lack of appetite for the state providing renewable hydrogen production incentives to launch projects so we can address the chicken and egg supply and use um problem um shannon agreed with some of the comments for ken about code developing renewables and hydrogen electrolysis sites and then a question from chris from northwest natural will your study look at the current and future values of electrolyzer curtailment for demand response could this value be reflected in the electricity cost for those running electrolyzers the majority of the time unless they are curtailed to free up capacity for the grid um chris that's a great question um and you know up to now i haven't um included any potential demand response benefits um or or payments kind of in that value stack but i think you raised a very good point that that should be included there um as you know kind of one more potential value stream to to help these facilities pencil out and especially um you know maybe help make that lower deficiency if you're if you're predominantly relying on curtailed energy uh to make so thank you for that recommendation yeah great idea thanks thanks so much chris um did you want to add anything more to that chris um you're welcome to raise your hand and we can put you um take you off mute um there were a few follow-ups as well from um jessica sharing the offshore wind study um link if you wanted to look more there not seeing any other questions or in the link in the chat here so i i do want to you know i wouldn't have to do a round robin or anything but this last one down here um if you had to choose you know three top barriers for production and consumption what would they be would love to hear some discussion about that now and knowing that we have an opportunity for written comment as well arlene does had put in the chat just now that some barriers are one lack of a unified approach for projects in the pipeline and second confusion on the best approach this study is giving a good perspective on um ken added a comment about douglas county pud claimed a large portion of the electrolyzer capex was offset by the curtailment ability offsetting reserve requirements good ken i may follow up with you on that that's really interesting um ken also shares a big barrier is the inability for retail loads to respond to wholesale price signals i think that's a great point ken um you know it's interesting seeing what's coming out of the the pge demo demand response test bed um you know but but certainly it's um you know we've we've spent so much of the of the life of the electricity grid with you know really focused on the the variable um you know supply side where now i think that there's more focus on that variable demand and kind of how to to smooth that out so you know you did mention um tacoma's electrofuel tariff that's certainly um interesting i haven't heard of any you know potential um tariffs from any of our utilities in oregon under development i have heard from some developers as well that the tacoma power tariff while a great idea and a step in the direction just didn't really make difference in the price of electricity um to to really kind of carry some projects over the line um and so i guess this goes back to um you know you know michelle's comment as well you know kind of what kind of incentives might be best um and is it you know is it is it a tariff is it some kind of production tax credit is it you know streamlined citing opportunities um you know i guess that there's there's definitely some options there great and i see um ken has his hand up so linda why don't we go ahead and meet him so we could add to that go ahead ken yeah thanks i'm sorry to be such a big mouth here um you know i think we we really need to think differently about the grid uh we have thought about the grid as the utilities as providing a service to the and if you connect to the grid as a load um there's an obligation to serve and and you pay as as a customer you pay for that but if we have loads that can go the other way and this isn't new we've been talking about this forever but boy there's just nothing much has happened if if you look at loads at least certain of them with the ability to support the grid and that value then needs to be recognized either through an additional tariff or or a different tariff you know it's it's just i don't know it it seems obvious but it seemed obvious for for decades now and nothing much has happened the electric utilities started depending more and more on gas natural gas for there was a big effort uh underway to get the electric utilities to talk with the gas utilities about what that implied the electric utilities were worried about the security of the supply etc they had all kinds of worries as they always do now we have the ability of not just making electricity out of gas but making gas out of electricity completing a circle that's a very utility or grid paradigm and and i just you know i think the biggest barrier perhaps today is a lack of imagination frankly we're kind of going along thinking in the same way as we've always thought and it and we won't get there we just can't get to the targeted amounts of renewables and the decarbonization targets thinking in the same ways that we've thought so we we really need you know you need to think about storage as more a part of the transmission system you",

        "text": " click on that hand again in those same places and it'll lower your hand so before moving forward on a quick recap of why we're here um aka hb 3375 i just wanted to check to see if there are any questions about the agenda today or how this meeting will be facilitated or you know if you're having trouble finding the raise hand or chat just want pause for a few seconds here just to see if there's anyone who has any questions i see that david says i'm unable to see the participants are other folks having trouble seeing the participants as well so it looks like people can only see the panelists and not the attendees okay i think that might be a function of webex so sorry about that but we will um publish the sort of full attendee list on our website after the thank you for letting us know any other questions or on the agenda or how this meeting will be facilitated appreciate that good morning this is karen brady from the oregon department of fish and wildlife and unfortunately i'm on the phone i haven't heard instructions for phone participants to get attention that's a great question thank you karen um if you're dialing in on the phone if you press star six that will indicate to us in webex that your hand is raised and then we can go ahead and unmute you and that way you'll be able to ask your question or your comment thank you for ah i i realize i misspoke it's star three not star six and we'll put that in the chat as well anyone who heard wrong for me first time any other questions or comments all right next slide please so the bill starts with several whereas statements in hb 3375 that provide information about the interest in this topic it then describes oregon's goal to plan for up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind by thirty wanna note that this is a gold a plan it doesn't have specifics on how to plan and it's also important to note that the bill does not commit oregon to deployment or procurement targets a few other states new york and california are some examples have had floating offshore wind related bills take a slightly different approach or go further with with targets like that next slide please there are four core elements for this study how odo is implementing the bill the literature review is a the first part it reviews the various studies and reports that are out there to help us understand what research is related to benefits and challenges of floating offshore wind and there's a draft literature review that we talked about a little bit at the last meeting and is available on our website as well as discussing today um the second component is stakeholder we have several state regional and national entities that are listed in the bill to consult with which i have on a slide next and then we have some additional stakeholders including those from the boem task force that have been providing feedback as well as topical questions based on the literature review to help prompt that was available on our portal and that we'll be discussing today the third component is public remote meetings to convene at least two public remote meetings with stakeholders one of those is happening right now and then finally the report to the legislature that summarizes key findings from the literature review and stakeholder feedback including opportunities for future study and engagement by september 15 2022. next slide please and click one more time thank you so earlier i mentioned that there are a few guest presenters today here are the entities that were specifically listed in the bill that odo is tasked to gather input and consult with as you can see the list is comprised of mostly intergovernmental subject matter experts that are involved with work either directly or indirectly related to offshore wind next slide please here's our timeline for the bill um if you click one more time you'll see that we're currently in public meeting number one uh you can also see some other important dates that i'll mention after this meeting where we welcome additional feedback due by uh march 25th we also plan to have another public meeting on april 7th to share out what we've heard so far in comments on the remaining topics and also discuss any additional feedback after that meeting we may have a third meeting to continue to discuss feedback if there's interest perhaps remote or on the coast um it's currently not on this timeline but we're very open to that and then in may we'll turn to drafting the report and in mid-summer we're sharing out the draft findings and then the report is due on november i think there's a typo there ah september um september 15th next slide please so our overall objective with this study is to gather and synthesize our range of information and perspectives on the benefits and challenges of integrating up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind into oregon's electric grid to inform a summary of key findings in a report to the legislature including opportunities for future study and engagement so you've heard some of those words in some of the previous slides but this is kind of how we as an agency are really looking at our so for the focus of today's meeting my colleague jason who i'm going to turn it to in a couple minutes will be sharing common themes of comments that have been received so far to help you get a sense of what the perspectives that we've heard we don't want to assume that you've gone through and like read all the comments so we're helping to synthesize that for you a reminder that our goal here is to do that synthesis of information and that's been shared in the process so that we can accurately represent them in the summary report to the legislature it's not to reconcile those perspectives during this meeting we just want to make sure we hear from everyone we'll be prompting you for additional input today by asking if you have information or perspectives that might differ from a common theme that jason shares out and if you would emphasize something differently or if you think something's missing or if you have another new thought related to the topic next slide please the feedback that was received is viewable on odo's online comment portal there's a link on the slide here and also on our webpage the slide helps this slide helps to give you a sense of the comments received so far which 22 commenters have provided comments them ranging from the members of the fisheries state agencies non-governmental organizations utilities and transmission providers developers developers and organizations through the supply chain research consortiums and national labs so now i'm going to pass it to my colleague jason to share out on the first topic for today which is citing and permitting and i'll be back when we pause to check the chat for questions and comments for the discussion go ahead jason all right i'm unmuted then i am unvideoed or on video hello everybody um thanks for coming thanks for joining um great job ruchi with getting us settled in here um the lead off topic for today is citing and which includes the initial leasing area stage currently unfolding with the bureau of ocean energy management or boem we've got some acronyms here on the the bone process is used to identify proposed leasing areas in federal waters where offshore wind could be developed this early leasing stage could be thought of as a macro sighting with more granular micro sighting of actual potential you know projects to come later on in the process deciding and permitting topic is important because floating offshore wind projects need to meet extensive sighting and permitting standards and successfully navigating a complex siting and programming process before a project can be built and navigating these processes and meeting these standards also takes time and timing is a critical critical element for meeting clean energy commitments and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change so to help us ground us on this topic i thought it'd be good to provide some helpful information about what the citing and permitting process for offshore wind looks like some information about the types of considerations and potential effects that get assessed and addressed in citing and permitting processes and some information about the existing data and ongoing research that informs citing and permitting assessments so before we jump into comments and for this topic we'll hear overviews of a few of the key processes and activities occurring in this space uh whitney howard with boehm will provide an overview of the federal siding leasing and permitting process baum has been engaging with oregon and offshore wind for several years through an intergovernmental renewable energy task force andy lanier with oregon's department of land conservation and development is in he's the department's marine affairs dlcd and andy specifically as the designated lead of the state's coordination with boem's activities and the boehm organ task force i referenced andy will provide an overview of the state's role with offshore wind the many facets of the state's involvement with siding and permitting related offshore wind and a preview of oral wind mapping tool that has a wealth of information and data sets that can factor into the citing process mike mark severy excuse me mark severy with pacific northwest national lab and rebecca green with the national renewable energy lab are partners in a project called seer which stands for synthesis of environmental effects rebecca had something come up last minute and couldn't join us today but mark is here to provide an overview of the goals of their work and how seer helps provide information about the potential effects of offshore wind which can help educate people for engagement in the citing and permitting processes you'll see contact information for all our guest speakers today so if people have questions they can follow up outside of today's meeting i'll also encourage folks with substantive questions about the federal siding leasing and permitting processes to track and participate in the baum oregon task force process and i will pause us um after each speaker um to do a quick check for any big questions and questions can also be asked in the chat and we can come back to questions um or additional input on these topics during the time for additional citing and permitting later on so if that all sounds good i will turn it over to whitney hower with the bureau of ocean management hi great thank you so hello my name is whitney howard i'm a renewable energy specialist with the bureau of ocean energy management balm in the pacific regional office and i want to thank odo and thank you jason for the invitation to present um on on bowman's activities at this public meeting today next slide so for uh to those who are unaware of of bone we're a relatively small regulatory agency",

        "text": " do you calculate life cycle cost analysis and for some of the variables that go into the life cycle cost analysis those are um specified to be that would be something that um we as an agency would would fix or would would set on a periodic basis um and those are variables like the discount rates to be used the inflation rates fuel escalation rates um and then um kind of the uh really those are the criteria those are the ones that we would set periodically um so I think with that after hopefully providing that overview happy to answer any questions on it or kind of listen to some comments with with that um let me see if I can go back to my participant list I thought I saw maybe a hand raay there but um not seeing it now yeah that was me yeah um yeah I guess can you tell me a little about the procedure like are people people are going to do the audits with their consultants and then they're going to submit the audits to Odo for review is right I'm just trying to understand oh will Odo actually be in the room as owners are making decisions about which EMS to take um we right yeah so we we would not be in in the room with the owners deciding that that's uh that that would be something that is up to the owner to contract with their qualified auditor um to to perform the audit to determine you know the savings and the costs and determine which measures and which optimized bundle um at some level we will ask for the like the audit um results to Doc to just have that documentation um whether that's through something like the audit template that usdoe has developed where you it's like a standardized way to document the um the information that's typically gathered in an energy audit or through some other way um because you know doing an audit's part of the compliance with the some of the pathways and the building performance standards so you know we might ask for proof of that audit through documentation as part of our program but we we won't be involved with the audit itself um or working with the billing owner to determine which measures they do to meet PPS compliance okay thanks and well I have you talking about the life cycle cost uh cost um analysis is this the place to talk about social cost of carbon as a way to um demonstrate viability or not of a given investment or um um yeah I think I think this would be so the um appendix X it it talks about what sorts of costs are to be are expected to be included um and what kind of savings you know so it talks about like the the cost estimate the total expected cost of implementation um including the following factors as applicable um and then it talks about costs and savings of the recommended EMS estimate the initial cost and recurring costs energy cost savings non-energy cost Savings of each measure um and then those are what get implemented and incorporated into this life cycle cost analysis so um and it you know talks about some of the other pieces that are in there too but um so you know the the standard 100 and and Washington's program um including this investment criteria don't really consider the social cost to carbon at least in this appendix it's not it's not listed Ando con I guess I'm just trying to understand where you're at on it because what's interesting about the social cost of carbon is it's going to on one hand impose a cost to society uh as measured by the social cost of carbon which would be effectively a negative on The Ledger but if someone's willing to go above and beyond in their work and reduce their uh carbon you know emissions then they should get a POS postive results on The Ledger and I'm trying to understand how Odo might do that either now or can we at least put something in the rule now that says this should be evaluated and contemplated over time and you know included when the time is right I'm trying to make sure we don't permanently exclude it at the very least well I think I agree I think it could be included now because it's a savings right so as part of the energy savings it's also it's another it goes on the savings side of things so if a measure um you investment ratio is below one including social cost of carbon might bring it above one again and so implementable right I think it's a savings top theg savings yeah I just that we're gonna have to make sure that the accounting looks it's it's going to require fairly careful account to make sure everyone reviewing that audit agrees with that m so I just I want to kind of imagine how we might do that you have more thoughts on that Alex your little your little um that was difficult to understand can you repeat your question can you expand a little bit more about how that accounting might be done and it and I'm imagining again it could get more refined over time but how might we start doing it and how might we improve it over time yeah I think the formula it's it's it's in like uh New York did something like that I think there's the formula out there um that uh so if you like similar to The Energy savings over the life of a measure you have the uh avoided carbon that then a cost Associated for the life of the measure that then would in includ would be included in the savings calculation so that's on on the savings SES if you then compare that to the investment side um you get the you get a different ratio right a different uh ratio more likely to be above one if you factor in the avoided carbon emissions through the social cost of carbon I think that could be I think um uh that could be included immediately we just have to agree on that you know the formula just like to do life cycle cost analysis we would include the social cost of carbon there and and um and I think the tool that um we you know that Washington is using has the provision even to incl include social cost of carbon so I think things would be fairly easy to implement right so I'll be done but I'm my sense is this is in keeping with the part of the statute that says we want to continue to reduce emissions through this work even though we're not doing carbon misss accounting as part of this BPS it seems that because the statute specifically talks about still wanting to reduce Oregon carbon emissions this is one way for us to do that and I'm curious about your thought odo's thought and any other of the rack members thoughts on that yeah I'm interested to hear if there's any other rack member comments um you know maybe while while folks are are thinking about it a little bit too I will maybe just for reference pull up what the statutory definition from 349 for savings to investment ratio um like so when you're calculating the savings investment ratio um it it references the ratio of the total present value of savings the total present value of costs to implement an energy conservation measure or water conservation measure in which the numerator is the ratio of the present value of net Savings in energy or water or maintenance costs um not related to fuel use or water use that are attributable to the energy conservation measure or water conservation measure um so one you know one I I think potential challenge to like requiring inclusion of the social cost of carbon because really what what that does to the life cycle analysis is it adds a future value stream right um a future savings like a monetized value of the carbon savings for each future year and then the net present value of that that future value stream is then incorporated into the like the savings number um so the you know the the definition in houseal 349 at least as far as I can see doesn't um related carbon cost of carbon saving you know it's got Savings in energy and water or maintenance costs in there too so you know I wonder if um you know I I heard your comment before Clark about like including it maybe like in there as something that we look at or maybe as an option um so I'm kind of curious to wack members thoughts on that on that approach um you know requiring it versus versus an optional look because I think you're right you know it might be useful for some building owners who want to include it within their life cycle analysis and within their value stream to to document that and show the you know for their internal organizational purposes and maybe other purposes but um one thing I wonder about is the ability to include it just given the definition statute without the clear direction to it can I ask a followup on that because yeah it was my understanding and you'll have to pull the I don't have the language in front of you it was my understand that there is a specific mention of a desire for this law to help Oregon continue to reduce its carbon emissions and whatever that language is to that seems to be the hook that would allow this provision to included and I I think it's a good thing for the rack we should test that idea yeah there there is that kind of overarching kind of guiding principle um and this is frankly it's a way to do it that is being you know is already tested in multiple other jurisdictions and it's including uh it seems like it's in the spirit of the law that I wanted to check that yes I see a couple comments coming in in the chat um about maybe preference for making it optional but also comment about agreeing with including it um so you know that you know with with including it that would you know require for every audit that's done I just trying to make sure I'm kind of understanding through the like some of the practical applications of it you know every audit that's done um would you know need to so it calculates the associated greenhouse gas emissions reductions that are associated with every Energy Efficiency measure um and then it would apply a dollar like in in tons or in pounds of CO2 equivalents and then apply some dollar value to those ton reductions and then includes that as an annual like value stream in the cost Effectiveness so it what it what it could potentially do is maybe push a a measure that isn't that's borderline cost effective or you know slightly not cost effective with the savings investment ratio and might push it into becoming cost effective exactly and I guess my my thinking is is I'm not imagining requiring it I'm imagining it being one of the options for an owner and their consultant to work with their I mean their uh audit person to to work to work with to make sure that if they wanted to do this they could but if they wanted to take",

logically look at the rules or the sections or the chapters I rearranged them in an order that seemed to make more sense however there was no opportunity for discussion staff just took what they wanted to do and did it uh you know I tried to talk to you all beforehand but their rules included that which I think is a problem additionally but we'll get to that another story but the whole thing that you've forgotten about in this process is you're talking about the applicant and the staff no mention of the public understanding the rules and the interception for them to be involved you totally lost that point you also have other parts in the process requests for additional information and the SAG comments that's a part of the process where the public can gain knowledge and information about the thinking of staff and how they are interpreting rules so the public should have some way to interject into this process because we generally have sitting around your table are the applicants those of the industry and The Regulators the public doesn't have the opportunity to be at the table because they work when you guys do your work and how can we have a fair process where the public can be involved when they're they don't have a printer seat at the table and as you read you your rules you're not making a clear seat for them at the table so I think I ask you to take a look at how I reorganize stuff it's not the greatest but it wasn't discussed the Renewables Northwest not discussed so I'm uh informal rulemaking has more discussion amongst the participants than Iraq I joined Iraq because I thought my voice might be a little louder but I find in Iraq my voice is less so I really encourage you to look at your public participation process and how you you you structure it because if you're asking people to go through Iraq on stages two and three that's going to be a heavy lift and why would I want to participate if you're not even going to give me a chance or staff is not going to give me a chance to explain what I wrote why I wrote it and how it maybe fits into the bigger picture so I don't think your process is fair I don't want to call it a sham because it is an important process and you're trying and I I'm offering these things as a friend not as an antagonist or an enemy but I want to see the public more involved in the process and I'm a member of the environmental justice Council and a part of our work is looking to make sure that environmental justice considerations are embedded in agencies decision-making processes the way this is set up it's not happening and I really think we can do a better job and I say we because I feel I'm a part of this process I'm sure some of you might feel that from the stop b2h issues that we were in opposition but man I have learned so much about how the public responds to and reacts to your rules and your process and I would like to make it better for everybody there you go those are my comments I thank you very much I know you don't speak to us or take questions so I thank you for letting me thank you for your comments Mr Kreider Nancy are there other other members of the public wishing to speak yes excuse me uh yes next I have um Irene um Irene I'm gonna unmute your mic and you are ready to speak thank you um can you hear me yes yes okay I know you can't see me I have a computer problem my my uh video isn't working but um I would just kind of like to add my support to Mr kreider's comments I think that anytime actions are removed from the a public process before the council um it fails to provide the transparency that the public really um re has requested and continues to um so that would be my first comment and um many of you uh are no doubt aware that I spent many years this is a different topic I spent many years as an OSHA trainer training about how to have effective programs and in multiple areas like um flagging ladder safety spaces all kinds of things anyway um it's about effective management programs or monitoring programs which a lot of that kind of mitigation and monitoring programs and what I know to be so is that be effective any program has to have um requirements that don't lend themselves to interpretation that they show what has to be done when and how it's to be communicated to employees and how it will be documented for making sure that the procedures are you're monitoring and mitigation plans are really the only place where the will be shown to be complying with the requirements of the the site certificate the only thing that can be determined without mitigation plans is there a decision that the developer is able to meet your standards not that they will meet your standards so effective programs should not be including comments or statements like a practical time permitted um as approved by so looking at recent newspaper articles what you will see is that one of the developers of the um Boardman to Hemingway transmission line is specific for and they have had as you know many many problems recently they've been found liable for a bunch of buyers and I would venture to say that part of the reason that they're going to be paying billions of dollars for the consequences is the fact that they did not have either an effective program that was very specific about what was expected of them that program was not communicated people were not required to follow it if it did exist and as a result shortcutting on the management is ending up costing them billions of dollars that actually potentially could result in bankruptcy for them just to to take one uh one example I you know I'm reacting to the fact that Odo is being responsible for the final mitigation plans which in my mind is the very most important part of a site certificate is what those mitigation and monitoring plans are going to include and I just wanted to read to you a few statements um I only have looked thoroughly at one plan so far and that is the draft weed management plan our monitoring plan that Idaho Power has uh provoked posed and given to Odo as of the today it's the only plan that I know has been presented and it hasn't gone to the counties yet but the plan includes such statements as they will um I'm going to read from it here they will not be required to control or eradicate weights that were present when they took control of the reads outside the right of way s occurring that were not a result of their specific actions which crew and their actions which created surface determining disturbing um areas meaning they're only going to be controlling weeds where they have torn up the uh habitat reads and there's no requirement to ensure noxious weeds do not create and disperse seeds so I know that I've presented and you've seen that the statutes require some of these things to be done for loners or for owners or occupiers of of land and one thing that it is stated in the both in the plan and to you guys is that that the Idaho Power is responsible for assuring weeds are identified in control that says in all by um as controlled as stated in federal state and County and other local Regis regulations so the the plan says that they have to comply with these and yet the mitigation plan is only meeting quote unquote fsac requirements and allows for all these exceptions including being able to have uh Odo state that they have controlled weeds in an area so they no longer have to monitor or control weeds at all for the life of the project now Idaho Power says well it falls back on the citizens then to go to the county court and get an order and have um have the courts require them to uh to do all of these additional weeds that that your plan doesn't require them to that's not really the way it works um and I looked at the monitoring and Mitigation Of Weeds for Morrow County their plan and the bottom line is these County plans they not that the the landowner has to take these actions it turns it over to their weed program so if Idaho Power is not managing and controlling all of the Weeds on their site the way the state statute says they have to then the counties are going to be responsible for it says the the county weed inspector will go to the county court they will issue a notice to the uh land owner or the occupier that they have to control these weeds um it puts total responsibility for that the only thing the landowner does is contact the weed supervisor and say we've got a problem the Lead Supervisor does all of the work for this so if Idaho Power is putting in a transmission line and as a result of that transmission line cutting through areas where there isn't currently a road or an weeds are being brought into that area that means that under your rules it says weeds are brought into the area have to be as a result of their actions that that disturb the the habitat well the action of putting in a transmission line where one doesn't currently exist provides all kinds of opportunities for weeds to come in that that Idaho Power can say this wasn't my responsibility because trespassers brought these weeds in or they blew in on the wind or animals walking through this transformation line brought them in and all of those all of those noxious weeds end up being paid for by the counties and and the rules have all kinds depending on the county there are all kinds of different requirements about how it happens but they all fall back on the counties to take care of these weeds and to meet the state requirements so one of the things that that the rules say is that that other federal and state agencies are going to support the counties and in managing these noxious weeds I have a hard time figuring out how the monitoring and mitigation plan that's being proposed meets that um standard of supporting the management of noxious weeds when it doesn't include such critical pieces as they won't allow seats um you know weeds noxious weeds to go the seed well it's not in the plan um and I the reason I'm going through this on this just one management plan is the council has by their decision said that Odo is going to be able to approve these plans outside of of the the oversight of the uh fsac they're going to be able to make decisions about what is",

        "text": " all the information they wanted to provide and went through the you know the public process and we added conditions of approval you have time to not decide tonight and have deliberations at your next meeting and then adopt order after that and we will comply with the 120 days um I think it's important to separate that from some aspects of the application which are intended to be preliminary at land use examples utilities which I think the applicant talked about they don't traditionally do a full utility plan they show how they think utilities could work same with like storm you know water storm water Etc and that's intended to be the process through land use so we're looking at in this case how's the land going to be subdivided how's it going to be served can it be served for example they show water and we have a condition that says provide water that might through full engineering be in a slightly different location for example than what they're showing but still meet our city code so some of that is a trade-off between how much money do they put into designing the site before we decide that they even have the right layout right or that they have the right density and that kind of thing so we require preliminary grading plans preliminary utility plans and this goes back to the question Council have already had on conditions all the conditions have to be related to the approval criteria some of them are things the applicant is meeting for example we say build a street through here to the standard and that is what their plans show so it's just for us to tell them yes this is a requirement you're showing it do it you have to do it at the end and then some of it are things that they'll need to adjust their plan for example there's some spots where the setbacks aren't correct they'll need to adjust that or we have conditions to you know reconfigure the parking lot to save some of the trees so in some ways the plans will change around the edges for those kinds of things but it won't be a wholesale change in the plan if they're going to propose or need to propose a larger change for example where access comes from density something like that they would have to go back through the process again as Jamie explained thank you um follow-up question on that would be how is the surrounding Community or the neighborhood association included in that or are they included in those conversations further down the road as these things are kind of worked out in the process um so the rest of it's not a public process so after this to save the it was affirmed as Jamie mentioned there'd be numerous permits and reviews that they go through which are generally technical they're not discretionary in that we need to involve the public in a land use type application they'll do public construction plans and we'll review Public Works will review all of their public facilities that they're going to build to our design standards and that's when they'll really get into that engineering that's not a public process we're not looking for comments on what kind of Standards we're going to accept for our sewer system for example the same with a building permit although people can view it on our portal and see it's going through the process we're not asking for comments on a building permit review but through all those applications the conditions of approval from land use are carried through so there's planners there's Public Works fire staff that are reviewing all those applications and ensuring that the conditions are met at each stage depending on what condition is applicable at that time I know there was a comment that conditions are maybe unenforceable but we do in fact you know apply all the conditions and enforce them throughout all the permits that's the first thing we do when we get any kind of permit in is look at the conditions of approval and make sure that they're Meeting those conditions and if not send the plans back send the plans back until they get there for right now you're welcome thank you I have actually have a question that it's more of a detail rather than a process question a couple of them um one of the members of the public testified that they were going to have to access their property via a parking lot is that true and does that really meet our standard um maybe Jamie should bring the plan back up so the the dalkey's property is is shown as the not apart and they do have an easement and the plan is for them to continue I believe to have access in that same location I'm sure the applicant can speak to it but it will be it will be it does have show parking off of that easement uh on the applicant's property can we see that see I see somebody scrolling and they're they're doing things okay shared though that yeah we're gonna get it shared in just a second and then I'll get it to the right slide I think just the site plan to show yeah he's pulling it up Jamie it's almost there here we go oh yes this this person has also found the correct slide so if you want to be a planner we're hiring So Jamie do you want to come okay I'll do it here so um yeah let me get to the site plan itself actually can I take control oh we're taking control Jamie's telling him what to do yep here we go so and this is tilted to the right so North is to the right um and if I can take the mouse here not a part there yes so right there is a you can kind of see there's a dashed line that's their current access and they're proposing that some of the parking spaces will be on their property outside of the access I'm sorry could you highlight that again I didn't follow what you sure pointed out there so where the label says Landa guard is is where my mouse is maybe in theory gonna go here we go this right here so as you come north Uplander guard the road ends today right there and they have a I think it's a gravel drive off of there so that's the currently their driveway and that's on that's an easement not their property it's an isma yes okay and I think that would be a great question to direct to the applicant the city's not involved in kind of negotiation of private easements okay we put a condition that this house still needs to have access in the future um and so that's really for the applicants to work out if that moves if it's the same Etc it's not really for the city to be involved in okay I'll ask that I'll ask the applicant while I still have you though uh so uh one of the people who testified as had questions about conditions five and seven and who pays for those who pays for those the applicant I don't know what conditions five and seven are everyone's logging into their laptops I believe it was Mr Felton and he referenced uh numbers I wrote down five and seven and one he wanted to know who pays Brian Martin Public Works director the applicant would pay for those the applicant okay we'll say for those yeah they are they do not extend down Landing guard uh where Mr Felton uh and his neighbor said question so the applicant pays for conditions five and seven yes and and really it's if I'm correct they pay for all the conditions right there these are conditions on the yes some things are oversized and if something is oversized there's an SDC component where they get reimbursed SDC I'm not sure that five or seven meet that criteria thank you are there other questions for staff counselor Phillips thank you um so just to help me understand um this process it's more of a specifics question um it would help me to understand like what's a sense of scale for the dalke's property like approximately what's the acreage on that does it say I it may not really be that germane but it would help me again what is that property zone for not the I understand that this one it was shown earlier what the zoning is but that you know home plate uh property I believe that's our residential agriculture single family okay yes um okay those are my questions on that topic uh one of the things I heard tonight was uh the people in our community who have the living experience of having you know different mobility and using wheelchairs um and they had some concerns about their the safety that they have and other people like them um using alternate routes and Mobility is that addressed in any of the 63 conditions and what are the requirements at this stage in the process to address you know those those safety issues that seem very real yeah I think uh we'll let Public Works address the street and ADA requirements on public streets and intersections good evening Tony Martin assistant City traffic engineer can you rephrase a question I mean part of the development will build sidewalks along doakes Ferry along the entire length of their Frontage and continue them to Orchard Heights along Orchard Heights because there's not sidewalk on the North side and on the west side of landiguard they're going to build a pedestrian Island across from the high school so that people can get to the high school one stage at a time it'll be marked signed pedestrian Island is there any place that we can see that like drawn out at this stage or because I'm just having trouble tracking it in my like I am as well so that'd be helpful to have a mission so on the on the map there it would be about where the H is in Orchard Heights at the bottom yes and and that's where there'll be improvements as well there'll be improvements along the entire Frontage of doakes Ferry and the entire Frontage of Orchard Heights there's no sidewalk along there today and the sidewalk will continue to the west side of land of guard and then there will be a pedestrased pedestrian safety Island to get the uh for people crossing to get to the high school and since I'm from Southeast Salem so I'm just not as familiar with this part of town but like where's the the island the race pedestrian Crossing it'll be in the center turn lane it's a three Orchard Heights is three lanes through there okay so it'll be in the center turn lane it'll be substantial it'll be and in what phase of the development process would that Improvement have to come in at prior occupancy yeah okay um and let me see if I have so there were I couldn't quite understand the the public comment um in terms of where the the incline was so much that the the people whose wheelchairs that are manual we're going to tip over um is Staff able to like I think I think what she's referring to is the intersection of do",

        "text": " tons of neodm and many things that have to be mined and these wind turbines are not recyclable that is why they end up in landfills the solar panels are the ones that I have in my house and that is how you have had here Ana was a hotel I love solar panels but what are the chemicals involved What are the risks that affect the people who manufacture it, in my understanding all of this is going to have to accompany the wind turbines in the landfills when their useful life ends and finally the lithium batteries are wonderful, they are what allow us to charge time and again our cell phones without having to overheat also allow us to have electric vehicles electric buses there is an important part of these rechargeable materials called cobalt and it takes a thousand times more cobalt to charge an electric vehicle battery than for the cell phone and how much more for the bus I don't know where most of the cobalt comes from probably from the Congo where women children have to work for a dollar a day they also work affected by uranium I think that radiation from uranium is often found in cobalt mines and many workers do not have the necessary protective equipment they touch these materials with their bare hands without gloves children listen to people who work in horrendous conditions this is called artisanal mining and it sounds good but I promise you it is dangerous and it is These conditions are terrible, the truth is that they generate very unfavorable situations for these people. So what is justice? We certainly have to work for the protection of the environment. But that involves all countries, not just some, and we have to examine it logically and realistically. that we have to guarantee these solutions that really make sense Thank you very much Thank you director Javier student advisor brennan well First I want to reiterate that I agree with some of the issues that the letter mentions in particular about some effects of what we describe as clean energy that sometimes it is not clean energy and sometimes it is not effective either, however I believe that it is part of the path towards reaching something completely clean and we must take small steps to achieve this but I also believe that it is the lesser of two evils because although we can move forward to slowly make changes to generate a better environment for students and a more sustainable environment for students or we can stay in the past and we can generate a totally unsustainable environment for students Thank you student advisor mcdotano if I would like to refocus the conversation in the resolution on climate change that we have and simply highlight the work of the students and the group of students who sent this to the board and clearly if they are there it is because both students and educators understand the place that climate change occupies in the minds of our generation So as an assistant working for forty-two thousand students it would be irresponsible not to recognize this type of problem and the changes that everyone has to make in order to help solve it and I have reviewed the resolution it seems quite simple and instructs a student committee to assisting the School District in thinking about what could make our school system more sustainable seems pretty simple and straightforward to me and I know that before this resolution and previous years our groups did their work and have had great success because it really is something that matters a lot to us students, this is simply a formalization between the collaboration of the students and the district and the district's recognition for the students, which I think is very important. Yes, Director \u00c1vila, I could not agree more with the two advisors. students we have already heard How this resolution has nothing to do Only with the connection with the students I think that with respect to the point raised that well from some point we must focus the work to be able to Establish development of recommendations for climate change and the crisis climate to be able to take actions that are within the district's jurisdiction and are key because well, we, the students can learn, above all, the facts or statements that Director Hayend raises, but providing this type of action items for the students will Raise the current work and I believe that it is going to be very effective and efficient as a way for students to continue learning and to understand the educational opportunities that have to be considered for the new generation if we have to act Now we have to be proactive instead of reactive when We also have the opportunity, this can generate a lot of inspiration because exposure opportunities are generated and we can really champions and defenders of these issues for the construction and generation of renewable energy, so I really thank the students who raised it in the district also for raising it as a to be able to incorporate it to be able to meet the needs of the entire community. Thank you. Yes, director, Yandra. Well, thank you, president. I sent you a brief summary. And you can kindly share it with the rest of the board. Let's see, this is a very important topic. We had a student who His name is Miguel Yoshi, it's the last year he started in the STEM mentoring program in mathematics sciences and he talked about the development of a predictive model for identifying algae growth in the Detroit lake that could be predict for two days So this is an example of how we can use these topics this helped on the issue of water scarcity so knowing Coby 19 also exposed us to the problems of global cooperation so addressing climate justice not only globally but locally is where we have a great role to play since students must actively solve the programs and climate justice can occur when providing a stem education a high quality science and mathematics and technology education from kindergarten to grade 12 and I think it is important to culturally nurture students so that they understand these issues of economic inequality related to climate change to inspire our students to be the future leaders in the fields of stem education and to be able to find adaptive solutions to generate a system more Green more ecological this also, especially after the pandemic on the planet, there are risks of generating a Divergent and delayed approach in terms of addressing the challenges and this is a green transition that we have to face for climate change and climate migration and also to protect another the world economic forum predicts that climate action and other issues regarding extreme climates the loss of biodiversity social cohesion will be affected we see this a lot our community for example with forest fires we can see this resolution that can be strengthened It is simply talking about quality stem education is preschool education up to 12th grade there are also many issues that we can include such as to be able to protect the climate in a sustainable way water sanitation reduce pollution climate disasters also including some issues of the food system and I think that we can in terms of the transversal in the culture generate a mitigation of global risks we really have to teach How to generate the necessary cooperation to address global challenges in our way so that we can also from the district go further of these issues and be able to allocate necessary budget resources to provide professional development for educators and staff to also generate high quality mentoring for students in the stem fields to be able to manage these programs and I think that also together with the committee we have to generate budget allocation intentionally to ensure that education is included I really believe that we are not taking advantage of the full potential of our students and we are going to generate a young generation frustrated by that with these suggestions I really hope that they are considered we can put intention and take it seriously Because We don't have much time. Thank you, director, it seems like you have a lot of ideas for the committee. Well, any other feedback, any other comments for tonight. We invite you to raise any other ideas you have. We have a month. We would love to hear your ideas soon and we have to incorporate them. But well basically this establishes the climate crisis committee which as far as I know Leal would understand is fully focused on the ideas of the students and their recommendations to the board and the District with budgetary implications feasibility of course the district is going to have to help the student group to They can create documents that serve to advance, of course, the board can also collaborate. But they always have to do with the jurisdiction of the district so that this group formed is established. Yes, director, well, there is a clarification in terms of this, is it an advisory committee or is it? a limited time committee is going to be a permanent committee Who is going to be part of this committee besides the students Is there some kind of clarification because everything That should be resolved between now and the start because well the vote is going to depend on this level of Clarity is a committee that is going to have authority or is it a committee that is not going to have any authority or budgetary implications or curriculum no no the committee does not have budgetary authority but they can be a ask us for accountability not what they can do It's recommendations to the District to see we don't have to have all these details at the school board level to be able to pass a resolution but I think between now and next month we can work to answer these questions to the greatest extent possible any other comments Well then, if you want, you can raise the comments soon, I will circulate all the ideas, director, to the rest of the board, something else. Well, then, let's move on to point eleven, which is the standard information and reports that I submit to Perry. Well, I simply wanted to highlight some issues in the report. monthly monitoring as we are reaching the end of the school year and you will see that there are some trend lines that look good from this report I think it would be good maybe even in June when the school year ends to see what this data tells us So it is easier to see month by month but if we don't see where we were and where we are going it gets complicated well some highlights I'm going to start on page four which is quite general But well if you look at page four we have some discipline incidents or you will see that The primary school children last year were quite unregulated and there were some incidents of physical history although",

        "text": " you don't have to hear me read that entire rule ordinance name um land use regulations in Criterion three requiring a two mile setback between wind turbines and Rural residences on efu Zone land our applicable substantive criteria within the meaning of the council's rule that apply to the project and that the project does not comply with Criterion three so that was issue one and number two that the project is required to obtain a conditional use permit from an I think we dig into those a little bit more on the next slide so let's go to the next one so the the way the issues were framed for the contested case are here you can see issue one again is really stated in its most simple terms it's whether the County's land use regulation that I'm referring to is Criterion three um is uh an applicable substantive criteria within the meaning of F sex statutes and rules that apply to the um issue 1.1 is a is a sub issue because you only reach it you know the hearings officer only needed to reach it if the conclusion to one was that Criterion three was applicable substantive if it is whether the project complies issue two that the hearings officer considered is whether the project is required to obtain a conditional use permit from the county next slide so you can see here and you have the proposed contested case order analysis you you have the order in your materials you can see here sort of some highlights pulled out with regard to the hearings officer's conclusion on issue one um what's important to understand is that the hearings officer concluded that um that in this case Criterion 3 is not an applicable substantive criteria within the meaning of the council's governing statutes and rules the reason for that is that essentially you know the I'm just looking for the rule language here that that the applicable sensitive criteria in order to for a local ordinance to rise to that level it needs to be one that is required by Statewide planning goals and here the emphasis also in the hearings officer order is that that that definition of applicable substantive criteria should have the same meaning throughout the statutes and the rules it may be used in slightly different ways for purposes of clear legal interpretation should be given the same meaning in all of those contexts um the hearings officer concluded that the Criterion 3 is not an applicable substantive criteria because it is not required by the Statewide planning goals and therefore does not apply to the next slide issue 1.1 is sort of the sub to that umbrella issue one and the question was if so whether the project complies with Criterion three um you know I go to the hearings officer analysis conclusions of laws presented that uh the project does not comply with Criterion three but otherwise complies with applicable Statewide planning goals so there's I think we'll come back to that goal 2 bullet later but the real important piece here was no it does not comply the the project does not comply with Criterion three but otherwise complies with applicable Statewide planning goals next slide on the issue designated as issue two the hearings officer reached the conclusion that the applicant is not required to comply with Criterion 3 in order for the county to issue a conditional use permit again it really this is a slightly you know angle on the same issue because Criterion three is not an applicable substantive criteria for that same reason that the project can meet the land use standard and the hearings officer's opinion by compliance with Statewide planning goals it also is not something that the county must issue a conditional use per match for in this context and so applicant is not required to to comply with that in order for the county to issue the conditional use permit next slide so at this point I wanted to just sort Stack up a little bit and just put in context a bit so the issue statements that we reviewed and alj's conclusions are important for you to understand well before we turn to the County's exceptions so I want to make sure that we take that time and if you have questions that we we go over them from a big picture perspective I think it's important to recognize that the contested case here was on up this one fairly narrow issue within the land you standard and with regard to Umatilla County's ordinance the proposed order did address some of these same issues because they had been raised by the county in the draft proposed order and in the contested case process the hearings officer and recognizing that these were essentially issues of law um has styled the contested case order you know a determination on motions for summary legal determination so in this case the parties have all had opportunities to file opening briefs in support of a motion for summary determination by the county on these um as well as responsive and reply briefing and this alj and the order that you reviewed um you know it was based on that uh cycle of briefing that the alj reached the conclusions that we've just gone um essentially the conclusion um that the alj reached was that you know that that essentially the the proposed contested case order agrees with the department and the applicant I think the easiest way to kind of back up and understand the approach taken in both the Department's recommended proposed order and this hearings officer order which agreed with the underlying order is that there is sort of a belt and suspenders approach in the sense that there uh the the sort of governing finding on the issue is that as a matter of law Criterion three is not an applicable substantive uh under both ors-469 504 and the oars because it is not required by the Statewide planning goals um you know when applicants um well when applicable substantive criteria are identified by a special Advisory Group for purposes of review of an application um on the land use standard um the the ordinances that are put often have been required for that jurisdiction to adopt in order to comply with Statewide planning goals so you don't often see this analysis that's happening here about whether an ordinance is required by a Statewide planning goal but um I just note and the the underlying orders also note that that is in fact you know Central to the conclusions that the hearings officer reached here because the statutory language is quite clear that that the applicable sub opposite criteria required by a Statewide planning goal is sort of you know that is how that term um is is defined and so that is just a little bit of additional context and that the the Belt part of the recommended contested case order is that conclusion number one that this is an inapplicable substantive criteria the suspenders is that in the the hearings officer also felt that it was prudent to recommend that the council find that even if Criterion 3 is an applicable substantive um that this project application nonetheless complies with Statewide planning goals under 469 504 one little B Big B and subsection five you'll be hearing about this from the party so I'm not going to go into additional detail about it but I just wanted to sort of frame it for you as a sort of a finding and an alternative um and the exceptions hearing that um we're going to go through also attracts those same alternative findings so does anyone have uh questions in the thank you questions anyone I see head shaking here Jordan you okay you have any questions and they always said he got dropped off all right thank you thank you secretary Cornett I'm chair before we go on break I just want to make an announcement for reasons that I'm not going to go into we're going to continue to have issues with the WebEx today for some reason it's going to time us out about every 40 minutes um it should only take a couple of minutes to reset and go back on so my apologies for this technical problem for those in the room and those online just um that it'll probably just abruptly end Nancy will be tracking that we will cease uh you know any any of the activities that are going on and then we'll resume as quickly as we can okay um so thank you for that uh that warning and I would just say that this is one of the uh the downsides to a benefit more people are able to participate by our hybrid options and we just have to accept some of the unpleasantries that go with it so um is there anything else that you have at this time I don't think so I think we're scheduled for a break before we move to the next portion okay council members any questions before we break all right well the time is now 9 29 so we'll be extra generous instead of 15 minutes we'll go at 16 so we can resume at 9 45 a.m We are in our recess thank",

        "text": " They're going to have to put a vegetative buffer on this side. Okay. Okay. The building will be. What kind of building? As long as that meets Florida building code for a commercial structure. I don't know if it would be block, if it would be a steel building. I'm not sure what kind of building. That's not something they're required to tell us. Can I ask just to clarify something with the current zoning I'm not sure if you understood this conversation. The zoning that it has doesn't meet the land use that it has. So the county's trying to make it comply so it'll be compatible. But if we'll say the m two zoning, what could they put on there? If it stayed m two zoning, what could they. They could put that warehouse on there. Well, with b two zoning, it would be any. I mean, right now, this has b two zoning. With commercial land use, they could develop this right now and not have to request anything. But because they're asking for a warehouse, which is something that's normally not allowed in b two, it usually requires a b four zoning. That's what's triggering the special use. So in current zoning, they could put another build in to do, to sell something without having to do come in front of anyone. So that's what they're allowed to do. Right off the bat map, her home is right here. Over there. Yeah. He owns this property over here, which does not have a residence on. What is the zoning on that property? This property, I believe, is b two. Oh, that's b two as well that she owns. Yes. So the property that does not have a home on it is b two, the property that does have a home as b two and three reals. So basically what they're trying to do is make that piece conform with your piece. But how did my piece get b two? Well, that's a question. You know, you may want to stop, make an appointment to come in to see staff at their office and. But that we can't. We can't just bring that up or discuss it here, because that's not part of what we're doing tonight, is what yours are. But probably, if you're not aware of it, a trip down to see them, get somebody's card, and before you leave tonight, business card, and call them and try to either talk to them over the phone or make appointment, come down and see how that all came about. It was residential before the house. I know, but we can't. Unfortunately. Unfortunately, we can't have that conversation in this meeting about your property. But they're great to do that and to. Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Amy Rowell, 13474 southeast 124th place Ocklawaha. And I own the property on the other side of where this building is at 13470 East Highway 25. I really just came to find out what was being planned, and I'm satisfied with what I've heard. So thank you. Okay. Thank you. All right. Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition to this? I'll close the floor to public comment. Does anyone here have any additional questions for staff? We'll need to tackle this in two motions, correct? Yeah. So we'll handle 1.5, the zoning change. I was kind of wondering if I may take a look at the. Looking for that piece of paper that. No, the one that shows the surrounding land uses and the, you know, the north, south, east and west on this. What is your. Can we pull that back up again real quick? Sure, if we can have a screen. So subject parcel here to the north, south and east is commercial and to the west is high residential land use. Let's let him. Okay. If we can. You're good? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Yes, sir. Mike B. I agree with staff's findings and recommendation. Hereby recommend approval of the requested rezoning based on the following findings of fact will not adversely affect the public interest, is consistent with the Marion county comprehensive plan and is compatible with the surrounding land uses. Hey, we have a motion. And we have a second. Aye. Any bonner second? Motion for approval? We have a motion. A second. All those in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? Seeing none or unanimous if we move right into 1.6. This is the special use permit for a warehouse in the b two zoning. And this had conditions as well, so we would take that in consideration in our motion. I, Jerry Lorenko, agree with staff's findings and recommendation. Hereby recommended approval of the special use based on the findings along with the conditions is consistent with the land development code and is consistent with Marion county comprehensive plan. Okay, we have a motion. Do we have a second? I might be our second. The motion. Motion and a second. All those in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? Hearing none. Motion passes unanimously. All right, if we can move right into 2.1, please. Anyway. Orchid growth services, case number 240704 Su. The owner is Olivia O'Quinn and Marvin Davis. Their agent is Cindy Vols. It is located out near Salt Springs at parcel 10720, zero, seven or 00202. It is 34 acres in size and we have notified 20 people, but so far have received zero letters of opposition. It is a special use permit for an accessory structure, a barn or enclosed barn like a detached garage on vacant property and r1 zoning. Here you can see the property and the 40 by 50 foot structure on the property that was built without permits. And that is the reason we are here tonight, because it needs a special use permit to exists without a primary structure. The owner lives across the street at this location here. As you can see it is r1 single family dwelling for the zoning and it does have a rural land use. And here's a different picture showing the applicant's home and yard. And then the accessory structure that was built here is a site plan showing how it is approximately 50 foot by 40 foot or 2000 sqft. Here's another picture of it here. And there is a road between the house and the structure. There is a code case for a structure without a permit. It is about 50 foot by 40 foot or 2000 square foot. Staff is recommending denial because of the size and the placement of the structure. In the future, if the structure with the structure where it is in the size that it is, the property will never be allowed to have a primary structure on the property because r1 all of the primary structures are in the front so the accessories have to be to the rear or to the side of the primary. And with setbacks of the primary structure being 25ft from the front, 25 from the rear, there would be no place to place a single family home on the property unless they converted this structure into the home. So with that staff has recommended denial and I believe the applicant is here. Question. Staff looks more like a garage than a pole barn, but right it is. But for what it was and we'll let the applicant speak. Is there, are you. If it's denied, are you going to make them take that down? Is that what's going to happen? That would be what they would need to do. Okay. Is it at all possible for them to permit it? Maybe, if you will, whatever it take and then have some agreement of some sort that there would be no house built on that. Is that something? That's. If the special use permit is approved they would be allowed to get their permits for the structure and there would be an understanding that in the future there's a property in the neighborhood that would always have this structure on it as an accessory use because you couldn't. You wouldn't want to say if they sold it then the special use permit goes away or anything like that because you still have the same issue of there's an accessory structure that's very large and no room for a primary structure, but they could pull permits to convert this into a home that meets the Florida building code. Okay. All right. Thank you. Anyone else have a question for staff before we call the applicant forward? I do. When was this? When was this constructed? I do not know exactly, but I do know there is an active code case on it today. An active what? Code case structure without a permit. So I'm guessing it was built recently. They don't know when it was constructed? I do not the applicant be able to tell. You can ask, is there electric to this building? I do not know. Because there's no permits. I don't know. Okay. Is the applicant present? We're going to ask you to come up and state your name and address for the record. And if all three are going to speak, if you wouldn't mind, whoever else is going to speak, they could write their name down on the clipboard. I got a question for staff real quick. If I made. And let me just finish this. Are they cited for a code violation? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Just one speaking or more than one? Just two. Okay. So you just. If you can one speak and the other put their name and address down and then vice versa, kind of make it go along a little smoother. My name is Olivia O'Quinn. My address is 15271 Northeast 243rd court there in Salt Springs. We purchased this home just in January, I'm sorry, December of 2023. And we purchased the parcel separately from our home. When",

        "text": "e e right okay let's try that so I was just discussing what supplemental low activity waste is uh the basis of my presentation being grounded a lot in this massm study that you can see here and uh that it's freely available online you search for that I want to discuss why this is important for Oregon we've touched on that a little bit it will most likely be transported through Oregon one form or another um we're going to go through a bit of the evaluation of the trans transportations uh how we look at that what is the relative risk of a train load of these items coming through Oregon and we might take a brief time to look at some of these externalities what positive benefits could there be for Oregon if one method say gring was chosen over transporting liquids to be grouted off at a separate site so these Keynotes that came through in this nasm study is that most of the materials to be grouted would be what is called Class A Waste we'll talk a little bit about that but that is the lowest level of uh radioactive waste um or considered more safe for transportation but 80 to 90% of this material will be a Class A waste that is the type of waste that is acceptable at CL Utah CL Utah also happens to be the least expensive place to take this material not only is it closer uh but they have the capacity there to accept it and they have the proper controls we talked about why we want this off of site right they have a much better design disposal site um The Roots proposed in this study to run through or I'm not take run straight down to the sh river through b into clim of Falls and down south I'm sorry what could go wrong then into California and then it cuts the path over into um we in this study and we will continue advocating this is we need more analysis of the treatment locations what are the relative risks what are the benefits what are the costs we need to know what kind of Transportation campaign is going to happen what kind of support we can expect from the do uh so all these differentials go into making these decisions um there will be a weir we talk we may not have talked about a little bit but um waste in s processing decision that the doe makes before it declares a material is not a high have to be more of that done uh for any of the new materials that have come up through the holistic negotiations and eventually there'll be an environmental impact study in all likelihood a new one because there are there's a fairly extensive modification and I personally would like to see one uh as to Oregon St on that we are taking a weit and see approach that's our right now you can see up there this map and for the very top the slide and almost all that is order till it takes the right after it's uh exited in Northern California this is important for us to know five Utah look at these costs is only about $37 68 per gallon this was as of I want to say 2022 so in the land of inflation I'm sure it's going to be High um some in this study itself they based the lot their numbers off of the $45 together but the the big costra for this material is where the gring is done is the gring the material itself to actually put it in the ground in a hole what was quoted was $1,604 per cubic meter this is if I'm not mistaken approximately if I did my math right with grouting conversions 1.8 uh to one a liquid to grout mix and densities and all the happy stuff you're looking about each cubic meter having 147 to 150 gallons worth of uh low activity waste being um there's a few things we said that is such a big cross trer wouldn't we rather do this in the local re region maybe we'd get to retain some of that value that we're putting out there in this material that's one potential positive externality of doing it locally you need to grab it on site next slide and we see here in our graphs that big green bar the cost of cementing the material that's just mixing it in with tiny purple bar now mly it's not a tiny it's over you $1,000 per cubic meter little tiny is just putting it in ground now there is a difference uh now you can see that I start a few things like permix permix does not have a dis disposal cite it's not a disposal cite so it gets a start is in Richland it is in richand so they are a company that specializes well in Perma fixing things mostly by grouting it and then sending it back up to one of the landfills at Hanford or elsewhere um so I kept that saying okay well they will choose the least expensive route it's probably going to go to CL say that will stay CL also WCS it's still double St WCS they did not provide a specific price per gallon to gra material um so I assume and I know this is a bad assumption I assume that the greater cost they did provide $60 per cubic meter put in the ground if that same ratio is applied to the cost of just cementing that material that's how much more on the green bar so it was approximately 2 7% if I'm not mistaken um I know that that's going to be a high hey Matt for comparison purposes what in the uh low activity DF law what is the c you know equivalent cost in glass that has not been well defined you need more than an envelope to C that yeah I I could easily put another slap another zero up there conceivably because that was the whole reason behind this law is there's so much extra water being produced that they do not have the capacity to vitrify it's just not there or we would be running this Mission my great great great great grandchildren put another zero on your Generations we' still be running this this other slide now there's two different numbers that's not too important for now it represents two different times to start the gring but it's important to note from this slide differentiated between liquid and solid materials so what we're seeing here is that their cost their estimated cost on site is not that far different so okay so we'll gra all send send it all outside and get gra the gra by liquid or we'll grow it out here and then send it offside so send the solid there's not too much difference in these numbers if these numbers stay true it would be very hard to really say hey this is why you need to grab look at this value proposition there's not much there from these numbers and I couldn't find much to pick apart in the nas study not say yall Matt when you say off uh on site you're not referring to perix you're referring to building a grout facility at H that is what I mean I I mean I I do understand that there are certain individual uh groups that may have issues with perix taking on some of these tasks I'm sure they be very interested in doing that uh but when I say onsite I mean on or within the hand confines that before moves over borders where I'm very very per does currently have per correct put you on the spot so I think the issue is we need anded which we're actively working getting very close so I don't that's end of this year next so the potential remains if they are approved and they do have the per they could potentially bid this that's really stupid conceptual question uh how big of a lift does it seem like feasibility standpoint for get getting some technicalities worked out or is it qualitatively different that will kick off on site perix um has capability of doing um I don't think we are done efficiencies between us and on the and necessary information has to go out in so there issue public will be able to like a details thing not to invent a whole new technology yeah so also did um associated with the test initiative the initial they could do there that was in tenness it was likely sent a tenness sh they Shi the liquids to toe and then grab it one more point about in Richland you still have to move liquid waste to that facility right from the h site to Richland to then ground so that is correct there could be capacity issues there they may not have this I don't I'm not a per fix expert they may not have the potential this now maybe with their permitting schedule they're looking to expand operations I'm not sure and I thought did it there are some materials that are sent to Tennessee uh for further treatment they tend to be if thought if I recall correctly they tend to be materials higher than recur content yeah I was talking just about the three gallons that is done under it could uh something that we have to remember is live Utah accepts Class A perm uh excuse me WCS accepts all three classes so it is conceivable that to simplify transportation for some reason I not what I would choose to do that you could send everything all the way down to Texas and if that is true the route to Texas does not run through at least to my knowledge at this okay so transportation we talked about classic a lot of this material is going to be classic 90% of that 56 80 80% of um the 100 million gallons to 90% of that 56 million gallons is going to be Class A that means more cost effective it's short transport room I expect a push to take this to cly newon um down here you can see an ISO container or a call yeah I just called ISO containers I'm trying to remember what the acronym is I want to say International standard no standard inter Intermodal yeah so here are my assumptions I'm assuming that this class material is going apply have long trip in or trans ver State um and since class day majority of this material is going to be going or we have to keep in mind also some of the safety aspects of grout why would we want this gred up there well it's naturally self self shielded the radioactivity inside that material is blocked by having that extra gra right can't get through the concrete it's abor uh when you mix it with gra it's also diluted so it's a further safety margin you have danger in this mat when it comes out the tier systems or these systems that remove the cesium instru this material have to go through first all",

        "text": " within that application phase if there's you know if there's a check box for are you in an opportunity zone that is really quick and easy um or are you you know maybe there's some other designation and if we think of this in terms of check boxes for communities to kind of take a shortcut in the grant application maybe that's one way to look at this um ariana i think brandy was ahead of me oh thank you i i think that you just took her hand and so ariana and then quinn and again sorry if i missed the order up so i think because opportunity zones have come up a couple times now it's just worth naming that opportunity zones are a complicated issue in particular for indigenous black and brown communities and in particular lower income communities who are likely to be uh by investments that have been historically tied to opportunity zones i think there are ways to leverage some of the tax credits but i think if we want to use an opportunity zone as a of need from a community it would feel better at least from my perspective if there was some question the application related to and this is perhaps more of an issue in more densely populated areas like say the kali neighborhood in portland where verde does its work than rural areas but i know displacement is an issue and role in coastal communities as well but being able to say like if this is an opportunity zone that has been fitting from this project how will that community remain stable because of this project how will become more resilient not only from like a a grid or a climate perspective but what are the potential benefits that keep that community stable and whole and that a project leveraging an opportunity zone doesn't necessarily lead to displacement similarly i think there's an issue with workforce how is this employing folks and creating opportunity in that opportunity zone um so that's a little bit of a trigger for at least from verde's work perspective and i think it's just worth acknowledging the nuances and some of the harm that has been done in the way that opportunity zones have been leveraged in the past thanks for sharing that yeah that's really good to know and you know if there's other designations that are already predetermined within communities that are useful those are the types of things that we'd be interested in too and maybe opportunity zones are not the right one or maybe they are with these but anything that provides kind of a shortcut to to demonstrating these for a community to you know get to get the benefit of work that maybe has already been done so quinn yeah from from the streamlining the the grant process perspective i do like the idea of having you know some check boxes with some direct links making it as accessible as possible for people or for applicants to find the information to find out you know what metrics they're they're meeting or not you know to that end i was looking at some trying to find some comparable programs and i was looking at you know requests for proposals uh you know for other environmental justice small grants um it might be helpful to you know as some materials that would be helpful for me anyway would be looking at what other grant programs use and that might be a good starting point for us and then to say here's why you know we don't want to this one in oregon here's why we might want to incorporate this one here um but just to have you know a lot of this work has been um looked at through other grant programs so that could be a really good good starting place for us um but regardless i do like the idea of maintaining this ability to have a narrative for applicants to define what community is with a really broad definition of narrative um you know because for some people a written narrative might make a lot of sense um for some people a spoken one you know either in person through an interview or from a video so i think that combination of things could be really important because the numbers can only tell us so much yeah that's a good point to not go overboard with the check boxes in the in our kind of application process and to um to let a narrative describe situations is going to be all right um let's see here i'm going to scan the don't see any oh um keisha i have uh just a quick question because i i struggled with these two questions when you think of the applicant and um the assumption we're making here you know the questions that you have are about the status of a qualifying community and you're saying should applicants be responsible for that um and i i'm guessing we're thinking about partnerships here but it's just you know if a city is doing this this isn't going to really that the question isn't the right question for me if i if the city is doing it right um i don't know if you're getting what you need to get from these um i'm just a little thrown in some ways by the the framing of the question it's just me that's struggling there but and it might when will when are you thinking this applies is it if you have a co-applicant that co-applicant needs to be able to to demonstrate that they are a qualifying community municipality if you're bringing someone in i mean because it seems like then that goes back to actually the previous questions about the community that you're serving and who's and where the benefits are accruing so just some clarification for my benefit yeah and um that that actually i think it's a good time to to step back and recognize that and and ask the question did we ask the right questions and um the answer is almost certainly no that we didn't get them all and so reframing these in a way that is more useful is certainly task for this group that would be helpful to us and so in in my own mind when when i was thinking about these questions it was you know if a city is an applicant a project is still being located within some specific location of that and that project um depending on you know kind of the nature of of what benefits it's bringing the may have a very pronounced local impact like a local water filling station and charging stations and a warming shelter or these types of things that are kind of the walking distance benefits or it could have a really broad reach like the county hospital where you may be having you know people from 50 or 100 miles away benefiting from from the resilience and renewable energy benefits of a project it's a really good question and i think we want to just make sure that we have rules set up enable us to take all you know take a stack of projects and make sure that our rules are are set in place so that we're able identify and and reward the best ones in the scoring matrix um or the the process of this competitive review um but yeah that's a good point and if if anyone ever wants to take a shot at rephrasing a question or kind of asking a totally new question to guide this discussion please do i don't know if that even really got at the point you were trying to make keisha so if you if you have follow-up please chime in because uh you know it's a really good question and uh i want to make sure we we get at the heart of this well and i mean i think it just really is a situation of for me like i said just if we're talking about a municipality is applying for for this they're they're an applicable they're an um eligible applicant regardless right they don't necessarily have to meet the qualifying community but they need to be able to demonstrate if they're one if they want to be considered for a certain part of money they need to be able to demonstrate that the money that the benefits are accruing to a qualified community and so just having clarity as we're thinking about this or writing the rules making sure we're making it clear for applicants that they're not having to prove that there's something and unless i'm misunderstanding it and that could be the case yeah no it's a really good point i don't know if anyone else wants to jump in and and um kind of respond to this i was trying to read through the i i think i think the issue is the question on your the very first question there should applicants be responsible for demonstrating their status as a qualifying community but the the people who can actually apply to this are tribes counties municipalities ports consumer-owned utilities many of which are not going to be as in full entity a qualifying community there may be aspects of the community within the community if that makes any sense so i think it's just there's confusion there of saying well if the applicant is a city or a county let's say it doesn't have to demonstrate the whole county as a qualifying community or you know how does it go about like showing what you need to see if it's that big of an applicant yeah so maybe rather rather than a question of status it's a question of demonstrating how the benefits are are flowing and um i see adam that you've come on camera i don't know if you want to chime in here yeah good afternoon everyone adam schultz organ department of energy this has been a great discussion i've been lurking mostly um but i just want to i just wanted to chime in on this question because i think it's an important one and um it certainly came up uh as as the legislature and stakeholders i think we're thinking about this bill and i think the vision was that the applicant would be that public but then it really references several times kind of the ability to partner with community organizations non-profits and um it's really just sort of the way i think about it is that the applicant is bottom line in the application but you know there certainly could be particular communities some subgroups within a particular government jurisdiction or um other boundaries whether it could be a consumer utility whatever it is who might uh fit the qualification of qualifying communities so um that's sort of how i how i think about it you know i can and i can envision certainly you know to get into the administrative burden question it was raised earlier you might have a energetic engaged community organization who's willing to really lean in on developing the application and it's the city who kind of um like i said kind of bottom line that application at the end of the day yeah that's some good insight into kind of the formulation of the bill and i mean ultimately these projects have this community benefits component but they also especially with resilience projects they have this need to tie into this sort of critical infrastructure and that might be water waste water or hospitals or",

        "text": " have been looking at and we'll look at different ways that we can clean up and expand our contiguous related ag in order to strengthen sort of the base one of the things we've looked at is different uh recreational and hunting programs that would be incorporated in that we could continue to utilize in connection with the land and like most farmers we've got lots of needs for repairs of other buildings and and intend to use payments for that purpose as well for us the project will not as we project result in any reduction in the amount of employees that we have to the contrary we actually expect we will add agricultural jobs in one fashion or another because of the different things we'll now be able to do that will support and continue our agricultural venture we also expect to maintain and increase operational spending with local producers with local business peoples grain companies with fertilizer companies with others that are not in our ownership but are around this community it will actually provide more money for us to do things that i'm not sure with the price of fertilizer and diesel today from what's happened in the world in the last six we'll be able to keep up with that either but that will for certain put us in the ballpark to stay going so we uh so we appreciate that uh so uh uh in short i'm gonna quit with that but i just wanted to give you an overview of our ranch and we'll be around if people have questions to ask about it and it certainly is a project that we too uh like capital power have worked on for 10 to 15 years in order to get to this point and so it's an important project also for us thank you thank you mr corey just for the record could you spell your last name i can c-o-r-e-y thank you does anyone with counsel have any questions for mr corey okay i'm not hearing any thank you mr thank you see mr mcmahon were you gonna was he gonna make a statement as well thank you honor tim mcmahon here um and uh i will try to keep my comments pretty short i submitted a letter to the council uh earlier this week i think along with um an attachment and so what i don't plan to do is to go through that letter um although i'm happy to answer questions now or later about the letter that we've submitted um and uh but there are some some key reasons that we want to just make uh and understand from the council standpoint you know sort of how the stan how the council's view of implementing goal three exceptions may or may not be evolving because we have some concerns about some presidential issues and how applicants can kind of replicate a successful opportunity to make it make our way through the processes so that's really what i want to focus on here and again i'll try to keep this in a five minute ish range but um this is what happened to my notepad when i sat there listening to everybody so i'll try to try to keep on point this has been a long project a long duration and i've been involved with this project from its outset and it has been a thrill for me to watch this project evolve and change and become what i think is truly one of the great renewable energy projects for the northwest given the kind of hybridization of the technologies that this project can deploy and the ability to essentially deliver base load power with clean energy it's pretty awesome project and one that i'm very proud to stand with um we firmly believe that the evidentiary satisfy the goal three exception here we worked quite a bit with mr corey and bob levy as well on um on having them help us to to to not only make the case but to prove that this project delivers more than just an income stream to a landowner so this project really i think is a fairly quite an exceptional project um we i have been at several council meetings i have heard mr jenkins and um mr howe uh talk about the need for applicants to do a better job with goals through exceptions we listened to that um and we understand it and we have worked very hard with odo with the landowners with our consulting team with lynnea foster's team at tetra tech to do the very best job we can to articulate how this project does stand out and does meet and succeed for goal free exceptions but here's the things here are some things that i am just a bit concerned about the issue of goal 3 exceptions there's a history in discussion with sort of some loose use of the term and i'm guilty of loosely using that term myself in fact in the letter i accidentally used it again um but but i do i do think it's important to ask ourselves and for the council to consider what that means does uniqueness only happen once if it's unique does it only happen once and if so what does that do to the ability to rely on precedent with future projects that are attempting to satisfy the goal 3 standards through exceptions or other standards for that so i think that's something that we just wish the council to really consider here what will the next facility be able to rely on for precedent and i'm assuming this project will be successfully permitting permitted i believe we'll get our goal three exception because i think we've done an awesome job but i am just concerned and wondering about future applications so there is a difference i think with how the english language uses this word uniqueness and sorry to get wonky on you here and i looked into uh the originalization of this language and how it's evolved how it evolved in the 16th century and it has evolved since the 16th century um todd cornett is a unique human being sarah esterson has the unique ability to to spot flaws in todd's arguments so there's only one todd but sarah's ability to spot flaws in todd's arguments is probably shared by so there is a difference in just calling something unique and saying uniqueness happens only once and then talking more about the unique ability of a project to proceed and to uh to deliver value um to the community and to satisfy climate change goals and objectives so here's the deal in our view the nollen hills project has the unique ability to deploy hybrid clean energy generation resources on a large site that enables the best locations for a solar facility and a wind facility and a battery energy source facility to also enhance agricultural practices and to meet the states and the region's climate goals so that's my elevator pitch on how i think that uniqueness in this setting should be judged and considered you've heard from mr corey this is a legacy multi-generation agricultural operation where site selection for each can minimize and avoid high-value farmland areas the project has selected flat locations with no irrigation rights or solar facility that was deliberate and we were able to use a large site to do that we were able to choose the best locations for the wind energy generation minimizes impacts to natural resources excuse me so what is important about this site is in fact its unique ability to develop a significant renewable energy project while enabling substantial investments in long-standing sustainable and enhanced agricultural practices this project adds a lot of jobs new housing and will provide significant tax revenues for this county and the region and it is based upon those attributes that the dpo does recommend um thank you very much uh does recommend granting the goal three exception and i'll do this so um and we're also also enabling the project to make um some fairly significant investments in climate mitigation so we asked the council to just take in how you're making goal three exception findings so that they aren't so onerous that there potentially could be some compromise in the ability to build additional clean energy projects in the future that's why i wanted to make sure that we had this opportunity to make this presentation and discuss this issue i'm happy to answer questions later on i'm sure mr jenkins will love to take some shots at me on land use issues that's of course par for the so i very much appreciate the ability to speak here this evening thank you later now i know you want to do this hanley all right thank you thank you mr mcmahon um is there anyone else from the applicant that was gonna provide any information today one more sorry matt martin again with with capital power and so we did submit a a comment letter and i just wanted to reiterate for the record i won't go through mr mcmahon's arguments about goal three um the one thing i did want to kind of highlight with everyone as our comments on the decommissioning funding that that's required of the project and we outlined some of the arguments and and we've had kind of a back and forth as over the last couple years um you know no objections to taking down the project in 30 to 35 years it's just the amount that is currently estimated which was done by tetrotec in terms of a decommissioning estimate and you know we believe there's a certain amount of contingency that should be added for odo staff to oversee decommissioning when it comes time and and that's included in our estimate when um you know as part of the back and forth and part of the review there was an additional 10 percent added but um on behalf of uh odo which you know capital powers contingencies in this i think six hundred thousand dollar range uh odos contingency adds an additional over three million dollars um to that and then the best itself has a 20 contingency and again contingency is designed because we don't know what's going to happen in the future but we believe that our estimate which is the the decommissioning costs themselves has a sufficient contingency on top of it and effectively what happened as we went back and forth on this was an additional six almost seven million dollars of contingency was added to our decommissioning estimate um and you know that is going to sit in an lc or a letter of credit over the course of 30 years and adds a lot of cost to the project and we don't necessarily think that it's it you know the arbitrary 10 percent or 20 is is justified we believe you know our experts who are you know well versed in decommissioning that that their amount should stand on their own and so we just wanted to put that into the record we believe that the the amount as presented by capital power which is still in the 30 million dollar range um i think it might have been 32 million range is sufficient but once you add an",

        "text": " but we but we do recognize uh or at least I recognize that that effort is being applied and it and it it's very important that you can continue to do that so we also see that you don't take these responsibilities lightly and for that I'm very appreciative so that was about all I had for today and I wanted to thank everybody for for the time thank you very much Mr Jones um the second one we have is Irene hi Irene Gilbert 2310 Adams Avenue and I also appreciated the discussion about goal three from the council and your review of that and continued concern with making sure you do that right um one thing uh at the last meeting one of the the uh presentators said when do I get to ask questions of the council and I've been thinking about that and I think I think that's a really important issue because really there is no communication back and forth between council members and the public and I think it's a lost opportunity for the council when that does not occur um one thing I can tell you about my own experience during uh a previous actually uh Amendment one there was some discussion about I I made a comment about not feeling that the public had been notified of their rights to uh participate in the in some changes to site certificate conditions and I believe in in my comment I said I it was not my intent to ask for a contested case on that issue but what I did do is send a letter to council asking for some discussion about the issue and that letter didn't get to council before uh it was held up like two months and so I had to make a decision about asking for a contested case on that issue well um so that's what I did and I was denied a contested case so what I The Next Step that I took was to file with the um with the the circuit Corp in in uh Union County because in spite of what the notice to me said about where I filed a an appeal I had done a lot of research into the litigation issue and where appeals go and the limits of what the Oregon Supreme Court hears in terms of fsac issues and um found multiple cases where it said that uh the Oregon Supreme Court that had a narrow Focus which was about whether or not um if you're challenging the approval or denial of the site certificate so anyway I I sent that to the um circuit court and immediately um Oregan Department of energy filed a motion saying it was the wrong jurisdiction so I didn't get my issue heard um and I objected to that I won that and then immediately after that there was an appeal to the Oregon supreme court on the issue of jurisdiction and I'd like to say the issue of jurisdiction has been heard by the court of appeals Oregon Supreme Court Maran County Court Union County court and there there are is some some court cases that go way back several years on this issue so at any rate the next thing was when they were when that was denied there was a motion from uh Oregon Department of energy and the developer to say that my uh issue was moot because the site certificate was now final and I argued that no it isn't moot there's still things that can be done to fix this and so um I just got the result of that hearing and the request to claim that it's moot was denied so so I still have this has been months for me to try to get a hearing on this issue of of a fa notice to the public and where that appeal goes and whether or not there's some uh resolution to it um I don't know what will happen next I know that there is a schedule for my issue to be heard in August now unless the developer or Oregon Department of energy come up with a another motion to do something to avoid having this case heard but I guess what I'm what I'm leading up to here is had the council received my letter timely had the Council had some discussion with me about it was clear to me that council did not understand the true Crux of my concern my concern was that I wanted Council to give me some assurance that when these notices go out telling people what the scope of review is going to be that it accurately reflect and accurately communicate to the public what it is that you're going to make decisions on and and where the public has the right to participate and what I'm saying in in this um appeal is that that didn't happen and that the notice that went to the public said they could only comment on addition of land added to the site certificate when in fact every change in a condition in that site certificate according to the statutes and the decisions um it meant the public could comment on how those changes affected the entire facility so rather than having a discussion with Council and getting some assurance that you were going to look at those an notices and make sure that the public got accurate information now um this issue of jurisdiction is being heard for like the sixth or seventh time um and I still haven't had my case heard and it's silly because it have been resolved with a 20 minute communication back and forth between me and the council so um that's kind of what I wanted to communicate with you is that when you cut back on the opportunities for the public to communicate with you in terms of time frame when there is no um give and take um it's creating contested cases where they don't need to be happening so thank thank you Miss Gilbert is there anyone else in the audience that wishes to testify or provide public comment I don't see anybody so um Nancy is there anybody on the webinar or phone there are no hands raised at this time and no star okay we'll give it just few more 30 seconds or anybody wants to provide public comment I see Wendy King now has her raised okay Miss King okay Wendy your mic is unmuted you can go ahead with your comment okay thank you I just uh been following this I had just have a brief um comment um it has to do with the the contested case that I was denied um Miss king um could you give us your name and address certainly my name is Wendy King my current address is 1337 Southwest p Avenue Redmond Oregon 97756 thank you my my public comment has to do with my um denial of a contested case with the Wheat Ridge East rfa1 and I realized that order final order is completed but I want to back up and just make a mention about the procedure and about um the information that was shared with the committee or the um Council excuse me and that uh when they were deciding about and it appears that there was information given that uh you wanted to be careful not to set a precedence and at this time I think it's appropriate to say that the council may need to rethink that and and determine that maybe this is time to set a precedence and I think that is the goal of these conditions or these um that sometimes a precedence is necessary to protect properties that are being and if you shy away from setting a condition because you may be setting a precedent may not be the right decision and the guidance that's given you may be unduly in favor of the developer and I think that those site standards are in place to protect citizens that's all I have to say thank you thank you Miss King is there anyone else that has their hand up or star3 on the phone that wishes to testify or provide public okay seeing none then uh we'll close the comment uh at U 1133 and um I guess I should check in it's 11:30 uh what does the council want to do as as well we need to do we need to get F we do want to go ahead and jump that now okay so I'm going to move on to um item F which is the Sunstone solar project hearing officer appointment uh secretary cornet uh will cover that one thank you Mr chair uh members of the council for the record Todd Cornett assistant director for sighting and secretary um so if you can move to the next slide please so we are um this agenda item is about the potential for Council to appoint a hearing officer for the Sunstone solar project um just as a way of sort of starting it um every application has mandatory contested case even if there are no parties to a contested case a contested case has to be held um and so for every application the council has to appoint hearing officer at this point we don't have we've not issued the draft proposed order we don't know if anybody's interested in even requesting party status nonetheless we have to you have to appoint a hearing officer and so that's what this agenda item is for so you can see on the screen um a brief overview of the project um and we've talked about it recently it is a solar PV generation facility uh 12200 megawatts on 14.75 square miles of exclusive Farm use on land in Morrow County uh it's south of the city of Borman Sunstone solar LLC is the uh applicant they are a wholly owned subsidiary of pine gate Renewables and where we're at now is that I gave a earlier on today I talked about that um Chris uh and Chase and Nancy held the public information meeting on the application last week in Borman and uh Chris Clark who is the lead analyst is currently working on the dra proposed order next slide please uh and I brought this up the last council meeting so you can see the location of the project so you can see at the top where the city of Boardman is um and then the um blue area with the big border is the project location next please and then there's just a zoomed in picture of that next slide please so uh essentially where we're at is um again appointing a hearing officer and since 2017 Council has utilized uh administrative most agencies are obligated to use them you are exempt however they um do have the skills expertise and Staffing to provide the service and so since 2017 you've elected to appoint administrative law judges for this purpose uh you can see in the last bullet um the projects where that has occurred so Council has appointed hearing officers um for all of those projects next slide please and so um the manager for the Oregon office Administrative Hearings has put forward kriana as the proposed hearing officer for the this project um she has previously been the hearing officer for the Nolan Hills Power project she is Oregon bar certified uh she has done work on numerous",

        "text": " there is underneath the IRA they do provide some Provisions that there's no double dipping across the federal grants for the same upgrades but that doesn't necessarily mean that a single project and so it's for the same project across the grants um you know you could use the grants for two different projects um but it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't a project couldn't utilize for example the homes Grant and a tax credit a federal tax credit for the same project or homes Grant and a local state or utility or other program incentive for the same project it's just the federal grants can be combined for the same project and then obviously not combined through all the incentives over 100 of the project cost um still some to be determined like definitions of disadvantaged communities um and I think we're all still kind of awaiting in general a lot of guidance from the from the usdoe and our other Federal agency partners on on a lot of these funding streams so next slide so the next program under the IRA is the high efficiency electric homes rebate program this one provides in general 4.2 billion dollars uh to States and then an additional 225 um million dollars to to tribes um and similar to the last one Oregon's um it will be allotted about over 50 million dollars of that 4.3 billion um for uh for state-specific use um and then what this one does is it um and this one it provides incentives and grants for various um basically electric equipment and and supportive projects uh to be implemented and this one is income qualified so depending on it's got to be less than 150 percent of the the area median income to qualify for this for this um and there are various rebate caps Associated fourteen thousand dollars um and they kind of range you know up to eight thousand dollars for for a qualifying heat pump and the equipment has to meet certain performance criteria for example energy star levels on heat uh next slide similar to homes this one's distributed through energy offices and energy offices need to submit a plan to the usdoe to be eligible to to receive and utilize the funding and again there's that prevention of double dipping between the Federal grant programs for the same project uh next slide please and then similar to the homes program too states can use up to 20 percent of the grant for planning Administration and technical assistance um and I guess you will notice that that definition of LMI household under the HERO program is a little bit different than under the homes program it's it's at a threshold of 150 percent of the medium income of the area where the homes program was 80 percent so uh next slide oh this slide just gives a little bit more uh detail on you know what what is an eligible entity mean for the purposes of the of the HERO program you know lower moderate income household or an individual or entity that owns a multi-family building we're not less than 50 percent of the residents are low in moderate income households and then also government or commercial non-profit entities that are carrying out projects on behalf of um one of those previously described um qualifying entities and then it kind of lists various qualified electrification projects it includes purchase and installation of um can be part of new construction to replace a non-electric appliance that already exists or for example is the first time purchase with respect to that particular Appliance uh next slide please and then one other area of funding that's separate from the actual grants for project implementation is 200 million dollars to train and educate contractors to to do those projects that would meet a homes or Hera uh incentive so and states can use the funding to either reduce that cost of the training to provide testing and certification or to partner with non-profits to develop and implement the state program uh next slider Roger so separate from like individual project um incentives on the residential side there's also this this big bucket of funding one billion dollars uh in total to provide assistance for the latest and zero building energy codes um one third of that 330 million is to help States get to kind of the the most recent model code level so that's on the residential side the 2021 iecc and on the commercial side ashrae 90.1 2019 um you know things like implementing plans to achieve full compliance with the codes and active training enforcement compliance measurement could all qualify under this um you know for Oregon since we're already at asteroid 90.1 2019 and you know certainly with the 2023 orsc adoption at you know at or beyond the 2021 iecc levels this kind of first bucket of funding um you know in terms of just using that to get to the um you know get to that level of performance probably probably not so applicable but you know certainly potential for training enforcement compliance measurement that could be utilized there but I think the second bucket funding that's that's bigger that's you know double that amount uh two-thirds of this billion dollars 670 um is provided to help help States get kind of beyond the base model codes as they exist right um and start to incorporate the Zero Energy provisions of the 2021 iecc or some equivalent stretch code and then you know similar to the that other first bucket of funding you can use that money for states can use that money for implementing for adopting codes implementing compliance with the codes training enforcement compliance and things like that so certainly a lot of a lot of codes related funding I didn't really talk before about the iija funding but there's a separate 225 million dollars of codes funding um in the um in the iija bucket um that that organs actually actively kind of pursuing a national Statewide um you know National Training potential code training building official training project right now so some certainly a lot of funding coming down the down the way for to assist with code adoption and training uh next slide um the only reason that I think to include this one is just that it doesn't have anything specific to do with buildings or codes or standards but just it's the largest single bucket of funding and it's mostly kind of undefined but it was 27 billion dollars which is you know like I said the largest bucket of funding in the ira so still waiting on a lot of uh Direction on from the uscpa on implementation for this but you know some potential applications for um you know for states to utilize this um potentially for buildings and greenhouse gas reduction in that sector uh next slide so that kind of covers all of the grants that are under the IRA and now I'll just give a brief overview of some of the tax credits and deductions under that uh first one is the 25c non-business energy property efficient home improvement credit that just provides a tax credit for a number of different Energy Efficiency measures so it really kind of expands and extends this this credit as it as it exists and extends it uh through the year 2032. um so you know for qualifying equipment that meets these performance levels these tax credits tax credits will be available for homeowners uh next slide and then in addition to Energy Efficiency projects the IRA also extends um to 2034 the section 25 D credit which allows taxpayers to claim your credit for qualified residential Energy Efficiency property purchases there's a phase-out schedule listed in the in the bill itself and now battery storage with a capacity of at least three kilowatt hours is eligible for this credit too uh next slide so on the commercial side though 179 D credit's been extended and expanded to um it drops that minimum efficiency Improvement down to 25 percent um and lists a base deduction up to 50 cents per square foot uh with potential increases for additional 50 uh additional efficiency up to a dollar per square foot with a bonus deduction of two dollars and fifty cents a square foot if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met up to five bucks a square foot on that um and then it references ashrae 90.1 as its base um kind of efficiency level um and the version that's in effect no later than four years prior to the placed in service state uh next slide and then lastly for the the available tax credits is the 45l new energy efficient Home Credit that's been expanded and and extended and this provides contractors with tax credits for housing units built or remodeled to Energy Efficiency specifications um and then a bonus unit for Mount multi-family bonus credit for multi-family units if the construction meets prevailing wage requirements um so just to kind of highlight some of the performance levels on the single family home side there's there's the two tiers the first one is a 2500 tax credit for meeting the energy star single family new homes program and then double that a five thousand dollar tax credit for meeting the usdoe Zero Energy ready home program that's in effect on January 1st of 2023 so um I haven't been tracking super closely where that one is but Jenny I know January 1st is coming up pretty pretty van close and I'm not sure if the new version of the zrh spec is is out yet some folks on this call might have a better idea than I do um but you know at the same time while Oregon's ad up opting its zrrh equivalency code for the 2023 cycle you know there's obviously some good synergies there where you know a builder um you know just by meeting the code is either at or pretty close to um to that tax credit where it doesn't take a whole lot else to to meet that meet that specification to help support the new code uh next slide um then just a couple quick uh bullet points on some of the other Ira Provisions there's tax credits for manufacturers there's Advanced industrial facilities deployment program and then some additional funding for a variety of programs in rural areas that are that's included with the IRA uh I think that rounds it out Roger uh next slide is there anything else oh yeah never under the biannual Energy report so I'm happy to if there's any questions uh we can take those now any questions from the IRA stuff there's one in the chat there Blake from Kevin oh yeah for the codes finding does each take an equal cut or does that depend on um right now a lot of that's actually still in in flux I think there's still some ambiguity whether or not that's a formula based grant where they just assign you know each state um you know that qualifies that has to you know submit a plan for how they're going to",

        "text": " record yeah that's critical because in your comment your conditions when you're set when you come back to these people in a future meeting said okay this is a plan we're gonna have somebody brings together working that we have a mowing crew in here because the fall and winter when we have the grass growing there is pasture out there but this time of year it's nothing but stubble and that becomes a fire hazard and you've got to control the thing with the mowing thank you so like I've been doing kind of all night I'm going to tie things back to our standards if I can and and one of the questions or points that got made I think ties back to one of our standards so one of our standards is the public services and we're required to evaluate all the potential impacts to Public Services 10 miles out from the facility you go back to that kind of Bullseye Public Services is 10 miles out so we look at the impacts to buy our water sewer police hospitals schools housing 10 miles out from the facility location so if we miss anybody like you know your real Fire Protection District we definitely are making note of that so we'll ensure that we give you notice next time um Colton new schwander and then I think again apologies uh Joanna whitsig a couple more she's wanting to talk one of the main things that you're always bringing up is standards and this is going to sound ornery but it is um I'd be interested to know who wrote the standards was it regular everyday folks that are affected by the step or was it Highly Educated College folks that ain't really affected by all the standards that like I said sounded ornery I don't expect an answer I can respond to if you and another thing that I wanted to say at least on from my perspective we know that you guys ain't the root cause of what's going on so if I get a little irate I ain't mad at you folks but you're the faces of your Corporation or the state and so coming from us you guys are kind of the enemy at this point so you know you get people getting up here getting mad I hope people ain't mad at you personally it's more of what you guys represent and I just want you guys to understand that the other thing I was curious about is where is the power stored is there a way to store it um it's my understanding most of this power just goes to the grid and when the grid it just kind of uses it where it needs it um I've worked in maintenance in power plants one of them being the PKA down in Klamath um I was talking to the guy that runs it down there and the way he described was when like the dams are like a giant battery they can provide Power any old and so the dams just kind of stand on go on standby when the wind picks up because Oregon's all about you know green stuff well what's greener than wind what's greener than Sun so the dams just sit there when the wind picks up well when the wind dies down then then they'll let water come in but when they need to flood the grid with more then a place like Klamath energy which just runs on natural gas fires up and picks up where stuff is a little but how does that play in with sunshine I mean you guys gonna kill the wind out that's already there I mean what I guess why do we need solar panels if we've got the wind if we've got places like Klamath energy if we've got the dams oh well you're taking the dams out so we ain't got them no more uh it it's it's just it doesn't make sense to me if we've already got stuff in I understand you got more power needs it seems foolish to take stuff out especially something like a giant battery that will provide Power when you need it but we gotta Save the Fish so whatever oh I already did that one and then back I think the soil guy left but he rung up some real good points about you know the class one soil and and how it's some of the best ground let somebody do with what they want to do with their ground that's fine it does affect a lot of folks where was the vote you know if something this big it ain't just like they're going to put up a barn or or or you know put up a big eyesore in that sense I mean this affects a lot of folks so should I have been a vote at the very least as to you know who's in support of this and who ain't not so much uh oh by the way they're having a hearing there's lots of ways to get a hold of folks not talking to the city or talking to the council this or talking to that I mean shoot the um we get handouts from all the sorts of different churches our mailbox is full of stuff it's real easy to put postcards in people's mailboxes um saying hey we're we got this we're thinking about doing we got this uh council meeting coming up uh people still read their mail and a lot of folks don't read their email my email is Chuck full of hundreds of junk email don't cut it folks need you know hard copies they can post on their fridge and and okay I got off topic but the class one soil step you ain't telling me okay so you ain't doing concrete you're doing piles the piles I've been around I've watched galvanized six-inch galvanized pipe we drive 80 90 100 feet in the ground to try and reach compactness enough that it can build on and that's just to hold what concrete so okay you take all the concrete out you're still driving a pile probably 20 40 feet in the ground and you ain't be gonna use wood no more so it's going to be a galvanized or something similar pipe that's going to affect groundwater that ain't gonna um you ain't gonna just rip that out of the ground and have your class one soil again 40 years 60 years 30 years how many years the soil ain't never going to be what it was it regardless of how many standards they meet trying to get um trying to match what what the state requirements are it just ain't gonna happen I mean going right back to you take a tree out how long you're going to battle them Roots When you want to I mean you apply across it ply across it Roots come up uh um so I mean you can you can rip all the pile out you want but it's going to affect that soil it ain't never going to be the same and and so that bond that you're talking about is a third party deal okay right but is that that's a state control deal how much of that Bond money is going to come back to the landowner that can't use his ground now because it's like they was saying nuked it's it's toast he ain't gonna grow nothing out there worth nothing so how much is that bond is going to him I don't know these are all questions I don't know we'll ever have the answers to fully but um stuff that people talked about that I don't mind they were talking about to address some of that um this project does have proposed battery storage so uh the project itself you know it would uh it would generate electricity that would be stored into the batteries and so let's just say it's like night time right when there's not a lot of production if not zero um the batteries can be discharged to allow to allow energy back into the grid to continue um to continue producing or uh injecting into the grid as for the mix of electricity that's something that's handled by the utility and that's not necessarily something that we have control of so I apologize for not having uh any information about that Earl Edwards um I just scratched a few facts here real quick looking at Onyx to check out the land base and I've heard a lot of talk about community and several families and some new people to the area and several people that have been here multiple generations and their values and Community Aesthetics and whatnot and so for the local folks here that aren't aware like I said this is just a quick little research I did but what I found out is the proposed acreage for the project area is 1588 Acres and out of that there are 761.89 acres that have a tax address out of Nampa Idaho and then another 76 Acres that have a tax address out of Redmond Oregon which is a total of 837.89 Acres owned by landowners that appear to not be locally present in this community which totals 47 percent of the proposed project area that's all thank you I don't have any more cards no more cards I know there may be some people if anybody else who's in the audience wants to comment please raise your hand and I'll call on you one by okay I know you and then you and then we'll go to that side of the room after that so second yeah my name is Scott Aryan and I'm a landowner just north of this project uh and you're here you're you're supposed to represent and protect the people of Oregon is that correct uh in a way in a way so our process is the think about it is the Environmental review process or or much like uh like a county land use review so we conduct the review we have um you know we're here to make the process work for everybody for the the public the applicant the state agencies local governments tribal governments our process is to run a good process that ultimately holds the applicant accountable to meeting the standards if they can prove that they meet the standards okay you're trying to get in front of future prod problems yes okay uh there's been a little bit of talk about the street corn lark uh it's down to like they're they're arguing how many birds exactly 900 to 1200 birds and there's eight areas left of critical habitat and this area where their product is and then up around Diamond Hill Road is one of the critical one of the eight critical areas you guys mess around on this bird and you folks out here well so so can can I get you to again talk to the microphone uh aware that spotted out and what it did to that industry yeah well you are about out of the gates of hell fall on your shoulder if this bird is listed and you're about that close people talk about a lot of things but once this thing's listed as endangered I'll tell you what happens they walked out with a map they put a big circle",

2024 we're here in the senator hearing room and as always we start with a pledge of allegiance if you'll join us i al to the flag of the United States of America and to the for it stands one nation under God indivisible with liy and justice for all actually it's much more important why we're wearing orange than um recognizing that the Oregon State Beavers are in first place in the Pack 12 baseball tournament or um but I think we're going to do public comment first today before we do uh our Proclamation we have several individuals that signed up for public comment first person is David beam if you want to come up David over to the right side please introduce yourself for the record my name is David beam I'm a spokesman for disability people in County uh the thing is we I was wondering if we can use the Capital Journal for homeless shelter for the wi and any Services after 5:00 so I think we could use that empty lot for the homeless get we can have a showers there for them and we can have U can catch a bus and look for jobs for Maran County and I think it would would work I I working with the mayor the Salem area and Kaiser mayor I'm working with both and try to get this funding for it so I was wondering if we can look at that for the next registrat for funding for this for Capital Journal use that for the Sher cuz women and men could work and take a shower and get a jobs and everything else then they go to emergency we have a backup system there thank you yep and appreciate your work for that because we know that there's some efforts trying to turn it into a community area so I think I think it would will work yeah thank you David yeah I want to will help out and get the funding for it appreciate it thank you thank you have a good day always always a pleasure to see you enjoy your day thank you okay Ivonne Mills come on over to the right here Ivon and just introduce yourself for the please my name is Ivonne Mills can you hear me we can hear you just make sure you keep that microphone closed okay welcome good to have you this is my first meeting I am here to learn I'm not used to public speaking and and I'm absorbing the whole situation here today your support as I'm here in this spot right now is going to be appreciated before we continue on can you just tell us are you a resident of maring County I am a resident of mar County yeah just you you said you introduce your name and maybe your address though would be good oh I live on West Vista in Salem candeleria area perfect thank you yeah um so there's nothing like a mom that gets a fire under her rear end about an issue and mental health is is the issue I want to put a spotlight on I'm looking forward to seeing what this agenda item is about um looking forward to learning so I feel like I'm speaking before I actually I'm kind of going in blind speaking before I've been educated um which agenda item are you the well it's the one about health and human services in which you'll be discussing um funding for crisis kind of but we'll talk about that on the agenda item and then I'll I'll add live at that time okay so if what I want to share applies to that at at this time great if if I'm just kind of like shooting out there in the dark and it lands in your minds as something to remember in the future as you encounter um more funding that could be applied to Services then I hope my story just kind of rests in your minds as well that's what we're here for to listen to your story yeah um so I am the mother of a South Salem High School 18-year-old daughter who could on on one day be playing softball on the softball team on the next next we've got crisis in our home with emergency response coming from police and Mental Services due to her severe schizophrenia this is not a person that knows how to do drugs knows how to be homeless or on fentanyl or prostituting herself yet and I'm afraid because that's where I see much of our individuals that are having mental health issues living it's not a matter it's not a matter of um preference preference to live houseless it's not a matter of addiction these are people that have brain diseases and mental health diseases that affect their ability to make decisions my daughter has the Civil Right to play softball not to be living in eminent Danger from moment to to moment and our family to be living in crisis I'm fortunate to be a business owner I own my own construction company so sometimes while I'm um looking at an estimate for a remodel or a house I'm able to have her there next to me or out sitting in the truck talking to herself the entire time and and not living a full life so if any of these funds that you're going to be discussing or allocating or applying toward different Services have to do with Crisis Intervention I was really sad on an a recent situation when police arrived and Mental Health Services arrived and they said this is our last day that we have funding we're not going to be able to be here for you tomorrow you can talk um I've applied for civil commitment twice I have full Guardianship and not many people achieve that even I have the right to bring her to the hospital and say I'm making decisions in her behalf because she can't make them for herself um but I can't get her from point A to point B without the support of paramedics police and mental health and and those are the people that aren't supported with the funding that they need and also the legal backing that need to help and and to not put the whole you know police force at risk for sued um can I just I just want to normally we don't do this during public comment to have it back and forth but I think what you're saying is is an important topic one I want to say that I appreciate you being brave enough to come here today and to share in the public record your personal story I know I know personally how difficult that is uh I literally just presented the most um emotional testimony of my lifetime in front of the Oregon legislature on uh civil commitment and the need for services in this state a couple things the Oregon Health Authority is responsible for the appropriate funding which they're very bad at um in this system of care that you're describing the um mcrt Team the Maring County response team which is what you described that arrived to your house to help you is something that we value and prioritizing uh to the best of our ability locally but because the orgon health authority chose to make their own internal policy choices in 2023 they're no longer permitting the funding for counties to allow law enforcement to be paid for for that exact team we are navigating currently to try to figure out how to maintain one Salem team we're working with Salem to figure that out and how to keep one Maran County team and we will have four crisis response teams which are only Mental Health Associates responding to those uh opportunities but we all know the reality is is that when you call for help the cops are coming first and then the CRT team who will be in route depending on the safety of the situation engage there we are going to be relentless about this in the pursuit of making sure there is continued funding also you live in a neighborhood right near uh what will be our new Behavioral Health crisis center uh it's kitty corner to uh Roadhouse right next to Birds Unlimited there's a facility that we just bought and we're Remodeling and it'll open next year that is an expansion of our current psychiatric crisis center um this gentleman right here is going to give you my business card with my phone number on it and we're going to connect and I'm going to just sit down with you and walk you through kind of the systems that exist the challenges that exist and invite you to do that work with me yes absolutely into the 2025 legislature um there is a bill to reduce the bar for civil commitment that representative Anderson and representative deal have drafted real life testimony like yours is what's going to make the impact to get the change we need I can't do much to help her when I can't do much to help my daughter when her very own mental illness presents her prevents her she's got Ana synosia very SE very severe it prevents her from being able to receive the help that she needs so I've got a whole ball full of energy that I I want to use to impact change where I can and you know I admit where I'm powerless in some areas but I do want to take some power back in other areas I want to take this one step further too though with funding I want to plug it into your minds is that you know we don't have a lot of facilities like Fair viiew anymore or other facilities and horrific things have happened in those kind of facilities in the past and maybe that's why we've dissipated things into community service and re you know resources and put the burden more so on families so wrap around Services for Families um really could help you I'm so privileged to be able to have my own business and make my own hours and not work when family is in crisis but if I had to get up and go to a 8 to 5 job and show my face every day while she's home alone possibly burning the house down I would have been facing homelessness myself five people in the family can barely take care of the one out of facility so families need support and services if we are going to be the mental health institutions I agree with you thanks for being here thank you it it's I want to Echo commissioner Beth's comments about just the courage to be here and you do have power your voice has power and you're going to get connected with her and she's got a powerful voice too so thank you for being glad to be here appreciate it but I'd like to add is we we need your advocacy not just here but also with our partners in the state legislature and the federal government so this this issue with the um crisis teams and the funding being cut for that we we went back to DC specifically",

reported the incident to us PGE reported the incident to the department within 72 hours this is consistent with condition number 37 of the site certificate uh no injuries were reported and no damage to the wind turbine was reported and it is still operational cause of the Detachment of the nose cone is still under investigation by PGE and then as a reminder the IG low Canyon wind project is 450 megawatts includes 2117 wind turbines and is located in Sherman County so really don't have anything more um at this point because it was fairly recent um incident and then last on my list is uh the July council meeting so that's currently uh placeholder for July 18th and 19th uh we don't know we should know as of early next week whether we're going to need to have a meeting or not so we will contact council members we will check in with um chair how about holding a meeting meeting um but we're not 100% sure but we should be uh by early next week and then we'll reach out to you with that Mr chairman yes um um for the secretary um you had mentioned in the last meeting a possible meeting in clat um do you know what project that would be associated with uh yeah council member delin uh we were thinking that would be the July meeting for the public hearing on the draft proposed order for missed Amendment okay 13 um so that's the missed underground natural gas storage facility um they currently have an amendment which is uh replacing um a lot of equipment and adding some additional equipment so it would be related to that at this point we are not going to be holding the meeting um in clat canai uh draft proposed order won't be ready yet um so I think based upon a couple of things including today's meeting will'll determine whether we need a meeting in July um if we do meting need a meeting in July it would likely either be here in Salem or just virtually um depending upon the agenda items well thank you for that clarification I thought thought it was far too early for any hearings about a proposed transmission line in the Columbia River so uh yeah and that one's not wouldn't be a transmission line it would be um you know yeah it's underground natural gas storage so um yeah numerous components but M Mr secretary I know I know that uh uh I just I was trying to place Clans canai and I just couldn't immediately place it so uh I understand now okay thank you and Sh that concludes my report secretary if I may provide a brief update on litigation yep uh Patrick Ro doj uh update on the appeal of the your the Boardman to Hemingway Amendment one so I will refresh your recollection as I've been doing in recent meetings this was I think probably about 10 months ago now you uh denied a request for contested case on Boardman to Hemingway Amendment one and you approved the amendment Miss Irene Gilbert appealed the denial of the contested case she did not appeal the approval of the amendment she appealed the denial of the contested case to Circuit Court uh so this has been going through a lot of procedural uh machinations since initially my colleagues at doj uh sought to transfer it from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court which has as you know jurisdiction by Statute over your uh decisions on a site certificate the statute does not explicitly address does not address at all uh who has jurisdiction for your decisions on a request for contested case uh the Circuit Court denied that then we went directly to the Supreme Court and asked them to take it up that's probably the last update you got from me the Supreme Court said we're not going to take it up but this council's decision on the site certificate is final uh because M Gilbert had not appealed that aspect of your order so then it went back to the Circuit Court uh and then at Circuit Court most recently Idaho Power as well as my colleagues at doj sought to dismiss it and they said given that the Supreme Court has said that the decision on the site certificate is final this case is moot there's no reason to have a contested case what would we be arguing about the Circuit Court unfortunately denied that motion but did not offer any rationale so right now we're still in circuit court and uh we are uh deciding whether to just stay there and argue whe you know present the case there or once again Ask the Supreme Court to take it up that has yet to be determined what what our next step will be that was interesting thank um yes councelor buyer so is there a statutory fix to the what do we do with appeals of contested cases or do we just wait to see how this shakes out I I have recommended to the department that they go to the legislature and ask for a statutory fix and that's that's up to the department as to whether or not that they'll do that okay thank you it just it seems like this could come up again yeah yeah and we are looking into that question now thank you Council row um so the next item is the wagon trail solar Council",

        "text": "ables program where we have a set of criteria that would describe project Readiness and Technical viability we need technically say on the projects in this where about half the the project weighed and then Community benefits can bring an additional amount of points into these applications in this example and then finally some percentage to help the funds get spread around the states of geographic diversity maybe some technological diversity although we've heard yesterday that that's not as critical in this in the other grant program we were trying to identify projects that weren't solo projects that tend to get all the funding in this one everyone went out and did polls or fuses that would be okay so maybe that's not an important we have a few slides now that look at the criteria that was set up in our other grant program if we want to look at those as an example or we could just log right into a blank page discussion about how we want to set up criteria in this program but the end goal is for us to identify you know features that could be described in an application that will help the best projects rise to the top in our competitive review so that's what we're really aiming for now is creating the selection criteria and awaiting the points for our score lending the process so maybe we'll just put into the room and online if we want to look at some of the criteria that we've got in our other program to plant a seed or if you'd rather just jump into a discussion even when it's fine sure so some of the folks participating virtually would like to see what some of the ideas are so maybe we can walk through those slides okay so we'll go through our criteria table from the C rap program these are not what we're proposing for this program potentially there will be overlap again this is I'm trying to identify renewable energy and microgrid projects so they are inherently different but uh this is kind of the technical liability setup criteria that we have here in that program strength of the project team strength of the project operation plan as well as the project described in the application so that we get a good understanding of exactly what's proposed to be built financial plan looking obviously bringing some share of the funds through these you know the federal funding but there's the match requirements we would like to see how the project Stacks up it is something that can actually be in this program we have statutory limitations to start within 12 and complete within three years when they have a similar criteria that says prove to us that you can complete this at four years to demonstrate this is a viable project in the program so moving on there are some Community attributes in that program that sum up for a total of 10 points and defining competitive review process we have a a competitive review team made up of Auto staff and some external partners that are able to weigh some of these things so again this is focused on renewable energy and energy resilience projects these might not perfectly Translate vocation and communities Community served project leadership maybe outside of the utility how are the utility Our Community Partners brought into the project to ensure that um you know maybe it's the county or the local town to bring them into the discussion to see if there's any additional benefit that can come to a project where the utilities out there doing the work we had a good example of one of those yesterday uh with Communications and power sharing and and so they were able to share the cost it meant the road was closed once it said it twice for each utility to do the thing that sort of thing again in this program we've had a community outreach plan to show how they were engaged Equity framework this might be a way where we could pull in those chess supporting requirements demonstrated with serving disadvantage community's there is a map for that which is in the resource line we may get to that so they would jump to the next batch of criteria yeah we had one question on the external Partners at Odo partners with on the um competitive review of the projects that is yet to be determined for this program okay um I think with this program given that it's going to be technically oriented utility projects that we will seek some expertise for identifying sound technical projects with utilities and if folks have ideas along those lines we we think that it would be hard to recruit utility members because of the conflicted interests obviously you can't just develop so that's a work in progress but it's a good question then we just want to make sure we have the expertise to identify sound projects like we don't know that much about fusing and scada and some of these things that will need to evaluate um so yeah certainly when it comes time to talk about the competitive Review Committee we'll be looking for ideas there as well yeah I think that one other thing on the sea rep that was the for the community renewable energy grant program that was the first time that we sort of did this approach with an external engagement committee helping us to score um and there's also a component on it for environmental justice where we got feedback from our advisory committee and those who are working in that space that you know as a state government entity we may not be best positioned to make determinations on what or what is not environmental justice and so um there's also an ability for the agency to provide some stipends to folks that have more expertise in that space and are under-resourced I think that's been a pretty helpful model we've done one round of CRF Awards already the second round is going to the press release I think coming up in the next day or two um and I think it's been really effective so good experience in that that could be replicated I agree yeah we had one other question uh can projects be started before the application for Grant funds I would like to kick that into Emily she has the answer and like can you speak to that yeah absolutely um I think in this particular instance um it's probably not advisable just given the federal requirements um with Davis bacon and um particularly some of the the other Federal requirements that are going to be necessary um it's it's going to be difficult to comply with those if you've already started a project but we can talk more about that if you had something in mind um connect with Robert myself we'll make sure that our our contact information is available to you guys and I think one of the parts of that part about that a little bit is everyone is experiencing significantly times um in ordering um if something like this happens Across the Nation on the grip grants that are out there uh underground cable is that is sourced nationally Southwire or whoever might end up being is going to end up being getting back to the extension of when you're going to award it and how long you have to do it you know we're looking at Transformers that are two years out just to order Transformers so hopefully it gets better for everybody but it's a consideration out there on the lead times for them for underground water especially it's an interesting notion that the federal grants themselves could create this run-on materials because we've seen the hurricane in Florida that means Transformers are all going to Florida you can't get them here but really with all this Federal money flowing that could be a problem yes they buy American is going to be a significant Exquisite more problems yeah reduce your pool and then the question is is that you know the the conduit that is going in is American cable may not be um some of those thank you yeah we had so Thomas also had another question so do you like I like the idea that we mentioned early with looking at the utility itself to meet any underserved requirements but if we hold it to only the justice 40 rules it could be tough to get more comprehensive projects done and Thomas would you like um I guess speak to this uh personally or weigh in with any additional thoughts on that thank you yeah actually uh I mean this is this is this is actually part of the reason why why we got rejected the first time around on the on the kind of just the general Federal side was was uh because our projects some of our projects kind of fell into the Jester's 40 area but like it was maybe more like a a 70 30. so you know 30 of the project was was Injustice 40 and then the other 70 was falling outside of that and and we CA and we couldn't just piecemeal it as just like that 30 it was it was like you know a whole you know say a say a substation you know feeder upgrade or something like that I I don't know I'm I'm just throwing it out there but that but this is this is kind of something that that we were running into uh so we'd love to again I know it's been talked about with the kind of expanding the the underserved Community requirements and what that looks like um so I I fully encourage or I guess I fully endorse that that idea that I and I encourage it to kind of see beyond just the justice 40 because there's a lot more uh yeah what underserved means uh Beyond just the justice 40 in our service areas uh there's there's a lot of rural disadvantaged communities that that were that were serving that just may not be identified on that map yeah thanks Thomas um we have proposed flexibility in our application to usdoe and we are awaiting their response to what we had proposed but we would like the ability to go beyond the lives of the map and take Community input as one of our ways to you know determine these disadvantaged communities so I think that fearing your experience with federal dollars at eweb actually makes me give me some concern that maybe they won't give us the flexibility we ask for but we'll see and that's one of those things we just have to wait for the usdoes response to our narrative to see how flexible we can be there yeah thank you Thomas and I know that we have someone on the phone who had a hand raise I wonder if he could bring them off mute can you hear me folks yes we can hi perfect perfect um hey this is Rohit Nair from Pacific Corp just had a great conversation uh appreciate the discussion just had a quick question regarding um buy America requirements um the Pacific Corp has made some you know group applications but as part of the uh proposal as part of the iij and the statute itself um uh for Prospect we can ask for an exemption and re-exempt it for from buy America but that might not necessarily be",

        "text": " your Chief equity and inclusion officer for Washington County and I just wanted to start by saying thank you for your um and an appreciation that the reason why I'm here today talking to you about the budget Equity tool is because of budget committee Direction in 2021 um I also want to appreciate staff in the office of equity inclusion and Community engagement and across the county for taking on the challenge to launch this relatively new process so we start by asking why Equity why is it important to consider equity in public budgeting our budget is significant policy which you adopt or the board adopts every year in alignment with the County's Equity resolution the board has committed to providing leadership to make Washington County more Equitable and inclusive to all marginalized groups and spending the Public's dollars in a way that maximizes the benefit for the entire County Washington county is one of the most diverse counties in Oregon both in terms of race and ethnicity as well as language one out of three Washington County residents identifies as a race or ethnicity other than white and approximately 93 000 Washington County residents speak a language other than English at home so while we're not the most diverse we are among the most linguistically racially ethnically diverse counties in Oregon additionally there is a significant income gap and so we know that there are inequities that cut across the various aspects of Washington County Business one in ten Alaska Native American Indian households and one in ten black African-American households have incomes less than fifteen thousand dollars a year which is twice the Washington County average across all Races so when we're thinking about Equity we're thinking about data informed decision making so really looking at understanding where the inequities actually exist by looking at our data being transparent about our deliberations and our decision making as well as engaging the community we are looking at equity in Access quality and outcomes and so who has access to Washington County Services how are those Services meeting the unique cultural norms value values and social positioning of our diverse communities and how our our investments transforming the environments that create and sustain inequities as well as what is the result of our investments how do we know we are actually moving towards equity in the outcomes that we are investing in next slide please okay so this is the second year that we have done the budget Equity tool and the tool has evolved between year one and year two based on the feedback of staff um initially we focused on the areas of civil rights data Community engagement quality of services and targeted resources for all organization units that had budget that include personnel and based on the feedback of Staff we modified that so that we have two budget Equity tools one for Community facing organizational units and one for internally facing organizational units so internally facing organizational units are those organizational units that don't have direct contact with the and they can be um within departments or their own the tool that is the most comprehensive is for the community facing organizational unit it focuses again on civil rights data understanding where the inequities are Community engagement and budget development Equitable Services including culturally specific Service delivery and Equitable organizational development which includes how do we focus on building a Washington County Workforce that's reflective of our community as well as understands truly what Equity diversity and inclusion means in their day-to-day next slide please so in terms of some of the initial results of the budget Equity tool we did include some of the numbers of the proposed departmental requested Equity this reflects base budget amounts prior to developing the four seven and ten percent cut scenarios that all departments were asked to make um so we saw a range of departmental budget strategies related to equity including some departments that propose no cuts to equity Investments those that proposed cut scenarios on our proposed cuts on par with the cut scenarios and some that proposed cuts to equity Investments at a higher proportion than the cut scenarios requested in terms of equity focused Service delivery Investments the base budget represents just shy of five million dollars for culturally specific Service delivery and that's about 77 percent decrease from last fiscal year primarily due to changes in arpa allocations the community engagement amount is the first time that we actually looked at it this year so we don't have a comparison to what was spent on community engagement last year but it's slightly over three million dollars being proposed this year which is really exciting and in terms of Equitable organizational development Investments the base budget amount of slightly less than half a million dollars represents about a sixty percent decrease from last fiscal year and the Civil Rights Investments oh sorry Equitable organizational development just shy of two billion dollars represents about a 43 cut from last year and then the Civil Rights or interpretation translation accommodation investments just shy of half a million dollars is about a 61 decrease from last um the bright note um for our Equity Investments is the increase of about eight percent in the number of bilingual staff who are occupying bilingual required positions so that increased to 194 full-time equivalent staff and the good news on top of that is that we also have bilingual staff in bilingual preferred positions so this is a strategy that helps us meet the needs of a very linguistically diverse Washington County so again these data points the difference between last fiscal year this fiscal year does not make a trend and we did start the budget Equity tool during the covid pandemic and so some significant shifts in Investments are reflected due to our spike in federal Investments to respond and then recover from covid that's all for now unless you have any thank you very much do we have any questions check online too oh yeah anyone online have any questions okay hearing none thank you very much for your presentation chair Beach one point just a reminder to the budget committee members to turn make sure your mics are on you should have a green light that shows if it's not there's a button right in the front center that'll turn on turn the mic on for you now I think we can move on to our presentation from Lut uh Mr Roberts and I'm gonna Miss and Sheila Mrs giobrony is that correct okay good evening committee members and um Commissioners glad to be here with you tonight and for the record I'm Stephen Roberts I'm the land use and transportation department director Camilla jambroney I am the administrative services manager for the all right we'll walk you through the most exciting budget presentation you're going to see in the next hour and for those uh anyone who's interested I just wanted to point out that the north Bethany County Service District for roads budget uh information is found on pages 307 and 308 in your budgets a Marie book and then there's also a paragraph in the trends and initiatives section related to The District on page 32 in the budget thank you and um got to get my get my tech in order okay so just a quick overview about the district so the district actually covers the north Bethany sub-area in our Bethany Community Plan and this sub area was planned as a discrete area back in their mid-2000s early 2010s as the north Bethany area largely was brought into the urban growth boundary in 2006. the district itself is a property tax district and it levies a rate of 1.25 cents per thousand of assessed value on properties within the district and it's used to fund certain Transportation improvements that are within and adjacent to the north Bethany Community there is a project list that was adopted as a part of the board adopted North Bethany transportation funding strategy which was approved in 2011. as I mentioned this was adopted in conjunction with the community planning process for North Bethany there is a list of 14 potential Road improvements and 12 of those improvements are eligible for Public Funding in the north Bethany transportation funding strategy when the community was being planned there was an assumption that it would likely take about 20 years to build out the community and the plan was for these revenues through these various funding sources that I'll touch on to accrue over time and the funding sources that are part of that funding strategy include What's called the transportation development tax that's a county-wide charge implemented as a tax but it is essentially also a system development and that's essentially a fee that developers pay and it's designed to help offset costs for infrastructure improvements that are needed to support in the north Bethany Community part of the funding strategy included a supplemental transportation system development charge specific to this area and just very quickly before we moved on I just wanted to give you just a sense of magnitude so that the transportation development tax as of July 1 will be about ten thousand six hundred dollars per single single dwelling and the north Bethany system development charge the supplemental charge will be just under eight thousand dollars per single unit single single detached there's also some funding that was committed from the County's major streets Transportation Improvement program mstip that is a county-wide portion of your property tax revenues that have been allocated by the board to transportation we also have what we call trust and agency funds those are typically payments from developers who for some reason are unable to complete a infrastructure Improvement that is a legitimate requirement for their development and if for some reason they just physically can't build it we'll take money in lieu of the construction and then use that funding in the future perhaps for a publicly constructed project or perhaps constructed by even another developer and then the last charge or the last funding source and the reason that we're here tonight is the north Bethany County Service District for roads property tax and as I mentioned that is the 1.25 cents per thousand dollars of assessed so where are we now with the community build out so I mentioned it was going to take we thought about 20 years to build out due to a variety of timing circumstances we were finishing the planning for this community just as we came out of the Great Recession there was a lot of pent-up demand for single-family housing and newer apartments and housing units so the community really was able to take off very quickly we finalized the community plan in 2012 and then development really began in 2013 and 2014. and about nine years in to an assumed 20-year build out we've already permitted about 72 percent of the total units that we expect to be developed in that area and the first number that you see there the 93 that's actually units that have their land use entitlements so typically you need a land use entitlement and then later you obtain building permits so the first number",

        "text": " a attachment to to the staff report for this agenda item and also were uploaded to the public comment sighting the sighting public comment docket or public comment portal everything is online there based on the Department's review of information on the record of the amendment request including the public comments received on the record of the DP the standard listed on this slide uh the department does not identify any additional substantive changes or recommend amended or new conditions um following the the close of the commment period but now the next six slides approximately are standards where comments or issues were applicable to the standard so I'm going to go through that comment by comment standard by uh next slide please the department received a comment from the certificate holder um this was a a comment to reflect the current language of condition 27 or the the certificate holder comment indicated that the language in the DPO on condition 27 was not the same as what was represented in the uh draft site certificate Redline site certificate and so they requested that the language from the redline site certificate be reflected in the DPO and the department sees this as a minor correction and recommends that the language in the DPO uh be amended to reflect that was presented in the redline site certificate next slide please the next comment I wanted to touch on and I seek council's um clarification or instruction was um a comment received during the public hearing last month by council member and the comment was or there was a request made that the department make sure that the information provided for the wildfire and organizational expertise standards be consistent with recent Council decisions um and so that's why these two standards are up here but with that um I would do is there do you have any additional specifics that you'd like to see council member buer sure I think in one of the recent certificates that we issued and help me councelor Condon if I am wrong we made it explicit that the organizational expertise would be evaluated um both for contractors and subcontractors down to Construction operation I think we made more specific findings there um I can't remember which discussion this was under it may not be applicable since we are talking about a repowering as opposed to a new certificate but we were pretty explicit that we wanted that expertise at each stage of construction and operation I think um and again this might not be appropriate for the repowering since we have experience with this particular developer but we had required a letter of something to demonstrate that the parent company had the back of the LLC and again may not be appropriate in this case but um I'll look to staff to to just pull those comments up and see if they apply here again if if you're comfortable that they don't we will we will rely on your your discretion but we have made those conditions a little more specific and on Wildfire you just listen to our discussion on Wildfire so um trying to be consistent in our conditions there and and particularly the requirement to coordinate with the local emergency managers because they're kind of the ones who are responsible ultimately thank you and this is secretary esterson um I just wanted to offer in response to your comments about looking back to Prior decisions for consistency related to the Wildfire mitigation plan that we did have the opportunity to look at the obsidian project where there was a good discussion and direction to staff to corporate a requirement that as part of the coordination by the certificate holder with emergency response providers that there be a plan for how those service providers could notify surrounding land owners so that again was a direction from the obsidian Wildfire mitigation plan that we're going to assume to apply to both every as we've been talking as we learn things that don't seem to be site specific they should apply to every work in an overtime create create a template Baseline for all wmps um for both construction and operation this is an element that will be included thank you that was that was exactly it and and again on the organizational expertise um that's another one that's evolving so things that we can put into place to protect both the public and and the developer um but but again we're working with a project that's ongoing so it may not be appropriate but thanks for modifications Vice chair Condon uh thank um uh Cindy cond for the record and I apologize for having step away for a bit um but just jumping off of counselor byer's uh comment um I do think it's important to look back um especially at the organizational expertise uh standard now that we've got the Wildfire uh standard many of the projects are llc's with limited liability back to the parent company and what is in place should Wildfire now happen even though the risk is low what is the public safety uh provision that um has someone responsible other than the property owner whose uh property has been devastated or or impacted negatively impacted and to me um that liability piece ties to the organizational standard so it might be due to Wildfire but the organizational expertise standard uh plays in that about the work we do to establish there's some accountability so or responsibility I should say thank you thank you next slide please uh uh for retirement and financial Assurance we received uh a comment from the certificate holder that requested clarification in the findings as it relates to condition condition 122 and amended condition 30 to understand the frequency and discretion for Odo and Council to make adjustments as appropriate and necessary to the contingencies of the bond or letter of credit uh the certificate holder also provided or proposed uh amended condition language in their comments on the next slide Nancy I have the condition language uh that's as represented in the DPO but with my proposed change and I'll talk through my proposed change and the department included that language appropriate necessary in conditions 122 and the our recommended amended condition 30 as it relates to the protection of public health and safety and the environment due to Future uncertainties such as increased labor rates equipment rental uh waste man tipping fees at Waste Management facilities Etc and to also reserve the right of both the council and the department um um to adjust contingencies the department recommends that for both conditions um removing appropriate and is appropriate but leaving uh necessary because um leaving necessary the word necessary would would maintain and reserve the right to adjust contingencies um the appropriate word uh is sub is a subjective threshold and I think we can get rid of that but to to reserve our right or the council's right to adjust I think we should keep necessary um but get rid of appropriate and um do you have any discussion questions on on that proposed change Vice chair Condon um thank you um I just have a question about necessary it seems to me that necessary might be as subjective as appropriate I mean is it necessary what defines necessary is it council's belief that it's necessary or is it based on some evidence that we can go back to and say it's supported by this uh this information this data this is secretary cornette um the way that we're envisioning this addition to work is that we as the department and our compliance program would be evaluating their annual report which would provide evidence of whether they're complying with this is more for operational really but um whether they're providing evidence that they're keeping that site um clean right I mean are they reporting spills all the time fires all the time well that bond that is based on really a perfectly operated facility is no longer adequate um to restore the co the site and adequate to maintain so I think the ne necessary to me is connected to our ongoing compliance evaluation and appropriate just added confusion and so it strikes me that there then would be evidence to justify I mean documented evidence to support the necessary okay you next slide please Nancy uh for fish and wildlife there were two comments made by the certificate holder that I thought were applicable to this standard the first was a um was a comment on how the certificate holder evaluated approximate or potential temporary disturbance within the repower corridors the certificate holder requested that um there the well the certificate holder that the temporary disturbance areas per facility component in the amendment request uh were an estimated approximate total um in that these estimates were based on preliminary designs and do not leave room for any changes that may occur prior to construction or allow flexibility out in the field um therefore the certificate holder requested that uh these totals proximate temporary disturbance totals a like an approximate limit um or not exceed 10% of the approximated disturbance to which the department does not recommend um changing anything to the maximum temporary disturbance quantities or establishing a 10% flexibility flex flexible threshold um allowing for flexibility in disturbance quantities of up to 10% um first it wasn't what was represented in the amendment request but it also could result in impacts not previously evaluated so I think we would just not allow for a 10% flexibility the second comment uh was a minor correction uh specify in a table within the DPO it's table two I believe there's a table where we've uh summarized comments received on the preliminary request for Amendment and in that table the certificate holder uh commented the summary of the ODFW comment um and the mitigation ratio in that summary was incorrect um and so the department in the DPO recom or in the proposed order recommends that uh it be Tred up to uh a habitat mitigation ratio uh consistent with OD FWS guidance so it just was a a a a misrepresentation of the ratio it was in the table we said Category 2 habitat impact ratio of 1: one not a 2: one which would be ODFW guidance we'd recommend increasing it to two to one um and that's the change proposed there next slide please um lastly this is uh I'm seeking clarification from um a comment made by council member Imes and the comment received was um you requested that the department review condition 130 and provide more information in detail to support the waste management plan it's and its requirements um and I guess we interpret the outcome of this condition condition 130 to result in uh contracts and agreements or a plan uh that would include a description of methods um for methods and vendors for the packaging transport and recycling of wind turbine components is there any like other additional information or clarification you would like to provide on this topic how councelor hes thank you um I reviewed this section um and I didn't see any changes after the public comment period so again it's I'm under the um what's on the record and that is that there was a plan originally for Waste minimization",

        "text": " most cities have to do it too. I just wanted to talk about how I see that everyone here is very passionate about the subject and obviously it is also of personal interest to you because many of these people are going to be affected by this and those who are going to implement it are here, I think we should take this into account for me as well, that is, speaking on a personal basis, we are talking about different taxes I would be in favor of one and against others I do not feel that they are connected even then for me because it is a difficult vote and of course I would be affected by both taxes I am more in favor of one than the other he mentions a point very important is that a tax on a business I think it is important to keep in mind that that is what they both are although one is called by license the payment of a license you are not going to harm you are not harming Walmart to Home Depot to that type of corporate or large companies you are harming small businesses that are here in the community you are talking about those small businesses that donate to those that are non- profit those that help those most in need Those These are the businesses that harm other businesses because when you make a corporate tax it is already included and the cushion there is that if the business is worth more than 10 million dollars you have to pay a tax. So I tell you that it is not difficult to have a difficult one. One that makes a million dollars is not difficult, it is very difficult, it is that if you make 10, it is very difficult to operate a business. The businesses in this community cannot even support the community. Okay, That's why we can make one, two teams. It's real it's in the community This is a community that is improving and here we have businesses that are willing to pay the fee this has to support the businesses with 10 20 it's not going to affect the people who think it's going to affect it's going to hurting everyone they're doing you have small businesses here so I want to say as a business owner we're going to be hurting those small businesses Okay I talked to Bill briefly in the break I understand where he's coming from and this idea of \u200b\u200btaxing Walmarts and what? and that this is about paying what they get as maybe taxes should be imposed on those who are not doing these initiatives but I am not going to impose taxes on those who are supporting the community. I do not want to get rid of those measures. not because I know how to use it, but maybe we would need it, I don't want to get rid of them, keeping them on the list does not mean that they will be in the very grateful or appreciate the feeling and concerns when I wrote it together with the staff. It's been a long time, I'm not going to say. How long ago, like a few decades ago, when we made this license tax, it was gradual and even those who have this, those who rent offices pay one license a year and as a business, I appreciate the advice. schoolchildren, whatever their preferred foundation, I believe that the community also has to be supported. My comment, seeing the 50% approval is very easy for people to see other people's money for fiscal purposes and for me these two stand out In that sense you will be able to realize that whenever there is low support it has to do with taking money out of our pockets. So I do believe that when we see this holistically we are trying to see them and we have to consider the Source of information is my comment I support keeping them in the list simply and according to the agree with Vick's point is that maybe they need in the term there are many high profile because every good tax that is chosen is someone else's favorite tax which gives people a wish of imposing these corporate taxes is that since they are normally directed at General etc., I think it is very difficult to achieve a corporate tax equitably because the margins are very different that you can harm one business and it does not affect the other and this is due to the uncertainties and all the varieties that exist that can make it very difficult to evaluate the incidents themselves as part of a tax comment more last comment to vote comment and then I present the motion because it is already 857 I was wondering if the person who made the motion would like to divide the motion to vote for each of them separately I think that would be worth it because the corporate tax takes two to 5 years to implement so it's not even going to be fixed in the short term So it's different fundamentally different from the first one so I would like to vote In those about those two separately I would agree with that yes okay we call it the motion on the first one and that is the license the license payment as a business yes it is a buto to eliminate the license of the businesses all in favor of those who are in favor of removing the license for not earn after the corporate income tax say in favor those oppose say in favor Okay thanks for that discussion at this point they still have 12 high interest options so they have several on this list we are going to withhold business licenses corporate income and also from negative to positive the increase in fees for services of the urban renewal agency tot tax on vacant buildings and special district formation So my question for this group of that list of 12, which is still quite long to discuss whether the objective is that in the next meeting they are going to talk about the options and it is an open question for the group. Do they plan to have further discussion about eliminating any of these points or going to discuss in the meeting Okay I would like us to have a subgroup and talk about some that are appropriate for the short term to see if we can match them or recommend keeping them Maybe one point about that idea is that we have two weeks Between now and tomorrow next meeting so I'm seeing a time restriction there is potential Okay can I ask if of the options that remain that the working group I don't know maybe group them by time because it seems to me that there is a certain consensus on some type of short-term recommendation And unlike the long-term ones, it can be one final product or two separate final products. And try to separate it and break it down as much as possible. Adams I would like to do that for us as a summary and they also beat us because it is the intention of following. meeting we are going to structure it with short and long term options fantastic and Okay then Steven Jenkins I wanted to know if in another survey and how positive and negative we can classify there are 12 options from 1 to 12 and we need a sense of where we focus the energy and I would like to know with the group in favor of also breaking it down into two short-term and long- term options and get feedback on these points in that case I would also say that there is an area that we do not go into in the conversation tonight if you are Potential long term options can be added to the survey as well To support the conversation but there are six additional potential areas that need to be discussed in the next group and I just wanted to highlight that I have a question Bill Simon I have a question about the tax rate of local property we could want to continue with the meeting we have to make a motion to continue with the meeting second the motion everyone in favor in favor someone opposes then the meeting is going to end at 10 and we often uh we are going to have those taxes uh for service And then I guess it's possible to go ahead with a uh rate to fund the general fund I think that 's right they ran uh Josh the The Gap in the background And then it's possible that we look at the local option cup to take a look at it look at where we are in compression in parts of the city what I understand is that Salem is not in compression and the southern part of Salem is in compression and I don't understand the specific point that discussion came up last time and I saw that there are more details about the characteristics the assets are going to be on the marion county side I don't know if there are more questions or more discussion and if we can't 9:1 and the session is already closed at an",

        "text": " Oaks manor. He's riding Marion Oaks Boulevard. And of course, Marion Oaks Lane. And those, most of those of county roads, which means you guys have to repair them. Okay. The biggest one that we're stuck with in Marion Oaks is 100 6560 5th Lane Road. And then I just found out 133rd street. That'll fall upon our community to make sure that we fix them up. And I don't want to do that unless they're willing to pay for the fixing of those roads. As far as your county roads, I don't want you guys wasting a penny. You need to make sure that you're protected, too. Mister Munoz, again, can you give us those road numbers again that you're concerned about? 165th Lane, road, lane, road. And then he just mentioned 130, 3rd 160. That's where I was getting a little tripped up. Okay. Mister Munoz, I can guarantee you that if they get an approval today, they will have to take care of that road. Thank you all the. Don't forget the other roads. They're going to be traveling on those too. Your roads. Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to speak to this item? I'll invite you forward. And again, if you'll just give your name and address for the record, please. And if we could have the map come up as people are talking, where they relate to that property. Yes, thank you. Florence Charbonneau. 15 114 Southwest 49th Court, Marion Oaks, Ocala, Florida 34473. My concern obviously is the residents. What Mister Tillman does not know is that there have been several real estate agents that have come into the area and looked at that particular area for building, and they want to build larger homes on that area. Some of those properties are quite large and will hold those substantial higher end homes. Also adjacent to this, the neighborhood children have developed an atv course that borders that property goes out into the wildlife area. I want to make sure that they're protected from those trucks coming in and out. School's out. The kids are going to be out. They're going to be out on that road. And the last thing is the care of the roads. We as taxpayers pay for that with the MST. So I just want to make the commissioners aware of those things that are going on in marion Oaks. And as these people move into the area, that area is going to be developed more and more. So I thank you. Thank you. I think I had another gentleman. Yes, and is there anyone else? If so, I'll invite you to come forward behind this gentleman. Coming now. Matt Winters, 12850 southeast Fifth Ave. Matt Winters. And what was the address? 12850 Southeast Fifth Ave. Okay, thank you. Gotcha. Ocala. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. So I've been doing land clearing for about seven years now. So I'll give you a little bit what's going on in the land clearing world. We are flat out running out of places to take this stuff. So the very few places that do take it, they grind it, they turn it into mulch. They haul it off. So the many trucks that we are taking in to these dump sites, turning it into mulch, well, then it's being trucked out again to the places that take the mulch, which is Gru, I believe, is one place that takes it and uses it for energy. These places shut down on occasion as well. So that backs up the mulch. So now we've got piles of mulch and piles of debris from many lots that are being cleared on these. On these dump sites. So with the two or three dump sites that there are in the county, which are essentially 35 to 45 minutes away, to truck it all the way up in town, they're all full, calling us, telling us that they're shut down, they're too tight. They can't take us in there. So there are other options on other side of town, which is probably, again, further away, if you're far enough back in Marion Oaks there. But there are simply. There's nowhere to take it. We have to run it out of town or out of the county. There's just nowhere to go. In fact, half the time, you get halfway to a job or halfway to the dump site, they can call you and tell you, hey, we don't have any room, so they'll shut you down. That's like being told you can't go to work. So. And if not on these roads in Marion Oaks, which the trucks are already on there, grabbing the debris and taking it in and out all day, the concrete block trucks that are in there for the houses, the cranes that are in there, hanging trusses, those. That's the same thing. So if not there, we're just running across the county on the same roads. So my time's up. Thank you, mister, before you step away, commissioner curry? Yeah. Are the trucks all dump truck types? Dump trucks, grapple trucks. Well, what size trucks are they? Grapple truck is. What size? What do you mean? 50? They hold about 50 to 60 yards of debris. And most of our trucks have trailers, are pulling trailers about 100 yards, like a storm truck. Seen a storm truck, the grapple, and sitting on the back and got 40, 50 yard pup trailer and a truck in front, you know, the one that we had out here for the day, the 50 yarder grapple truck. With the no horsing around Marion litter logo on it at the back of it. That's, that's the size truck they're running? Yes, right around there. Yes, sir. And the trucks that haul the haul the mulch from the sites are hundred yard trucks as well. Well, I did get an answer from Mister Tillman. I think he said 100 trips a day or something. But how many trucks are involved in transporting the material? So I would say right now there's probably around 20 to 30 trucks that pull trailers. So you're talking a 50 yard truck and a 50 yard trailer or a 60 yard truck, a 60 yard trailer, something like that. So. And they're active every day. Every day we're going hauling debris. Our land is being cleared and got to go somewhere. Yeah. Hey, thank you. Mister Winters, is there anyone else in the audience that would like to speak on this item? See, none. Mister Tillman, can you speak on behalf of the owner? Again, roads being the issue on 165th Lane Road as well as 163rd street, we said we would do the maintenance. The other thing I'd like to point out is a lot of times you all have people come in front of you that don't have any ownership in the MSTU process. We actually own, it's either seven or nine lots here that pay into the MSTU. So they are paying into the MSTU system as well. But we recognize that those immediate roads that are coming directly off of the county roads into here, they are. Those are going to become our responsibility for maintenance. We recognize that. Where are those lots owned? I do remember that being noted as well. I just asked the owner how many owned. I did not ask the exact location, but they're in Marion Oaks and participating in the MSDU. Okay, so not everybody pays in, but this is one owner that does. And there's a lot of locations around here for people to develop, lots in this region that haven't been developed adjacent to this. It's not because this is here, it's because there's nothing else. And I would say when it comes to illegal writing, the best way to protect people that are riding illegally is to stop the illegal writing, not try to create some protection from our trucks. I mean, that doesn't make sense. They're riding illegally. Stop the illegal writing in the neighborhood. Well, I do know that that has been an issue on the property that we own there as well. We have some stormwater property that's set aside or a dra something. And I do that happens in a lot of your dras across the county, actually, that is the problem. And I'll also point out that having something like this in the region helps prevent illegal dumping. You talked about trash day and litter, the littering and having the trucks here. There's illegal dumping that occurs right now. If you close the site down, it will get worse. We know that if there's not a place for people to go, they'll just, they'll find a corner somewhere and dump it out in your public right of way or on somebody else's private lot. And so, I mean, there's an extreme need. I wish I had as many people come out and speak as we did at the PNZ hearing. It's just, it's harder to make this meeting the other ones after work. So this one being during the day makes it more difficult to have people attend. But if you go back and look at the record, you will see that there are many, many people did get up and say that this is, this is a necessity, I believe. Commissioner Curry? Yeah, two quick in terms of the being responsible for the road maintenance, what do you post a bond? How do you secure that? We could, I mean, we could post a bond or do a letter of credit or an escrow. One of the three. And then future growth on that site. Right now you have how many incinerators? Three. We have, yes, I believe we have three. And then the location to the south was the,",

        "text": " know what your sheep choose on a wire right so um often those will be um those are often figured out in those contracts and uh if you're talking about like trying to grow plants under panels often we're working uh you know with farmers who own that land and are leasing it to us so often it will be the landowner um who would be the one doing that although i'd say agrovoltaics in the sense of growing crops under panels is still very hard to do and do an economic scale right now at least to my knowledge of it i i will drop in the chat i previously worked at uh on a report about our dual use and agribolt takes uh in oregon and washington and i'll put that report in there and it talks about these kind of specific issues all right and angela and john there's a question for john in the chat from angela so when we go into breakouts john if you want to if you want to answer that that'd be great and john i wouldn't be able to see my chat but i'll do my okay thank you i'm sorry we're just so far behind and i really want to be respectful of people's time and make sure that we can move on to getting getting to the agenda but i know this is an important conversation for you all to have so i promise if we are doing well on the agenda we can circle right back to having this conversation um i'll be hopeful we'll make up the time um so let's move on to the breakouts if that yeah yep and um john i thought that point about you know trying to open up opportunities for ag on existing projects in in ag country is that's an interesting question and getting at those lease agreements is a an interesting part of the barrier there so um thanks for for chiming in and really the issues around this topic as well as all of the other topics we've heard about are ones that we can kick right into our breakout sessions so i'm going to kick this slide forward so what we want to do in the breakout you all will be randomly assigned to breakout rooms i think we'll have five breakout rooms and we really want to get at the top three barriers and top three that our work group members and and other participants in the meeting today would like to see in the report so these are things that we really should focus on highlighting and so take take all of these issues into these breakout groups and and turn them into specific recommendations so um with that said i think that will be our kickoff for rit team to start breaking us into groups each group should have an odo team member there to take notes but within the group we're hoping that you can kind of choose a non-odo staff member to be a um a champion of the of the discussion and to bring some talking points back after the breakout sessions with that said let's break out into these groups and we originally planned for 20 minutes we might trim that a little bit since we're running behind schedule and i hope to see you all after the breakouts with some great great and diane we'll try our best with getting the phone getting you on the phone and into the breakouts but um linda will work on it but just give us some time to figure that out thanks for that hi all can you hear me okay so thanks for introducing yourself in the chat mark jessica and tom and i think maggie and diane can introduce yourselves in the chat um so does anybody want to go first let's start a little round table here in the freak out on what your thoughts are on the top three barriers and top three opportunities that we should be thinking about highlighting in the report 90's here i i think um across the board we need to highlight the interconnection a really small scale like two megawatt facility down here we have a lot of landfill spaces uh five-facing perfect store for those we've uh we've already got the feasibility studies but the voice cost is way too low so we're um it just doesn't have a lot not only how would i get other than grants or or outside funding we're back it was similar in other breakout rooms the time limit interrupted a productive discussion but that's kind of the way of breakout rooms so hopefully we got there anyway so um thanks everybody for joining in the um i think now what we want to do is try to boil boil down these takeaways and just discuss kind of a roundup of what happened in these breakouts so is there a volunteer from group 1 to share takeaways yes uh rob i will be doing that um so i can go through we had in my group uh in addition to myself we had representative owens mike mcarthur brooke brownlee and joshua bossaven from climate solutions uh so top three opportunities uh we didn't really settle on the top three we talked about a lot of things so i'll just try to cherry pick here the top three and i'll lean towards some of the more innovative interesting ones that i thought so representative owens in particular had an interesting one around um small-scale renewables using less water potentially on um some ag land compared to what's happening today so maybe some opportunities in the future to look at um moving some of those water rights into conservation at the same time that you can develop some renewable projects so that was an interesting opportunity that i had not heard discussed too much um other two i highlighted here were opportunity for local ownership with small-scale projects maybe compared to larger projects and then uh opportunities for resilience being significant so those were the that came to the top of the list from our group uh in terms of top three barriers uh we had a discussion about um sort of the value of storage but there being a barrier around how to compensate small-scale projects that want to co-locate storage with their project nimby issues and sighting issues were identified as another barrier and again an interesting suggestion there around potentially looking at creating some kind of land used overlays and maybe we could kind of streamline uh kind of go versus no-go zones for for citing small-scale renewables and then i was i'm gonna cheat here and lump together a couple of the other barriers so i don't depict uh wheeling issues we talked about quite a bit uh challenged around workforce to develop these and actually build these projects um and then obstacles around developing qf so there's a lot of discussion about the the reduction in opportunity with changes at the pvc on how qfs are are handled well that's a good one ranged far and wide that was um good thanks for uh thanks for boiling it down so maybe i don't know if we want to have kind of discussion or if we just want to move straight on to group two maybe we get all the all the groups out there and then we can kind of see if there's some themes developing here so um do we have a volunteer from group two i think that was our group and that's me okay can you hear me yeah uh yeah i think that was uh our group so this is uh acacia brockman oregon public utility commission we also had will van bachter from crook county and dan orzek from oregon clean power co-op and christy was our note taker so in terms of opportunities clean energy benefits available to how those can be monetized to help bring in dollars for projects the green community the community green tariff was offered today as one option utilities and developers working together on targeted resilience projects to help bring dollars and increase project development efficiency so this is doing projects that are beneficial both from the developer standpoint and from the utilities standpoint and then create extra credit for dual use which was does not exist now and there was a suggestion that massachusetts might be an example of having done this under barriers the patchwork of permitting programs financing land use regulations utility rules etc is a huge barrier oppositional nature of developers and goal 13 not a clear goal to help the state meet its clean energy goals and a couple of others the low avoided cost rates that these projects get paid and the fact that they're based on their small size they are expensive to build and so those rates don't make up the cost and for um projects in consumer owned utility territory that whole challenge that bpa described with not being able to build out in those territories thank you acacia and group three i was actually in that group as was alan and we didn't a spokesman at the time but anyone from group 3 3 want to jump in and summarize the discussion i came in late so i'll do it rob so um i think four points one was uh great access one particular line has three thousand megawatts in the queue of a lot of large projects 200 300 megawatt projects that really impacts smaller projects because you get in the queue and if it's if the uh it can take a long time or even be prohibitive of being able to get access to the grid another one was contractual issues that cause problems with on the revenue side so two things in particular the low avoided costs and the increased operational costs from contractual obligations that make make the cost of running the pro the project higher the third one we talked about was the lack of valuation of all the benefits attributed to the analogy on the energy efficiency side is is there's a whole movement looking at the value of of of energy efficiency to be incorporated into the cost effectiveness calculation that are not traditionally in the cost effectiveness calculation one of the acronyms we use here at odo for that is jedi crabber which kind of up with that in the chat but it's all the different acronym all the different kind of benefits that aren't included traditionally and then finally the um there's an idea of potentially uh dual contract tracks with with separate contracts for small and maybe a template that would help developers be able to make it through the process more efficiently and effectively that's it alrighty thank you alan and anyone else from group three that want to add anything to that um moving on to group four hey rob this is richie i tried very hard to get a non-odor group member to be a speaker and it didn't work so i will go ahead and do it take one for the team uh we talked about barriers around um interconnection can you there's a lot of sort of head nodding um there i think that",

        "text": " that's uh uh what i was alluding to earlier when we were talking about uh california is potentially being an off taker and you know there's still maybe a bottleneck at the inner tie so the ac the dc inner tie etc because uh in order to uh schedule energy to flow across those those those those facilities those paths you have to have transmission rights that you can utilize in order to do so and and transmission rights the amount of available transmission capacity are the things that are born out of the reliability planning processes and so that's why you know i again i just you know uh wanna and i probably sound like a a broken record uh i just wanna emphasize that um you know before uh uh we get too settled in on on really thinking that you know 2.6 or three or whatever is the number that the system can actually handle that we allow these processes to play themselves out um you know because you know uh just you know you know i don't want uh what i would hate to see is everybody get uh overly excited and then have you know when this analysis with respect to reliability gets done you know the reality be something uh you know smaller and it and and then not have the the stakeholders and the and folks working towards this effort be surprised by that so uh just again you know you just want to make sure and and and mention that and plug that and that being said uh you know this is a very worthwhile effort you know with respect to what it could potentially mean for the state so um you know we look forward to engaging with everybody on us thanks so much sean for for that um additional information um you know from the earlier slide that jason showed we have a number of experts on the line from um you know pge bonneville power pacific core that have experience actually owning transmission and doing this work so thank you sean and welcome um welcome those comments from our other colleagues as well as we go through the rest of the slides just wanted to mention there's a some really good information in the chat that we'll visit jason covers some of these more slides and some of these slides and continue to welcome raised hands and comments in the go ahead jason all right um yeah i just you know want to keep us moving here so we can close it too and uh you know wrap up with our next steps and still get through the energy market topic and we have one more guest speaker who has some more insight on you know some work being done on floating offshore winds so i'm going to push through these topics kind of signify where we got feedback on this topic of transmission infrastructure these subtopics i'm not going to read them off but there they are starting with um the existing transmission limits um we've talked about this you know a lot already today so um this shouldn't be a surprise but the completed studies indicate you know that potential for around two gigawatts um up and down the coast around all five of those all five of these maybe my mouse shows up um transmission substations that are you know all the way from story all the way down to coos bay essentially so that's pretty wide swath and then you've got the call area is more in the southern southern areas so um you know just trying to understand how how the dots connect kind of literally is the challenge and those studies were based on economic dispatch and physical transmission limits and so the need for additional studies is pretty immense so we're trying to trying to tackle that in bits and pieces more comments on transmission limits upgrades and costs you know you'll notice that there's limitations at each one of those points of interconnection that were studied 900 600 whatever they are you know none of them can accommodate two gigawatts alone so it'll probably maybe be most economic to break it apart but you know even that's an open question maybe maybe it's more cost effective at the end of the day at some time horizon in the future to to upgrade one one point of interconnection um but i'm not necessarily the best qualified power engineer what we did here was that even as little as 500 megawatts could could potentially result in upgrades costing millions of um and then reliability studies um of two gigawatts across multiple points of interconnection could require you know obviously significantly more upgrades and estimates for that that were put in the comments and there were actually some hard numbers but i think you know at this point is just billions of dollars right i mean um scale it up from millions to billions so this is infrastructure transmission is probably by far and away the most expensive part of the power grid um so transmission expansion expansion is costly in and of itself but it also has long lead times that i mentioned um you know again billion dollar items 10 to 15 years before construction can even begin transmission can provide regional benefits to optimize location and scale of renewable developments enhanced transfer capacities and bolster reliability we heard many folks chime in on that that theme and then the opportunity for optimizing you know with how expensive this is then that just really enhances the the need to optimize those costs as best as possible and collaborate on regional efforts to reduce those costs and maximize the benefits some early work on the east coast is is looking at different scenarios for flooding offshore wind so they're further along and have lease areas um kind of site site access already secured by developers and so this is uh coming at them a little bit quicker than it is here so we have a little more time to proactively plan um but they have been thinking about you know what's the difference between all these projects connecting on their own you know this is a super oversimplified um graphic on the top you could almost just imagine it just being a big ball of spaghetti and these lines crossing over each other and overlapping and kind of you know the complications that a scenario like that could pose and maybe the duplicative impacts or certainly the the least optimal impacts not only for the energy sector but also the environment and other ocean users so a lot of efforts are trying to how to how to synergize you know efforts and collaborate and come up with more simplified plans with less lines that can kind of use common common transmission lines to accomplish their so that kind of sums up the feedback what do we have here configurations so a little bit more on configurations um you know yeah we have to think about the economies of scale um there's it's kind of like chicken or egg or you know there's trade-offs like the bigger you get you know maybe the more economical floating offshore wind becomes but then maybe the transmission solutions become more um and maybe there's even a tipping point where a lot of transmission upgrades is could be great for the region and in the very long term you know this idea about rebalancing transmission flows um you know there could be trade-offs that upgrading coastal transmission could benefit different areas of the region so there's a lot more work to be done i'm just optimizing and looking at economies of scale mesh networks so that was kind of a concept from that last slide that's kind of what they call call these mesh networks out out at sea that can kind of interconnect and make common use of infrastructure out in the ocean and then reduce potentially reduce points of interconnection with the onshore onshore yeah and a lot a lot of people flagging that northern california has call areas too and oregon should be coordinating with northern california on transmission solutions so i think some evidence of that is um is underway with with the early days of the study that we're working with california energy commission on proactively planning for design of offshore transmission configurations um i think this is something josh made a comment on just on the last round of comments there about future proofing or you know if if early projects can can potentially happen without regional coordination um to at least kind of think about ways to make those projects be able to um interconnect with each other provide synergistic benefits for the grid in the future definitely have heard about the big transmission players in the i've made mention of them they were you identified on our northern grid topic i think sean with pg's mentioned the need for this collaborative work to unfold with um all the transmission providers but certainly certainly the more significant ones in the region um yeah i think that's because that covers that slide and we got through it so one more chance um here and then to 130 so you know at this point we basically have half an hour for energy markets and it'll probably be 20 minutes if we if we save some time for next steps so yeah i think that's great um i agree that we're running a little short on time here and we really want to get to markets um because a lot of the questions in the chat are asking about off takers and um kind of some of the market implications of offshore win so i'm going to hold a little bit on on some of those but um i want to make sure that we don't have any specific questions or any other perspectives or emphasis to add on the topics and themes that jason just covered um and just um let me see here for anyone on the phone star three to raise your hand and star six to mute and unmute um and i'm gonna go to harvey go ahead arby oh uh i was just curious and maybe this should have been the closing comment but anyway uh and on this columns that went columns how are they uh how are the pieces connected are they welded together or they has an internal bolt ring the the put the sections of the uh the uh the column in place is that how's that connected uh if it's welded you're going to need a lot of uh you're gonna be and you need to beef up that connection point to prevent uh fatigue uh cracking uh from the wind uh to uh causing a possible structural failure but i'm not i just wanna curious what how are you connecting those uh sections in that call when uh determine column thank you this is jason hey um i think i would love to follow up with harvey offline um and try to help answer his questions he's got a wealth of questions and great ones um they're kind of more on the building and engineering aspects um which we tried to talk about a little bit earlier but we're moving through all these topics pretty quickly um so appreciate that there's still questions um but but maybe try to keep our",

        "text": " the council mandating use of of one of those methodologies or or adapting one of those methodologies for use in the upset process and maybe while you're thinking about that Fuji I did see that you're so go ahead very well folks are thinking about that I just want to correct Irene it wasn't 100 25 miles from the interpretive center it's 125 ft it's just that's okay but uh um I think if there was to be still some variability in the methods I'm not comfortable really with that but that at a minimum they should stay the most updated uh manual um when I'm talking about cherry picking I'm talking about you know things that I'll just say it Idaho Power has used in the board Hemingway uh analysis so we'll go for 1974 in the forest service we'll go to 19768 I mean it's 86 and the BLM blah blah blah so it needs to be the most updated if you're going to use those resources and then this term of significant as Irene is talking about even if you use well or the the blms and you have high impact high impact high impact high impact and then Odo comes out for no significant impact how can you come up with no significant impact when all the other metrics have said high impact so I think that it's really difficult because Scenic is a subjective thing maybe Dean can help us a bit with this but I think that this there needs to possibly be some kind of a um a panel or some kind of independent look at those analysis let's face it Odo who's doing the review and putting out the draft proposed order and proposed orders are being paid by the developers we know this there seems to be an inherent problem in this whole process so if there can be some little independent of something to look at the data and say okay what's the conclusion rather than the conclusion being oh no significant impact Almost 100% of the time then uh you know I think that might add a little validity to the process anyway I'll leave it at that you guys know this is a Hot Topic for me sorry ranting here you go yeah this is Dean again I I have been having trouble getting my hand up again I I thought I had solved the problem and now it's not helping me anyway the prop gu go ahead de I have work I work both sides of the fence currently I'm working for developers who are trying to develop offshore wind uh on the east coast and I have worked for developers in Oregon as well I've also worked for the opposition on projects so I'm not I'm not here as an advocate for anything in particular just for a good process um you know H having said that uh there are some things that that you can work on I'm talking about FC um to really improve things and one of the areas that I think should be looked at is it's a really important Clause that you have that says if there is I don't know if I'm going to get the terminology right but if there is a significant adverse impact on visual resources you don't leave yourself any out the project has to be turned down just on that basis or won't am I correct that um yeah it would well there is um a method through which um we could do a what's called a balancing determination and applies to at least some of these standards well one of the one of of the issues that I've encountered is that because of that particular standard it makes it difficult for a developer and their consultant to do a fully throw honest assessment of visual impacts because if they do and they find it's significantly adverse they're kind of derailing their and we you need some kind of out clause that allows mitigation to happen including off-site mitigation including payments to the community or the people affected uh you need a way to um allow for a a more honest assessment that's not deliberately kind of downplaying the impacts that's one thing the other thing is uh was it Fuji I think was saying that uh having some sort of independent assessment particularly in any kind of controversial project I think is really important uh to be able to pull in one or two outside experts who aren't paid by a developer who are you know are not paid by Advocates who are trying to stop the project to have them come in and take a look and see if the assessment was done properly and see if the findings are defensible uh might be a good a good process for f FC to consider um that's thanks Dean and I will just make one point to address that I should have said mitigation can be considered when we're making our final determination of significance um and that would usually things like include things like like sighting conditions to eliminate facility components from certain areas or design conditions to use you know um design features that are more visually subordinate um but that does vary significantly from Pro but there there are going to be times and places where you are unable to mitigate a project down to something below significant adverse um these projects are big they take up a lot of space they're they're seen from a lot of areas and um so I'm just saying that you you you can't rely on that Clause uh that you're going to be able to mitigate your way out of it you might not be able to mitigate your way out of it but you don't want to to be a make or break for the entire project you want to be able to still approve the project but find other ways to compensate uh for the problems that it creates great thanks um Jon thanks Chris um this is Joselyn P's outside council with power um and I just wanted to respond to your request Chris for a developer perspective um and i' note also that a number of folks on the line today have raised some specific um criticisms of the B2 process and I don't intend to get into all of that here in this setting um I I don't think that's really appropriate for for this discussion but would add thank you for that Jo when um Idaho Power was um was approaching developing a methodology uh initially my understanding is that initially they had used one of the federal methodologies and the feedback from Odo was that that methodology didn't adequately account for what the council focuses on which is the definition of signific if in the rules and so I think that that's one thing to be mindful of in looking sort of outside at Federal plan at Federal methodologies is how how that fits back in with what the council's looking at and I mean I I I don't have our our visual resources expert on with me today to weigh in about um the various methodologies that are out there but I guess I would say another consideration that was relevant for b2h as well is looking at a large scale linear facility where you're Crossing multiple um Land Management jurisdictions including both BLM and Forest Service um and trying to come up with a um an approach for evaluating uh res sources that that are under those different management jurisdictions um so I I just offer those um General General comments and if there's anything um specific that you were looking for Chris um as far as input I could see if I could help out that um thanks JN yeah no um I I think it was just looking for General feedback there but I I think what you raised is very very helpful and um I I think we're probably about ready for a break so to kind of um is that we we've heard a lot that that we definitely need to have some methodology and or maybe a menu of methodologies that are accepted uh for the council process but at least something so that there's some uh meaningful Clarity in what is required and then um johon I think what you just kind of brought up and maybe this is consistent with what Irene was saying was that if we are going to specify a methodology be used that we should also be using that methodology's determination of significance and maybe make sure that we're not circling back around to the the council's rule and kind of overriding something um or at least confusing the issue of what that means um uh which I think is very very good feedback and something that we'll have to look at carefully because I don't know if that's something that we had previously um and it looks like Angela has your you have your hand up so I'll give you the last yeah thanks I just briefly um i' like what you just said about a menu of options I think that's especially important since different resources have very different types of visual impact so I like that menu idea great well um with that thanks again I think that was uh very very productive and we got a lot of good uh impact there and definitely have some homework to do on this question um our next two issues again are are related to the identification of resources so um let's come back and start working talking through those and um does does a 10-minute break sound okay to everybody I'll just assume you're all shaking your head so uh what's reconvene maybe in 10 minutes that would be uh 5 till 3 o'cl okay we're and it looks like it's just about time so hopefully most folks are back that's break my present again okay um so welcome back um hopefully you all were able to stretch out and get a drink of water um before we start our discussion of our issue uh which is um whether applicants should be required to review state Land Management plans when are tring to find significant or important uh Scenic resources um um so the current Scenic resources standard protects Scenic resources and values identified as significant or important in local land use plans tribal management plans and Federal Land Management plans um uh and an analysis is required for impacts to those resources um there are some State Land Management plans which establish Scenic corridors and bikeways and some other Scenic resources that are not currently included in the rule but are generally uh still reviewed for impacts um so we are asking specifically whether or not um those State Management plans should be included uh We've also had a comment from our recommendation from one stakeholder that um Regional and Interstate plans such as the Columbia Gorge National Scenic area management plan um should be included in the rule um so we'd appre any feedback on that recommendation and then a few folks have questioned whether or not um the basis using Land Management plans as the basis for uh the rules is appropriate at all so in our discussion questions for this uh particular issue um we have three questions that we kind of like some input on one whether Scenic resources a yeah so one whether there is",

        "text": " someone from the growth services department, whether Mister risen or someone, will stand up in a moment and read off those two consent agenda items. Generally speaking, what's on the consent agenda is an item as to which we have not received any public opposition before this meeting today, if you have an opposition to one of these two items, or even if you have a question about one of them when they're read off, raise your hand. And if you just have a question, we'll see if we can answer that question quickly. If you have an objection, then we'll put that item on the next part of the agenda, the items for individual consideration. If we don't have anybody raise your hand, then the board will take one vote to a single motion to approve both of those consent agenda items. After that, we'll go into the items for individual consideration. The first four items are somewhat related to each other as far as the party involved. And then after that, we'll go into two requests for special use permits and a rezoning request. Those items are, as the chairman indicated, are quasi judicial matters. That means the board is basically sitting like a judge in court. It's important for you to understand that the board's decision has to be based on what the courts call competent, substantial evidence. That means you should, when you're up here at the podium speaking, you should be speaking from personal knowledge about what you're talking about. The information you're conveying should be relevant to the questions before the board. In the case of the rezoning, the first question is and the special use permit, are those items consistent with our comprehensive land use plan? That would certainly be relevant to the board. And then the question is, are those items compatible with the surrounding property? Many times that seems to be the focal point of people who are here in opposition, is whether they think the item is not compatible with the surrounding property. And then a related item is whether the request is in the public interest. So, for instance, if you have some information about maybe traffic conditions related to the application or the current state of affairs, the status quo state of affairs, you can address that if you think there's some environmental issue. In the case of the special use permits of, generally speaking, special use permit items are not principal uses within a zoning category, and that's why they're called special use permits. The unique feature of a special use permit application is that the board can impose conditions on the approval of the special use permit. Generally, the idea of the conditions is to ensure that the application is consistent with the surrounding uses. So again, if you're here on one of those items and you have some objection to whether the request is compatible with the surrounding area, if you've looked at, or if you here today, listen to the conditions, if you think they're not adequate to address your concern, you can request the board to enhance one of the conditions. On the other hand, if you're an applicant and you think one of the conditions is not necessary at all, you have that option as well. And the board will consider those things. Again, it's important to understand that the board's decision has to be based on confident, substantial evidence, which is different than saying, when you come up to the podium, well, I'm just against it, or, I never have liked this kind of thing, or. Or things like, we have too many people moving to Ocala. Those kinds of opinions are basically irrelevant to these kinds of questions. You know, your testimony needs to relate to the specific application. In just a moment, I'm going to ask everybody who has any intention to come up and testify about any of these items, I'm going to have you stand up, and I'm going to put you under oath in mathematic so that we don't have to do it each time. And so anybody that's going to speak on any of these issues, even if you think there's a possibility, go ahead and stand up and raise your hand, right hand, and repeat after me. I solemnly swear or affirm the testimony I will give today will be the truth and nothing but the truth. Be the truth and nothing but the truth. Under penalty of law. Under penalty of law. Okay, thank you. Be seated. Okay, mister Chairman, we can go into the consent agenda. Good job. All right, we have two items for consent you want to address. Director of growth services. The following items are for your consideration. Planning, zoning consent items. Item number 15. 1.1,230,806 zC. Michael and Katherine Seimer. Zoning change from residential mixed use, four reals, to general agriculture. A 150.48 acres parcel, account number 4481. Sorry, 448-8100 at 2200 Southeast 175th Street, Summerfield, Florida. Item number 15. 1.2,230,807 ZC. Elizabeth C. Towery, revocable trust. Betty Towery, Hackmeyer. Zoning change from single family dwelling r1 and community business b. Two to heavy business b. 516.0 acres parcel, account number 133700, at 210 five Northwest 52nd Street, Ocala, Florida. These are for your consideration. Is there anyone in the audience that wishes to pull or talk about either one of these consent items? Okay, bring it back to the board. Approval motion by Commissioner Bryant to approve 15.1.1 and 15. 115.1. .2 seconded by commissioner Stone. Any comment? All in favor say aye. Those like sign. Okay, that motion passes unanimously. Now we will move into the individual consideration items. Staff will present these just for informational purposes because 15 2.1 relies on 15 2.2 and 15 2.3. We're going to take all of these at one time, but. And we have to vote on them individually, but we will vote on 15.1, which is the first one toward the end, once we have dealt with the public hearing items. So here you go. Good afternoon. Chris Risen with the growth services offices. Our first four items this afternoon deal with a project which is now currently titled the Pioneer Ranch, which is a planned unit development project. The property's holdings are largely what used to be portions of the JB ranch project, which is located adjoining at the property to the east. With this area, you'll notice the bold outline are the portions of the now Pioneer ranch development. And then the JB ranch area is this area to the east, which these are somewhat older aerials, so it is much more developed at this point in time. To give you a bearing, and I apologize for the little bit of blurriness here, but these are the four items that we're going to be dealing with. The initial item is the actual approval of the master plan for the Pioneer ranch PUd, or plan unit development, and then three items which relate to development agreements that were required when comprehensive plan amendments were originally granted for this property's holdings. The first one, of course, is the original parent area, which includes the area where Southwest 95th street moves through the project development, and then two additional areas, which are these two items here which are located to the northwest in the vicinity, and those two items, just to let you know, make up this holding. And then the original item are these two holdings right here that also extend westward towards 200 in relation to the overall site. The current land use designations in the vicinity are medium residential, which applies to the full PD area, and then additionally it is currently zoned PD from the Pioneer Ranch UD rezoning, which was done in 2021. General familiarity for the surroundings. The property is largely agricultural purposes. There is a historic residence on one of the parcels. The area is a combination of residential subdivisions and some commercial properties. Just for reference, this commercial area that you see here is now actually under development as the Westshire Village Pud, which is a multifamily rental development. Overall for the JV ranch project, they were approved for their south and central portion originally along 95th Street Road. There were expansionaries to the west and the northwest, and then they had development agreements that were acquired. The JB Ranch Pud began with the construction also of 95th street coordinated 95th Street Road. Excuse me. However, the economic downturn did result in suspension of the residential development. The property ownership later changed and it separated out the Pioneer Ranch portion from JB Ranch. JB Ranch phases one and two are completed and under construction with residential development occurring. And then the central and western parts were acquired with that new separate developers following the 2008 downturn. The current project size of Pioneer Ranch is approximately 268 acres, including that central west area and then the two expansion parcels. These, for reference, are the current conditions for the plan unit development conditions for the the JB ranch project, which were its approval conditions in 2021. A key concern are these portions here, which are item number twelve, which reflects the buffer requirements along the JV Ranch development, or along the countryside farm subdivision, which is located to the south of the project. Specifically, overall, this is their master plan. This is 95th street moving through the project. This is the northern portion, including the expansion area. This is the southern portion that then moves westward. And this area lying right here and just below it, is the countryside farms development project. Right here. In the inside, just for reference, is their recommendation or their proposal for the countryside farms buffer and current conditions. And that is actually one of the discussions related to the development agreement that is coming up. This is a",

for all right i will bring that back to the team as i said we're scoping our report um right now so i will i will propose it to the team and share that there's a lot of interest thank you thank you any final questions or comments for adam or stephanie this is ken i would just say uh it's been a fascinating presentation and todd thank you very much for getting these folks uh to do this for us some of these questions came up and and you know i don't feel comfortable answering answering them other than a very very generic way so you know we've got experts you basically heard from to the experts at the agency so i just want to say thank you guys very very much this has been tremendously helpful hopefully for for council certainly for staff because you know it helps us understand a little more broadly you know how we fit into the the broader energy sector you know we we are one small piece i like to say that we're an important piece but it's only a small piece and i think this helps us understand kind of the bigger picture and so this this was very very helpful for me when todd i would say uh don't under don't understand yourself you know showing the scale of the build a lot of this stuff you see up here right now right that's fossil based that's other sectors it's moving your right uh the next 20 years it's sort of i think it's going to be a real issue in our industry of just the scale of the development we need to meet our carbon goals it's it's going to come and come at us very fast because i know you're already starting to see but it's it's only going to accelerate yep good point thank you all for having us you're welcome thanks again all right team council we are now at our lunch break would you like how much time would you like 15 minutes good for folks sounds good give us a little more now huh you mean more than you can have as much as you want we are we are 16 minutes uh todd what were you saying i was just saying we are running ahead on the agenda so i mean it obviously whatever you guys want we'll be fine um but yeah so if it's 15 or more i think we're we're good on on timing but with what's the council's pleasure i am wide open why don't you why don't you give us um one if you can we can do that let's re recess until one everybody okay with that i see heads nodding thank you everyone please take a break until 1 pm thank you it's now 1pm and i would like to call the meeting back from recent recess and continue on with the next agenda item we are ready to do that um the next agenda item is agenda item h it's the golden hills win project council review of construction this is an information item dwayne killsdock odo compliance officer and sarah esterson odo senior policy advisal will provide a dwayne sarah the floor is yours very much i'm just waiting wally can you make it so you can i can take the screen absolutely excuse me one moment here if you want to keep it it's fine i'm happy to just say advanced okay you should have it okay thumbs up for sharing screen great thank you so much okay so um thank you chair grail and vice chair howe members of the council for the record my name is sarah esterson i'm the senior policy advisor with the oregon department of energy sighting division and i along with my colleague dwayne kilstonk our compliance officer in the signing division will be providing you an update on compliance issues at the golden house one project advance please so oh i'm sorry i have it so quick overview of the facility so the golden hills one project is an approved 400 megawatt wing facility it's currently under construction the final design of the the constructed facility is 200 megawatts with 51 wind turbines it's in sherman county the certificate holder is golden hill's wind farm llc which is a subsidiary of oven grid renewables and construction commenced in 2020 it started with the operation and maintenance building and is forecasted to be complete in april so in just about three months where we expect for reclamation to extend through the spring if not the so just a little bit more reference on the location so this figure that you're seeing seeing shows the site boundary of the facility if you can see my cursor the dark green line is the site boundary as you know that's an f-sect defined term it's supposed to represent the perimeter of the energy facility and related or supporting facilities for this facility the site boundary clearly extends far beyond that and almost 30 000 acres this facility also has an approved micro siting corridor which is an area that's been approved to site facility components anywhere within and that follows the turbine strings and roads so these dots that you see are are turbine locations and strings and the are roads and that micro sighting area is about 7 thousand acres uh just for a little bit more now that doesn't mean that's seven thousand acres of disturbance it's just a seven thousand acre area where facility components could be located given um the level of analysis that the certificate holder did during the permitting process and um for a little bit more context of the size of this site um if you can see my cursor again down here is the town of moro up here is the city of wasco and the distance between these two points is about 11 acres so just imagine a site where work is extending across 7 000 acres and 11 miles it's quite a big site it is commensurate with other wind facility sites but nonetheless it's it's a very large site okay and one more figure um this gives you just a little bit more regional context than an aerial overlay so here's just where that is in sherman county and some primary roads that's the 97 and 208 okay so now we've set the stage you know what the facility is and where it's at so we'd like to move into the compliance update um hopefully you recall we've been providing updates to council on this project of the last four council meetings uh starting in august this is our fifth update um and so given you know the duration of this issue and the tracking of this issue we thought it would be more appropriate to present as a formal agenda item or the past four have been presented really just during council secretary cornett's secretary report so what is the issue the current issue um the primary issue of compliance that we're tracking is with uh a certificate condition that's referred to as gen sp01 and the subsequent impacts to resources that are intended to be protected by complying with that condition and that includes agricultural soils which is protected by council soil protection and land use standard and then waters of the state which is by that condition it's also protected by a mandatory condition that says a certificate holder is obligated to comply with all state permits and all state regulations applicable to the siting of the facility and specifically this condition gen sp01 requires that all construction work be conducted in compliance with the erosion sediment control plans that are authorized and required under a deq issued 1200 c permit and i wanted to just kind of sidestep for one second and make sure that the council understands or has a little bit more knowledge if you don't have it already of what a 1200 c permit is so that permit again it's issued by the department of environmental quality and it's intended to protect waters of the state from stormwater runoff during and it requires um it's very fairly technical and it requires detailed engineering drawings and site-specific selection of uh erosion control and materials based on the layout of the facility and the site it has to be prepared by a qualified individual an engineer or soil specialist and then once that permit and those plans are approved and issued um compliance with that permit has to be monitored by an individual with specialized training so it's uh it is a fairly robust permit um and so for this project the council relied on the certificate holder's ability and obligation to comply with those erosion sediment control plans and permit to find that erosion impacts to agricultural soils would be minimized this is a fairly standard and accepted in this in the site certificate process okay so now i'd like to just move back over to the staff report that you received as part of this council packet in that staff report for this agenda item we presented an overview of the timeline of of when this issue was identified and everything well generally the steps that the department and the certificate holder has taken in response to the i'm not going to walk you through the entirety of the outline in that staff report um but just generally this started for us in late august when we received a formal complaint that was signed by 11 tenant farmer landowners that were impacted by construction activities where they were alleging excessive disturbance inadequate topsoil management and that the certificate holder hadn't consulted with them on various components of the final facility design all of those things do have a nexus to site certificate conditions um so you know and we provided that complaint to the certificate holder and we updated counsel of that complaint and we responded fairly immediately requesting that the certificate holder their compliance documentation and information so that we can evaluate the legitimacy of the complaint that was and the certificate holder also uh you know identified additional corrective measures that they would do in response to this complaint and at that point uh we we also dwayne and our consultant from haley aldrich had immediately went out and conducted a site inspection and had concerns about soil management and wind erosion which are reported to the certificate holder and that's when we start we reached out to deq since this was also falling in the realm of compliance with the 1200 c and i just want to keep making a distinction where deq and their role with the 1200c is because it's a of waters of the state protection we're relying on deq to enforce and manage that aspect of it and to the extent that that 1200 seat permit and those plans is was relied upon by council to protect agricultural soils that's kind of the the issue that we're trying or tracking um on our own but",

        "text": " thank you so much. I think my question is about the hills, the state plan. So that's currently under rulemaking and currently challenged in the court right now, the climate protection plan. And that is specific to the natural gas and stationary fuel sector. So that doesn't have anything to do with the requirements for electric utilities to reduce their or to decarbonize their systems. It's a different sector. Okay, so then the target is what you're saying through all of our energy requirements as a state. That's why it goes down to zero. And we're predicting industrial process and product use to stay roughly flat. Well, there's, there's no specific, you know, laws that are driving that down at this point. So this is just modeling what's on the books for state of Oregon laws. I think there are some federal laws reducing a little bit in terms of, like, reform refrigerants, but that's not, we use some specialty processes and products here in Hillsboro, and there's nothing specifically driving those down at this point. And then the transportation energy is predicted to go down. And what's the basis of that? Just increased fuel efficiency or is there other factors there? There are other factors, and let me make a note to get those specifically to you. I know there's. So there's some rules around bringing in lower emissions vehicles to the state. I believe we're following the California rule that requires passenger vehicles sold from 2035 on to be electric. So there's modeling of that, assuming that a certain number of people are adopting EV's from that point on. So that drives down. We also have a clean fuel standard in Oregon that's driving down the, actually the carbon footprint of our liquid fuels currently. Like we're transitioning a lot to a more renewable diesel from a biofuel that was more conventional diesel. So there's a few different things, but I can send you the specifics on that. That'd be great. And then my last question would be, how does population growth fit in here? I don't know the answer to that question. I'll have to ask our consultants. That was my question too. Is it, does this take into account the growth of Hillsboro? Because if we're not hitting the goal as is, and it doesn't take into account the growth, that's something we're going to have to adjust for. But these are regulatory measures that we are goals that we've strived for, but industries also reforming and cleaning up, basically. So that's going to contribute also to our goal, right? Yes. Yeah. There's a lot of our corporate partners that are doing. They have like larger corporate goals for decarbonizing their systems and their processes. So that's going to be driving things down naturally as well. Councillor Sinclaire? Hi, this is Councillor Sinclair. What are some of the regulatory hurdles that you see happening currently due to our industrial partners? Another good question that I don't have an answer off the top of my head. Councillor Sinclair, let me look into that and get back to you. Thank you. And just to add, I think part of why I'm asking the question is because it feels like, and tell me if I'm wrong, this serves as the basis for figuring out what our mitigation actions are, correct? Yes, we're kind of looking at that delta to get to that zero by 20, net zero by 2050. So we're looking at those things that can help drive that down. We are not specifically looking at industrial process emissions, but I think Councilor Sinclair has a good question, like what are those hurdles for those companies that are in our community? How can we support them to get there to drive those down? It could be that they have such specialized processes that they were going to have to offset those emissions in other ways through sequestration or carbon offsets. I don't know that we have the technology. I feel like if we had the technology to reduce those emissions to zero, they would be on the leading edge of getting there. But it could be that we just don't have that technology developed quite yet. Another question yeah, this is possible. You say that we won't hit the goal with our current plan. Do you think it's possible to hit the goal ever? Yes. You do? Yes. And similar to our industrial partners, we'll probably have to look at things like offsets and other ways to drive those things down. Like if you all need to fly somewhere that has a greenhouse gas emissions footprint, but there are offsets that can be invested in as a way to allow you to travel. So unless we get to a point where we're just like, literally not moving anywhere, we're probably going to have transportation emissions footprints, our building sector that's getting driven down naturally. But some of these other things we're just not going to be able to fully, like, eliminate. Right, right. And on the topic of air travel. So thanks for bringing that up. Does this take into account what Hio is putting out? What Hillsborough airport is putting out? It is. Okay. So you're not putting that aside as though it's port of Portland and not part of Hillsboro. You are including. It's actually both. And let's see. So air travel is included in that transport. It's on the top of that transportation bar. And that looks at both travel from Hillsborough airport as well as an estimate of. Actually, I take that back. I believe the green bar includes the Hillsboro travel because we can actually measure that from fuel sales. The magenta bar on the top that says air travel, that's the estimated amount of PDX travel that Hillsborough residents are contributing. Oh, so that's based on. So the top bar is based on, like, population and sort of internationally recognized estimates of how much people travel in the community. So just to be sure, I understand the green bar is from hio. And the top magenta bar, where it says air travel, is people leaving Hillsborough going to PDX and flying out of PDX. Yeah. And then. So the green bar, the majority of the green bar is you driving cars? That's cars, yeah. And a little bit of that is the trucks on the road. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions before I move us on? Okay, let's move forward. Okay. So this spring we hosted three community stakeholder workshops with experts who work or volunteer in the sectors with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. So we discussed the most promising activities to cut emissions for consideration in our climate plan. In transportation, we discussed plans to support electric vehicle charging in more parts of the city and strategies to make transit more equitably available and a viable option for more people. We're also looking at ways to make the city more bike friendly and moving toward expanding the availability of renewable diesel at our gas stations. In building energy, we talked about city support for programs to enable home energy efficiency projects, more home energy scoring, and city owned battery storage systems. In consumption, we shared a need to consider ways to promote more plant based eating, especially reducing our beef and dairy intake. We also discussed ways to ensure the community has information and tools to reduce food waste and compost food scraps. And we're looking at low carbon concrete standards. So our consultant team is currently evaluating these that I just mentioned, as well as other recommendations to help us scale the impacts of the actions, prioritize them, and develop partnerships to implement the measures. So in June, you got a chance to hear from the Youth Advisory council's climate Resilience and Sustainability subcommittee, who developed the city's climate change page in coordination with the city's communications and sustainability teams. The new page is linked from the city's sustainability page, or you can go directly there using the QR code shown on this slide. So we're glad to have this site available to provide data driven information, helpful resources for our community, and as a place to share updates as we build our climate action plan. The page includes information about what the city is doing, ways community members can take action, and programs that help address the impacts of our changing climate. Robin, I believe Castor Sinclair has a question. Thank you. Thank you so much. This is Councillor Sinclair. Robin, how often does DEQ submit admissions reports to Hillsboro? And what, as a partner, what is their plan for projected growth in maintaining? I do not know the answer to those questions, so I'm going to jot those down and get back to you on those. Unless anyone else knows about our, the reporting we get from DEQ. I don't get specific reports, but someone in the city may be getting. Okay. Okay. I'll look into that and see if I can find out some more information. Thank you so much, Robin. And councillor Alcare, I'm not sure if you. I do have a question, Robin, can you go back to the slide before this one? Yes. So for consumption, are we. These things are things that are being considered in the workshops, are we. Well, is consumption also, are we prescribing diet changes that people should consider making or should start making? And I'm, I'm, I'm not against this, but I'm just reluctant to say that without, like, USDA present. No, the city will not be. Yeah, we're not. Yeah. So there won't be any prescriptive diet recommendations from the city. The idea is to help people understand the carbon footprint of their various food choices. So what we know from all the research that's been done and all of the calculations that have been done is that there are certain foods that have a very high carbon footprint, especially if we are importing them into the community. So, for instance, production of beef is extremely energy and water intensive. It requires a lot of inputs. And so that's one of the things that we want to show to people. Now",

        "text": " together um is there anyone with blue mountain specifically daniel kearns with us today if so speak up or raise a hand please okay i'm not noting anyone um ms sloane there in salem do you have anyone present yes we do sorry so i'm gonna i'm gonna let him introduce he has his mic on richard jolly with blue mountain okay great and mr jolly um what is your affiliation with blue mountain alliance and daniel kearns can you explain that just a little bit to me yes i'm a member of the board and the board selected daniel kearns as our uh to contact um you in your office and i hadn't heard back from him and so i uh contacted the office also okay and are you expecting that mr kearns is going to appear at all today at this public no i don't believe so but i believe he responded and has sent in our statement okay and so i did receive this email from him um that included an attached letter and mr jolly have you had an opportunity to look at that i haven't so it's rather lengthy but what i'm gonna do is i am gonna read uh the portion of the email from mr he indicates that the he attached a letter that he has offered for my consideration he says he represents the blue mountain alliance and its members and the members have focused on working with umatilla on this and other wind power projects my clients however only recently realized that the counties may 26 comments were very narrowly drawn focusing only on efsc's rules and not on the statute or case law precedent my clients had hoped and assumed that they could comment after may 26 2 and including today's continuance however they did not see the county's comments or staff response until after the may 26 hearing which now appears to be when the record closed to further comment please therefore accept the short comment into the record and then there's a letter attached it's about uh two full pages mr jolly can i ask did blue mountain alliance provide any comments on the record at the original may 26th public hearing no we did not okay and is there any reason that you didn't provide those public comments or provide any public comments at that time yes there were there was a couple of factors that have uh gone on it was not brought up to our attention that uh this sighting was going to go around the county's uh ordinances that were in place and it was brought to our attention that that was the intent of this and so then we tried to uh catch up and and get on board okay and when did that come to your right at that time was it before i was at the meeting yes okay and um was it was anyone from blue mountain alliance present at the meeting no one no one from blue mountain alliance was present at that meeting no okay so how then did it come to your because other people that had been at that meeting told us about it and we looked into it and saw that that's what was uh transpiring okay and what did you what was it that you looked into and and how did you find that information out i got online and uh looked up the project site and all the paperwork and and tried to see the uh citing analysis and what they were trying to do and it looked i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off there no problem was there anything else you want to add on that okay and is there any reason that you um you or anyone with blue mountain alliance didn't do that prior to the public hearing well i was out of state working and then i had been sick and then uh i just hadn't been paying attention to f-sec and a person that was supposed to be looking at f-sec we just had it it was just oversight that uh failed us jolly before i make a ruling is there anything else that you'd like me to know about this not unless we're gonna be able to have some standing um is there anyone else that wants to be heard on blue mountain alliance's motion to submit a comment at this point okay mr rhode does the department have any position on it that they'd like to your honor we don't have a position i would just share what would need to happen procedurally if the council were to consider the they wish they would i would recommend that they first clearly establish what standard they would apply to it uh presumably it would be a good cause second if uh if if the comment period were to be it should be done for the public in general not just for the parties that requested it that would allow other persons who relied on the deadline as it was noticed to also make comments if they wish that would require re-noticing uh the the deadline in order to make the public aware that it's been extended and then the applicant as has been done with the last meeting and today's would need to be afforded the opportunity if they wish respond to any additional comments so procedurally that's how that would it would need to need to go we don't have a position as to whether or not the request should be granted and as far as council establishing a good cause standard or some sort of standard such as a good cost standard is that something that uh council would vote on or make a decision or is that something that i as the presiding officer would make that decision do you you know this hasn't come up uh i think it would be best that the situation we have is that in the future similar such requests could come up and so i think that there should be some discussion if council wishes to consider it what standard would be applied and if that would be a good cause standard uh if you had other thoughts to share with the council about what other types of standard but if they're going to consider it i think we need to establish on the record what that standard would be so were this issue to come up in the future council would be consist consistent in the manner in which it treats such what you know not much but further in the future i would recommend that council also then establish a rule that formalizes what standard it would apply obviously we don't have that now uh but uh i would if council if if you want to solicit input from the council as to whether or not they should consider this then i think that we ought to have discussion of what standard would be applied to the request that sounds reasonable to me would council like to consider this request and have some sort of discussion about what sort of standard would be applied to this request i think um i think that likely a good cause standard would be the most common uh there could also be just a a hard standard of you know uh you know if a request is made and it's after the the close of that initial record for public comment no further comments are allowed for any but would anyone on council like to be heard on that so are we if anybody has anything to say i guess now it's an appropriate time this is chair grill madam chair this is hanley go ahead natalie well this is this is difficult because process has afforded a lot of opportunity for public comment um and my concern is that where do we stop we're going to get in the merry ground here and because now if we allow additional public comment then we have to allow additional applicant response to that comment i agree with patrick that if we reopen the record at this late date then we are we need to have a very good reason to do otherwise we're going to be subject to reopening the record maybe multiple times thank you unlike anyone else go ahead ken yeah i'm other like mind i don't need to repeat what hanley said there i agree thank you ken cindy condon um i agree also but i do have uh just a question i guess that were we to um allow for it is we'd have to consider that a good cause is this is a question out of town or simply didn't look at the material that was available considerable period of time i guess those are are those good cause um i don't know if that's what's going to answer that or is it just has it ever been has good been defined i'm sure for the record todd cornett and i'm gonna look to largely patrick um to respond to this but i'll give some parameters you know and so the you know and as um lj uh triana said you know whether you can just have a very clear um standard or it's very open-ended good cause you know just by its very nature is kind of a subjective determination so you would determine on a case-by-case basis unless you know you put in some parameters today to say these are the parameters of good cause and then you would apply that to this particular request and as patrick had mentioned you know the concern there is making sure that you know you're being consistent for future requests as um so again you know good cause generally is a fairly open-ended concept whether you put parameters on that or whether you come up with you know another standard if you choose to it's much more sort of definitive i mean i think that's really what the question is to counsel is you know what are your thoughts on this do you want to apply some sort of you know standard verbally now and as patrick said you know if we think this is going to be something in the future probably rule making would be the better way to do it because then you would have it you know more clearly established on the record with the language but also with the rule making history so i'm going to go back to patrick to you know probably either validate or alter anything that i yeah that that's a a great description i think todd i i think it's you know essentially note when you see it i don't have the case lot at my fingertips i'm sure i could find it's probably some case law though i could provide find examples but unfortunately i don't have that for you now one thing that comes to mind would be if if someone was entitled to notice for example if they had put their name on the uh the list of the persons that request notice of uh f second department actions and for some reason the department did not provide them that notice even though they had asked for it that would be good cause uh you know it's simply not looking uh you know knowing that you know fsec does regular business but not staying up to date",

        "text": " the people that live at Oak Run are unusual people. And some of my favorite people are in the room right now. We're fing a f out in a minute. Yeah, you're fixing a find out how unusual. Let me address three issues in the staff report, one of which is not really a big issue. I think they misinterpreted what Mister Reon was saying. We lost four to three at PNC. And afterwards, I asked one of the commissioners, PNC commissioners, why voted that way. I usually don't, but because he'd seemed like he didn't have a problem with it. He said that staff said that because we couldn't meet the buffer requirement that he was against it. Now, that's kind of odd for a pud, because that's kind of what you're know in there dealing with, but. So there was a misunderstanding. Staff is not saying, make us put up the buffers. You're going to hear from the next door neighbor. I hope you're going to hear from her. I hope she's here. And I hope she says the same thing she did last time, that she doesn't want a buffer there. So buffers are not the issue. I also don't think traffic's the issue. You heard the minimal amount of people that come here. No increase, commissioner. She couldn't expand that. If she wanted to it they on a four lane road, which is very unusual for a project to that. Here's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about compatibility because this is fascinating. Staff pointed out correctly that compatibility, this is in your report, is a condition in which land uses or conditions can coexist in relative proximity to each other in a stable fashion over time, such that no use or condition is unduly negatively impacted directly or indirectly by another use or condition. Here we have uses that have coexisted immediately next to residential homes. It's not relative proximity, it's contiguity. We've had them going on for 30 some odd years with coexistingot over time. The non residential uses had been in those building for 35 years. And yet all that time there's been only one complaint. I can't think of a better proof of compatibility than these two houses that are being used for support purposes. I mean, if you can't, if you can't, if that's not compatible, if that's not proof of compatibility, I don't know what is. Last point is the conditions, and this is where we are going to disagree with staff on you'all. Have this handout. The top part is the ones, the original staff conditions. We proposed the conditions that you see as a and b for two purposes. One is to say that the services have to be primarily. I know you don't like that word, Mister Salak, but that's the best we could use without keeping that one oak fine run person out of there. Primarily for Oak run. But what else do we do? We limit them to the existing use. These can't be turned into something else. The ones a cable in digital and I did add in similar technology because who knows what we're going to be in 20 years. The other structure for real estate office, limited to the current use, primarily for Oak run. We also added a new paragraph three to restrict the outdoor banners that started all of this. Staff then has proposed, accepted those, but has proposed two new conditions. One of which, paragraph five, we think is probably a good idea. And that is that you, you don't park commercial vehicles in the driveways. And so we're okay with that one. What we're not okay with is a paragraph four, and I'm not certain I understand it, but it looks to me like that we've got to get both building safety department and growth services to say we meet all codes and don't need a change in occupancy thing. And the reason we don't like that is because that opens a pandora's box. There's ten of these. There's three sets here. I'm going to hand out three sets. Chair. So, Jimmy, if you don't mind. So, I mean, those, those buildings weren't meant necessarily. I don't know what they're designed like inside, but they're, they're not meant to be commercial standard, right? I don't know that, commissioner. I don't know that either. So we'll see in a minute where they are not, I'm not certain they weren't, but so do you. But I know this. Okay. They don't current, they don't meet current commercial requirements. That's what we're worried about. It's, you have to, if you have to come in and get a change in occupancy, it's my understanding from talking to my family members in the construction business, you have to meet the current county codes. And I can almost promise you that these buildings aren't going to do that without a whole bunch of expense. What we did. And by the way, got to give the county attorney's office. Dana was here. Dana O. Leski was here. And afterwards she says, did you know there's some building permits that were approved for these things? And some of them appeared to be residential and some appeared to be commercial. I said, no, I should know that, but I didn't. So I looked it up and the material is in your packet. On the deckade digital building, there have been six permits pulled, three for commercial, three for residential. On the real estate office, two commercial and one residential. Now I don't know about the dichotomy, why some of them are residential, some are commercial. But I do want to call your attention to what I'm handing out here now. And David, I need one of those sets. If you could turn to the one that is for the real estate office, you'll see this is a remodel that took place in 1999 when they were, it used to be a design center, just as Priya said, and they were changing it. It says.com m. I'm assuming that's commercial remodel. That one would think that would make sense. But here's what I was intrigued at, was this permit was signed off on not just by the building department, but by the zoning development department and by the zoning department. I don't know what the difference in those was, but you see that the plan review, and presumably the inspection was done by all three of those, as well as by impact fees and by the way there was an impact fee charge, which makes me think that somebody noticed that it was being used for non residential purposes and charge that additional impact fee. But what this shows is that gross services under its previous names should have known what was going on here. Look at the language on the co. This certificate is issued pursuant requirement for just a moment. Now, I don't think that's a fair assumption. Right. Because under the current pud, right. Even if you went for a building code, then at some point we give, because we gave leniency right. To the fact that at some point we expect those buildings to turn back over to residential uses in a pud because we know that they were being used typically in the beginning for marketing or real estate development or picking out your cabinet colors. Right. Right. So when it comes, when it comes now and you officially have to change the designated use, you don't think it has to meet the commercial code? No. And I'll show you why if you let me finish. Because this says that this certificate is issued pursuant the requirements of the Florida building Code, certifying on the date of the final instruction this structure was in compliance with the various ordinances. The Marion county regulating business construction are used for the following. Now, on some of these, it doesn't say what the use is, but if you will look at the air conditioner on the real estate office system for executive office area in this one highlighted. What's the use? Business B. Commissioner Zecx, I'm not saying that the county can't have us back up here and make us amend this pud. I am not saying that. I'm not saying that just because the county knew about this all along that you're somehow a stop from complaining about it. I'm pointing out that they have known that this was a commercial building all this time. They actually held us up to at least some sort of commercial standards on some of these things. And to make us now go back and retrofit the buildings seems a bit unfair, particularly with this language in here. So the condition that's the killer here. If we have to retrofit these buildings, we might as well just move them into the orchid club because it's going to be an expensive undertaking and we've been using them without a problem for 35 years. We're not changing anything. Yeah, but the fundamental problem is today you are. Today, when you change that pud, you change these things to, for all better terms, as Chris has pointed out to commercial, once they change the commercial, they have to meet those rules and regulations. Just like anybody else would, right ca. Because now you're officially saying we're never changing these back. We're never gonna do what the PUD was intended to do is to have these buildings as to be sold back to residential units, right? Yes sir, commissioner. We didn't know that we were violating the code. We thought this was a permitted use for 35. We thought this was a permitted used for 35 years. We came in and got commercial building permits. You don't do that. If you're trying to hide something, you don't tell us. Listen, I don't think anybody was trying to hide anything on either end. Honestly. I don't think our building department was trying to give you some kind of misnr by issuing a permit. I think in all honesty, that today, if we want to change that use and allow them to be commercial, then we're officially changing them. Right? Because all intended purposes was for these",

        "text": " problems we've um I did survey uh residential uh landscapers in uh Portland to see how they've adjusted to these are these are uh electric um they use they use almost entirely electric uh and what are the what are the good things they found what are the what are the bad things they found so I sent out a survey um and that's kind of the results is uh they they all use none of them have those big trucks that have uh uh uh solar panels and then you know there's some big companies that can do that and they charge them as they go but but all of these smaller companies use uh multiple Spar batteries and I went to a webinar and they talked about how really you have to you have to focus on having one company so basically you find a company like steel that you really like um and steel has you know really tough good ratings for commercial use and then you get you can buy all your batteries from them so you can interchange them and you buy all your equipment from them um and then they have warranties in their batteries so they have like a fiveyear warranty so that's about how long you can expect the battery to last um but they all manage the batteries by using 100% multiple spare batteries um so they they expect to use two to three batteries for this job because the batteries only last for an hour or so um they have mostly found the equipments reliable and efficient um they have not really noticed recently uh battery life improving um but you know this is more of a short-term thing um greatest Advantage they had 37% less noise 25% less maintenance um and then the startup cost is the big problem and the thing with the startup cost is that one and a half to two and a half years before you uh basically start getting a return on investment because it's a lot less U maintenance that goes into it um and they're just they last longer than than the the gas power Lea blowers just they just last longer the batteries are not out it's not so so um so the startup cost will take a year and half to two and a half years before you can pay for it but then it starts to be actually more cost effective after that so that's the resource identification and uh the last thing was the pros and cons analysis um and um I'm having a lot of trouble with any kind of financial stuff because I don't understand how the City Works so um he wanted to talk about the uh direct and indirect cost uh impacts to the city so I would need a lot of help of that so I don't really I don't know how that works but the performance of go ahead sorry well so I was goingon to say Debbie in terms of in terms of those cost right I think get as specific as you can right and what that might be is startup costs are big right and like that's that's kind of the the extent we can get um so so that's that's just my guidance to as the committee right get as specific as you can I am not anticipating you're going to have dollars and cents spelled out in terms of um you know the the cost uh to the city um and in the budgetary there yeah so um but the electric costs are the more upfront costs um so you know that's that's we have to make the investment the beginning but the way to work around that I think is it's going to be to phase it in um and to to really focus on replacing as as they as they fail um but as far as performance goes um electric is actually performing as well or better now than gas Consumer Reports has has put out a thing that electric is actually in a lot it depends on the brand you choose but it's in a lot of ways it's uh it's it's it's very powerful and it could do just good of a job the big problem is the batteries um and you're talking you're talking about an hour um maybe two hours of of battery work kind of what they're looking at one of the things to look at when you look at brand names is the American green zone Alliance EXA which is a nonprofit that does uh P robust testing they certify electric products uh for commercial use and they go through there then they certif once they certify them then you you know you kind of know that they're they'll stand up to the abuse of the kind of thing that we find in our parks in our city um and and steel is a big one ego and Makita that they've certified um and um I talked about the return on investment one and half to two and a half years or so but the real Advantage is that electricity is cheaper than fuel um it just it's overall and it's going to and it's going to get cheaper as we turn into more renewable energy um they don't need oil changes they don't need tuneups they don't need any of those things repair costs are are a lot less and they and they operate a lot longer they have a longer operating life so and then the infrastructure is something that I already mentioned um going on to look at um you know how do you bring three batteries out to field and uh where do you charge all these batteries up do we need 220 volt charging so that we have faster charging wherever the wherever they bring their things back to so and just the workflow um is something that would need to change and I just need to know how far we've gotten into that what the experience has been of the how much electrical equipment do we actually have because I I think that letter from um was no no Noy that letter from Noy said that at the time they were looking at trimmers and um and the uh saws the chainsaws we've implemented some stuff us and urban forestry and I think there's something more recent than that but let me let me back so I mean since 200 to is there an inventory like you have inventory of all the small tools yeah I mean I think my recollection of what was sent was how urban forestry the types of equipment they're using how many they have stuff yeah I mean for going evaluate cost in the long term like you have so much you know weed eaters shears all that yeah that I don't I've never seen that if they sent it to JN I didn't get a copy of it but that would be wonderful have excellent well thanks Debbie any other um any other thoughts for Debbie the committee there Juliana go ahead yeah um so the electric costs actually are going up they have been going up there's been like about a 40% increase since 2017 we're going to continue to see that as we uh get our PGE grid cleaner um Salem electrics grid is continuing to stay a little bit below uh the price of PGE so something that could be considered is if there's a way to charge in Salem electric grid so uh basically Riverfront over to West Salem and then a couple places in North Salem uh it we could look at something like that it could help so it might also be considering where we'd have uh cheaper electricity to charge at okay unless it would well you have somebody has to drive clear across town to charge their batteries and stuff and you have efficiency issues and you know running from across town to do that so I think those are just all things that yeah what about a really long extension cord yeah exactly work no it's good thought thanks stebie for that discussion U villan I know I saw you you need to hop out so thanks for coming in and chatting um here Zachary needs to hang off too and so that will uh end our Quorum um and so that's uh fine we got through the Committees that are here um Zachary I think given Woody has stepped away uh is no longer on the board um if you can maybe we can plan on having you join Allan um and his uh committee um and and make that connection um to help fill that spot and give Allen somebody to help work with but see you dlan go ahead and Hop Off Thanks staff thanks everyone appreciate itk you yeah no I was gonna suggest that Mark uh we got a bunch of input on the on Debbie's committee already and Allan and Woody Woody's off of it so I yeah love to make contact with Allan and see where we're at on materials use and capital project stuff and get back to you all cool thank you for that hey thank you for those updates everyone that was really that was really good thank you so much I am gonna hop off though because I do have a meeting with a couple of students here so thank you so much everyone excellent thank you have a good afternoon uh and we'll go ahead and close out the meeting now that we don't have a quum anymore um thanks all for the discussion uh we did not get around to chatting about um Allen's committee or um uh the neighborhood association Outreach um but uh Rob if I can ask you to maybe send around that schedule um as a reminder to the group again of um the neighborhood associations that we would like folks to reach out to yes does that feel like a advance that that was kind of the primary part of that discussion being on the work session is to see where folks are at on that and remind you all to be doing that and remind myself to be doing that um and so I think Rob if you could just do that via email that might um at least help on that front a little excellent I don't think I can ask you but I'm going to anything else for the good of the order before any other discussion items okay thank you all for participating sorry I did not come to see you uh in person today um hope you all have a good rest of your Tuesday",

        "text": " The upper Florida is really what they're looking at. I know St. John's is actually being a little more restrictive than Swissmod or southwest Florida in all cases, at least to date. So, again, to answer your specific question, in and around that, I know they're going to promote over time, and I think with the couch going to play a bigger and bigger role as we move forward in developing alternative water supplies, because when they do that, they can then split that cost between all members associated with that authority and, of course, make water a little more affordable. And I think that's what we're going to see happen. That's what's happened with the other authorities throughout the state. And I just, you know, right now we're in that young stage with that authority. I think you'll see that occur. And then, of course, with Swift Mud's help, they'll focus on that accordingly. Yeah, it's just always one of those interesting things that we're, you know, either swift Mudd or St. John's because of their overarching issues with the larger cities like Tampa or Jacksonville, we get lumped in half and half on each one of those sides. And, you know, we're certainly not taxing the aquifer. Not like they are, not like any of them are. Right. And I don't want our citizens to bear the brunt of that. That's correct. And we're going to have a unique challenge moving forward. You know, and it's going to happen sooner than later, is we're going to actually have an interconnect between St. John's and swiftly. So we're going to have to kind of deal with that because that's going to be new for them that when we interconnect water, now we have water basically flowing between the two districts. That's coming. That's coming very soon. What's that projected timeline, Jodie? I'd definitely say within the next five years. Really? Yes, ma'am. Because we are moving forward. We have the 16 inch proposed right now from irish acres to the shores, which then interconnects us all the way down to what we're building utopia. And then we're going to have our pipeline crossing for Bucky's here soon across 75. Now all of a sudden, everything starts getting closer and closer. All I have to do is make that connection on 326 and we're interconnected. Boom, it's there. It's there. Which, I mean, at that point in time, would it be viable for us to consider looking to the legislature to give us one district versus splittiness? I don't know. I'd have to do a little bit of research on that. I think Jody could pump water one way and tell them. It's one thing, and then you can pump the water back the other way on a different date and tell them something else. And it also gives us two different agencies for grant applications and things like that. I'm not sure if they would want to do that. That's a good point. That's a good point. I just want to make sure we're nothing. It's something we're going to have to work with, with staff, with them. And I think it's workable. Don't get me wrong on that. It's just something we're going to have to be creative. Well, if they were consistent, would their management policies may help as well? So, I mean, that may be then what we petition for. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Anything else on this one? If not, thank you, sir. We appreciate all the good work all of you and your team do. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Only one. It'll be short, no? Yeah. He took his father. He told me he quits. He'll be back and we're going to move on into growth services. All right. Good afternoon. Good to be here. Chuck Farron, director of growth services and also Ken Grey Rock, our brilliant deputy director. So we're going to talk a little bit about today, how do we want growth services to look over the next five years? So, and of course, you know, I'm new, so there's been a team that's really looked at it just to touch a little bit on the process. So, you know, when we started this, I think I've been here for four months or something. So there's was a team of us that's, that's really kind of spoken into this process, into this plan. So we're looking forward to hearing from you, from the team. What's that? We're looking forward to hearing from you on behalf of the team. Absolutely. All right. So starting a little bit high level for the mission for growth service. What we came up with was a simple but broad idea that also helps compliment and complete the overall mission for, for the county. So our idea for the mission for growth services is that we want to guide existing and future development to continually improve the quality of life for Marion county residents. And if we do this, we think that we're going to be helping strengthen the county's position as an ideal place to live, work and play. And then we also looked at, like, what are some values, what are some pillars that we want to help guide our decisions, but then also our interactions and what do we want to be known for, in a sense. And so we came up with the values behind the ideal team player, the humble, hungry and smart. And these are things that we really are. Passionate, not just platitudes. It really is something that we want to get into our water system. And I can talk a lot about it, but I don't want to drill down too much in it unless you want to. But it's things that, as we develop our culture, like things like psychological safety, that people feel comfortable being wrong or expressing ideas and not worrying about getting their head chopped off, so to speak. So developing those things and then also celebrating, I always think that you get more of what you celebrate. So celebrate finding people doing things right. And so those are simple ways that we can help get these kind of pillars, this humble, hungry and smart, into the water system. And of course, it doesn't happen overnight, but it just cracks me up when you said into the water system after we've been talking. Right, sorry. I love that. And then just a little bit on, of course, our organizational chart. This is our current organizational chart. We have implemented three major two matrix in the last few months. And I think this is just important to note for our future because I think this is really going to help drive growth and development of our staff, which then in turn is not a fix all, but helps with retention and growth. So, like, if I'm a, if I start off as a code or zoning tech, and, you know, I want to become a senior planner, like, there's a known path that I can go through. I know the stages, I know the steps, I know the timeframe, all that to get to that path if I want to. So I think, you know, that's important. I don't have to wait for somebody to retire or pass away or something like that. Like, there's a known path for growth. A couple other things to note here. There's twelve code officers reporting to Miss Robin, who's amazing, but at the same time, you know, twelve, you know, something that'll come up in the future, you know, when we look at the future state, twelve code officers, probably a little much. Also, you know, Robin's retiring in August of 2028, and she's also, by the way, doing a lot of it work for the EPL system, for code enforcement. So she's wearing multiple hats. So something that we need to kind of look at a little bit as we look at the future for code enforcement. And then one thing to note here, too, is we have seven zoning texts, which kind of speaks into the next slide. And this highlights, like, the number of interactions that growth services has withdeveloped a, with the surrounding community. And so just to kind of orient us a little bit, the blue is the code enforcement. These are total touch points, like emails, walk ins, phone calls, all that sort of stuff over each fiscal year over the last five years. And so you kind of see on the code enforcement side, I would say it's very resilient. It's not, there's not a lot of fluctuations, not a lot of variance over time. Even what I would call the COVID years, like 2020, 2021, even into 2022, like, there's not a lot of fluctuations there. So it's pretty consistent over time, even if the economy goes up and down. So really consistent there. There's a little bit more variance in our touch points with planning and zoning. So as the economy fluctuates or things, the touch points go up and down. One other thing to note, too, when we add the numbers together in 2023, we're at 112,000 and some change. And that's just slightly above where we're at in 2019, which is when you add the numbers together, it's a little over 109,000, which is a lot of customer service points. Exactly, yeah. And so that kind of speaks. And when we start talking about our vision for the future state, you know, it starts to speak into, like, why customer service is so important. And then we did a swot analysis a little bit, you know, and I always think this is a great tool I've used in the past to help connect our current conditions to our future state. I know the other teams have done this, so I won't go down through each one",

        "text": " specificity in these comments are referenced by my written material that's been previously submitted but um I have not been provided an opportunity to to review the bulk of the material in the post order I do not believe that the limitation on the number of both significant changes that were listed by Oregon Department of energy is inclusive of all the significant changes which we should be reviewed at this point I've heard receipt you've received hundreds of comments from them regarding the Oregon Department of energy and the Idaho Power regarding this application and problems in the first of the protections that although is owned by Idaho Fallen YouTubers active or Page rently by them and simply adding additional justification between support decisions that the focused made is not appropriate in this instance and especially since council did not review those additions to determine if they are in fact active um I actually questioning the college constitution of the economics fields and abilities to review some of this issues being required with you and that's not meant as a any kind of device and statement it's just a statement that I've spent the last 12 years of you at the statutes and I can tell you that I am confident the same that I've been regressed with the statutes rules and Court decisions than any of the council members unfortunately the only member here who probably be present one of the results of these decisions are contemplation will be Henley Jenkins but the rest of you will know about being gone from the council because this is going to impact many many years of um in all of the instances when site certificates were approved with only a draft plan that is inconsistent with the statute that requires the final draft plan I mean included with the site certificate and meeting times where the plan does not fully implement the requirements of the rule does that certificate is actually authorizing a site of certificate absent a proponents of evidence that the development does meet the standard and that standard is required to be determined by the council I know that Odo keeps referencing the fact that councils will referring has no requirements to Odo um it's legislature is intended to allow Otto to make the eligibility decisions when students whether it's occur in its final plans are not in final form of sex certificate division issue then the council is abdicating the decision I think regarding the meeting of the standard which is concerned to state law some of the specific arguments um regarding the naturally important case related to this plan issue is gold versus Students County with the state stated that the times must be in final form and there must be a right to full public participation in those plans if you will notice these things like destroyed properties where the plan is not finalized it does not include impacts or science-specific mitigation that is to inconsistent requirements of the rules of the statutes and when it comes to uh anyway for fire for public services condition 2 for multiple instances any instance where the final plan is natural uh a preponderance evident that shows that the standard is being met the council is delegating Authority illegally uh based on strategies and um they would remove their change the rules that say the council is the party who must make the determination is badminton to calculate uh send that to your with the font the arguments have all been related to only in part but the statute or rule um Idol powered or doe keep talking about the fact that uh the council was founded the applicant has a reasonable uh likely have been obtaining a bonder that are potentially about satisfactory to the council but they have made the rest of the sentence which is to restore the site to a youthful non-nazardous condition so my question is is the council willing to swear that one dollar bond amount is an amount that you believe is adequate to Historic disciple who's not as investigation because certainly that's going to be a question that will be apprehensive identified don't change the uh the bond requirement um the in terms of enormous rules um the noise levels are broken down to the extent that none of the issues can be fully covered the courts have said that uh in contest with cases reduce the scope of the contestants issue cannot be so narrative excludes arguments related to Industry which is what through multiple times interests in these fantastic decisions um also for the noise rules this the statute says the environmental uh the Department of Environmental Quality is required by Statute to determine the equipment the location of monitoring methodology interpretation of results there is no documentation limitations that the methods location interpretation of results that were used by um Eiffel power and approved by Odo actually they are consistent with that statue and in review of the Court Court decisions there are multiple locations that state that uh no agency has the authority to interpret the rules of another agency they have their independence when it comes to interpretation of the rules and standard statutes we really propagated by that agency and even that has limitations on it because for instance is definitely growth has to be defined it has to not be cleared what the statutory will be saying and so uh there are more than one piece of what the Ordinance Department should not be recommending changes to other agency um let's see oh on noise another thing is fabric row of providing things document that uh from the legislature which specifically says that the noise rules do not preclude the opportunity for the Republic to file civil action against um people who are exposing your energy or to excess noise so my question is there are going to be people among that 41 who will be from what I can tell who have an intent to file uh for damages based on noise and the question that hopefully your legal counsel will answer is does your authorization of a perception and a of today's rules meaning that Idaho Power is no longer liable for the damages does that mean that the state of Oregon is personally racist as an agency responsible for these impacts when the citizens actually do file for civil so I would think you'd want to concern that but the last exception um let's see the other thing is on Fourth definition I provided but you haven't seen um I'm filing with the Oregon the land lcdc uh a public complaint and requirements that lcdc deal with Union towns failure to apply the state laws regarding uh definition of forest land you'll see that as an appeal here you I also in questioning because there are owners of forested land use where it's being called agricultural land where mediation is not going to be consistent with what it should be who will be the recipient of litigation when Property Owners say that because of decisions that Odo and exact names who allow the developer to call for us to let agricultural land not deal with um with the rules regarding Forest land yes who's gonna be three someone's going to be seen um anyway I I encourage you to read my generation with us uh it's clear that who wrote studied operating Department of energy have not read yeah or your testimony thank you comments or questions um oh yes in your comment um regarding the material that uh Mr bro provided that doesn't include uh right with the 41 from from challenging the credits it's not clear to me why would you believe the state of Oregon would uh be the responsible idea because the Oregon Department of energy and state of Oregon have are proposing that they have an exemption from Eiffel powered leading the requirements of the Oregon statutes who live inside regarding noise generation so if the state has allowed that this Inception then who would be the target of of given that the legislature has said that the Nationals have no impact on the fact that citizens can't file civil action when their heart supposed to do what's both stand so I'm guessing the overall power is going to argue that although is responsible for this because I knew a lot of them to do it so why should they be held accountable for the outcome that's the thinking that I would think you would not legal any other questions okay thank you Miss Gilbert so Mr secretary is there anyone else in the room they'd like to come for the record my name is Jocelyn Pease and I'm here today on behalf of Idaho Power Company um I'd like to begin by first noting that Idaho Power does not have any um opposition to the material changes that were included with the draft final order um would like to also recognize the hard work that the council photo and all of the review agencies have been into this project for the past 10 years um there's been a lot of recent focus in this new testification presuming um sorry it's been a lot of recent focus on the case proceeding from the ultimate that proceeding um but I'd like to also emphasize the b2h project has a long history even before the congestive case began Ms Gilbert has shared some comments about whatever not necessarily having technical expertise um in connection with all of the subjects rather that the application might address but I don't also know that there have been many rounds of the review review request for additional information and collaborative work with Odo and the review of the agencies that contributed to the development of the application for Saint certificate it has taken a considerable amount of time and resources and hard work to get to this point and Oda Oklahoma through state and local reviewing agencies have spent countless hours reviewing the exhibits to the application for site certificate and participating in meetings to review about the analysis and those amendments and the related construction and mitigation plans uh Ms Gilbert had commented that some of those mitigation plans um are in draft form and will be finalized and that approach is consistent with the council's rules that and in most cases the draft plan includes and process at the front end for finalizing and vetting those plans with the agencies and that's all to say that through this through this effort through this um years-long process Odo and the reviewing agencies provided an important feedback that substantively contributed to the plans that are included um as the attachments to the draft final I'd also like to recognize the involvement of the participants in the contested case proceeding The Limited parties that objected to certain elements of the proposed order and had the opportunity to waste their concerns within the contested case process during the course of the two year long contested case Idaho powered Auto further analyzed the contested case of issues raised by the Limited parties and were warranted provided additional analysis and revised condition of plan language as just one example among many um for the recreation analysis The Limited parties that have raised concerns about potential impacts of Americans that Morgan link Park in response to those concerns Idaho power provided a supplemental analysis and in fact expanded its proposed mitigation um to use the shorter each rings in that area and that this change is",

        "text": " get the application done a little bit hard to say um if I understand the fsec process correctly there should be a micro siding part of this feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but uh the battery itself especially nowadays it's very volatile to choose one in the sense that you know things the technology is always uh changing very rapidly so if we're looking at a project that's helping to start construction in the latter half of 2025 and come online at the end of 2026 to lock in the specific type of panel and technology in in 2023 is pretty far out so we would like to request some flexibility when it comes to specific modules and specific battery type until we're a little bit closer to construction and when we can actually secure all the equipment needed so you wouldn't actually be locking yourself into using the panels from the Georgia plant that's pretty much our biggest Advantage so we would most likely be going with Q cells technology when it comes to panels and this is Todd corner from the Oregon Department of energy I'll respond to that a little bit so typically because the time frames are you know somewhat far out in terms of the application submittal to the point in time where projects get approved and ultimately constructed we do not lock specific Technologies and so our process is meant to look at the like the sort of the The Proposal what are the impacts of that um but if the panel is the same size the dimensions you know we've looked at all the same information we don't lock it into a specific same thing with the battery storage now if if ultimately something gets approved and the applicant comes in or at that point you know they're they're the certificate holder come in and want to do something very different and we haven't done a proper evaluation that would require an amendment but that's typical with win facilities and solar facilities because there is so much change in technology we do not lock into a very specific in this case uh battery storage or solar type of see in the industry as I understand it is that things are so back ordered you sort of have to order the stuff 10 years in advance so you're almost required by the market to pick your technology you know on the same time scale as you're making the application so you'll actually have to have the stuff when you want to start building so that that would provide a basis for you know allowing technology changes at the last minute but um let me move on try to cover some other things that maybe haven't been covered before another aspect of the notice that's sort of vague is the business about whether their socials are going to be fixed or whether they're going to be on some access that rotates and be associated with a whole lot of machinery and gears and gearboxes moving them around will the fsec at least require them to figure that out before the you know in the application process yeah so for ours you know they other solar projects have either come in and said that they're going to be fixed or um typically what happens is the the applicants submit something bigger than they actually could produce just to make sure that they give them flexibility so um again I'll let the applicant kind of respond to that but you know if they have some option where it could be fixed or it could be on an axis and rotating they would likely submit the kind of the rotational version because that's more significant and then later on if it makes sense for them to do the lesser build a lesser kind of components they would do that rather than vice versa submitting something lesser and then having to go through an amendment process with us so I'm just anticipating that but I'll let the applicant um kind of respond that's what we've seen in in Prior applications and this this is Paul Hicks again with Tetra Tech um one of the things that would be included in the analysis is it's you know at this state proposed to provide some flexibility as those choices need to get made so what we'll look at is like let's take example an analysis of like glare uh for you know potential glare for a facility we would look at that differently in the modeling for like a fixed tilt as opposed to one that's rotating on single access so the analysis would be able to contemplate and take into account both um if if those options need to be maintained open or if you know the applicant chooses um that they want to go with just one or the other that's what would be reflected in the actual application when that's when that's prepared to add to that at Q cell is when we're designing projects we're our standard is to go with bifacial modules uh with single axis trackers the reason why we wrote in the noi uh whether like you know to accommodate for whether it's fixed tilt or uh single single access tracker it's again for flexibility uh we're not typically that before areas that have challenging topography or there might be some other site constraints that make us might need to actually have some sections or if not the whole entire thing fixed tilt but our standard is to go with uh bifacial uh modules and a single axis tracker because it's our most efficient setup thank you that's helpful um there were some suggestions in the notice that there wasn't really any uh water use at all how do you keep them without water the panels don't need to be cooled I'd say about pooling it's about cleaning you know it's a flyover the birds do what they do on them the dust from the Sheep you'll have a material reduction output if you don't clean them for 20 years right sorry I I miss my misheard so for cleaning it kind of um we would most likely contract with an operation maintenance for someone for panel washing that's more familiar with Oregon State in this area um and then that would dictate how often uh the panels need to be washed just with the precipitation in this area we expect it to not be that often but I I can't say for certain for this project but just to put that for context for other parts that uh in the US that we've developed projects uh module washing could happen once a quarter it could happen just once a year it kind of depends on the conditions is there have there been any or what percentage of the the land is going to become impermeable so so to speak in terms of runoff patterns if you build this these large impermeable surfaces you'll get this sort of flashier runoff that that spikier and it has a different character than just rain falling on grass is there is there work done to examine the effects of that on things like erosion and this is Paul Hicks with Tetra Tech um storm water management erosion um I don't you know we don't have the details right now but those are things that will definitely be addressed in the application for site certificate with some rigor um so um that is something you can will definitely be expected to take into account you know what what areas are impervious versus what what are not and how will storm water runoff be treated on site and I guess this is a question for fsec you're going to do this sort of preliminary order which is going to govern the application in some sense is it appropriate for oh will you be putting in conditions in your order that make sure that a lot of the things we've been talking about tonight are going to be covered in an adequate way uh getting back to the project order again that's the essentially the laundry list of what the applicant has to submit in their application so we don't it's not really conditions it's a requirement so you know again based upon comments that we receive from you know the public tonight from you know the Lynn County from State agencies tribal governments we will then use that information to determine you know what particularly for this project in this location they have to submit as part of their application um so it's not really a condition but it is a requirement um in terms of what we ultimately conclude that they have to to provide on the record I understand the public comment period is closing on August 11th when do you anticipate the project order coming out uh project order uh we have 140 days to get the project order out so I think that's uh early um something like October 6th would be the latest date you share drafts of the project order with the applicant or with the public no so basically come August 11th it go you'll go into a black hole and not talk to them and not talk to us and emerge with the project order later or will there be an ongoing consultations with other agencies sometimes well it's not how I would characterize it um that's exactly what we're doing here is we're seeking your input to help us evaluate what needs to be in the application uh it will definitely work with reviewing agencies Again State agencies local governments tribal governments to help determine what goes in there so you can find that hearing a clear answer I I understand the process now I guess my question is when August 11th happens and you guys it's you're sitting down to do the project order are there other stakeholders who are allowed to comment on the project order besides the well nobody comments on the project order so they comment on the notice of intent which is what we're doing here project order establishes what the applicant has to submit in their application and then once the application is complete and then we issue the draft proposed order essentially our findings on whether we staff believe they have mental requirements or not then we'll open it up for another public comment period let me try this one more time and then I'll have mercy on everyone and stop are you going to share graphs of the project order with other state agencies we seek their input and we want to make sure that we have the information correctly so we seek their comments and if we have need clarification you know we will you know for lack of a better terminology we don't share a draft with them but we get their permit requirements and make sure that we have that correct so I think it's essentially the same thing that you're asking but it's maybe in a different context okay so I've taken up on this time and it's getting late so thank you very much and we'll be presenting our written comments thank you uh next is Bill Royal Bill are you there Bill your your mic is open uh seems like you're typing but if you want to provide an oral comment you are certainly allowed to do that can you hear me now yes we can hear you now okay I super apologize I don't know why that was a problem but sorry can you can we",

out to agencies as as much as possible but having said that one of the things we found in Tigger is we don't track a lot of this stuff it was hard to get information on a lot of this stuff so it there there's going to be times where we're going we need to be tracking this and nobody's tracking it somebody needs to track it part of it uh Colin so you're on mute all right how about now perfect all right great I think it'd be double needed Every Time We join these meetings um yeah thanks for the the chance to comment here on this I I just want to express from DEQ standpoint uh we we really appreciate this recommendation and the and the concept and hope to see it to fruition um we have two different ways of our agency uh measures uh greenhouse gas emissions you know the traditional sector-based inventory that the commission has so often used and reported out on the legislature as well as the consumption-based uh lens that we've and so pairing this with the recommendation in under four to continue to update that second uh and look or lens along with additional ones such as uh sequestration or emissions from the actual working lands uh we think it's great to be able to provide really amplify those existing to lenses that our agency reports out on regularly for the sector-based approach irregularly but hopefully regularly in the future for consumption and pairing that with additional ways to look at Oregon's uh climate footprint we think it's a really great idea and happy to to um Odo and the commission uh develop just wanted to express our support on this one great thank you so much Colin I really like that phraseology that amplifies what's already going on that's a good way to put it Colin uh Gabriella did you have your hand up um first uh thank you appreciate and and um support the inclusion of OHA as a named agency uh in B and then I'm sorry yeah movie and then in C I just wanted to ask about the local government um you know thinking about climate-friendly and Equitable rules thinking about um you know resources that are going to be tapped and coming to local governments you know if there's just one is that you know one just for Association of counties to pick and and not League of cities the Oregon cities is that Urban versus rural large versus small and you know we have this in a lot of different um contexts where they're uh you know maybe it's just two and with some you know one rural one Urban or something like that but I guess just flagging that it's going to be you know more and more important as as they are resourced to do this work and required to do this work how do you get them at the table in a way that really um engages them and makes it meaningful for local governments so I was just wondering about having just one yeah that's a good question I think the thing we might want to change is the six members who are representing um who are in named seats are supposed to be have experience local government experience which is a little different than uh representative um I think uh although um maybe to be consistent because we're also using representative above um trying to to leave it as representative I think your points well our governments are very different across the state and local governments to local government representatives to try and address that and get some these uh the way that our current voting numbers are determined um it's a it's a governor decision and so that would we would that this would follow that pathway I think any thoughts on um Gabriella's recommendation that we maybe think a little more broadly about how to engage local government expertise on the commission I'm not seeing any chair McDonald I would just comment that that I represent a you know a rural County and and I'm familiar with the local needs and and local government so I so in a way we're already doing good point yes our commissioners have wear several hats and and bring several different yeah I really I did that as well I'm us I'm on the city council in the city of Dundee and and so I do look through that lens as well um at these issues but um but yeah I mean having someone specifically for local government as um I I would support the the basic I am mindful of how big our commission already is that's the one you know concern that I have as we start talking about making you know adding more and more people and we kind of found a way to do that by without expanding it too significantly but I think we just need to be a little careful on that any other reaction to the name modification of C uh Gabriella with the comments from commissioner Reedman and Ford Commissioners Reitman and Ford are are you comfortable with the notion of it just being one you know um I I wouldn't Express that too I just I was thinking just a practical method adding one local government representative could attract questions uh about that and so it may be that the point is that you you don't need that maybe um because you are already looking for that in in other Commissioners but bringing that perspective um you know it was really more kind of a when you if you the Practical effect of just saying you'll have one local government representative and what will that yeah what will that seat do if the and very mindful of not wanting to have such an unwieldy size so if the appointments are happening cognizant of needing to get those kind of perspectives on there already maybe maybe you don't need one more representative but so not certainly not opposed to appointing one it was more a yeah a good I think it's a good point okay can you comment in the chat around you know possibly someone from League of cities or Association of counties that could help address the concern you raised Gabriella and I'm also wondering if um given the conversation and considerations we just talked about rather than a standalone representative it could be a greater intention around Outreach and and making local government Representatives aware of global warming processes and conversations and just so there's some um again more intentional Outreach and communication around those opportunities to weigh in um because I think part of it is just making sure that there's awareness um and given we can't have representatives from you know every um uh local government body maybe that's that's a way to address the need here well if you went with AOC and loc it maybe that's uh I don't know how they would feel or if this president for them being ex-officio non-voting members those those organizations would bring the perspective of their membership more and remember that voting members are all appointed by the governor so in essence you can punt us over to the governor and Lobby for that appointment taking into consideration you know there's only you know 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions come from Transportation there's one yeah yeah that's right it was just raising a thought not not a big no it's a good point um and we could definitely think about it on the non-voting side um we you know recommendation 5B is adding a lot of new state agencies to the commission and some of those that are currently in we have a set of three um non-voting at large members that we can appoint from either other agencies or Academia maybe that would be a way for us to include local governments if we put that over on the non-voting side either and then maybe reduce some of the at Large non-voting members I'd like to give that a little more chair McDonald just one other thought we it should be incumbent upon the governor to appoint people who who aren't just one issue or one organization or one represent the diversity of the state absolutely pretty good point uh any concerns about taking the local government out of the voting membership list and putting it into the non-voting membership list it's here McDonald I would just want to check this statue because I think it might say ex-officio meaning the office of the director for at least the state agencies and we just need to make sure that um that works but uh just a technical question yeah good point Zach and any other comments on recommendation then let's go to I assume they're probably well let's go to recommendation six just to wrap things up any questions or comments on the change uh which Zach had highlighted which was just to make sure we were reflecting the fact that the federal funding from the IRA and iija is also directed at natural and working lands well with that um we are a little bit behind time um we uh have but we do have time for public comment uh Linda do you have a sense of how many people have signed up for public comments we have two people signed up for public comment um Angus Duncan and Linda Craig and if anybody else wants to uh make sure let uh Linda know and we got on I think Eric Street has ended up in the in the attendees list so there's okay great and if you can try and uh keep your comments to a couple of uh we would appreciate it I will start with Angus welcome Angus commission members and chair McDonald uh I assume that you can hear me unless you're waving at me and telling me you're not but we can hear you a little faint huh well that's probably just my retiring what what you what you mostly don't need from a a former member and chair is her regular you know critiques uh and so I've tried to keep my participation in your processes to a minimum but I follow them carefully and I would just start out by saying I'm extremely gratified by two things I commission has done recently one is the natural working lands recommendations um and the second which you are taking action on I hope today is uh is modifying the the state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals would note that when we originally developed these goals back 20 years ago um we set a 2050 goal of at least 75 um that was reflecting the fact that neither we nor the world scientists knew exactly what 2050 ought to look like and we have a much better sense for it now and and so I appreciate your revising uh that 2050 goal in particular up upwards and inserting you know an additional intermediate goal so those are the those are the things I really like um the concerns I have and the written comment that I submitted has to do with the the",

        "text": "regon just recently and all those studies modeled the ways that the states could meet their clean energy standards but they were all of the the sort of options were predicated on the on the existence of a regional market so we don't have um an analysis right now other than the state-led study which is not on a really a a very fine-tuned state by state basis that shows us uh you know how or what the challenges to meeting those clean energy standards without a regional market would be um because all the assumptions have been that there would be one in place so just to point that out thank you nicole looking for other hands raised here everyone's gotten shy after our 10-minute break uh there we go uh ben and then mary so i just want to kind of point out in our draft power plan we do definitely item calling for more research on siding i think one of the things most people don't realize about the northwest power act is it set up a system where it comes to hydro or we have kind of protected waterways that are universal throughout the columbia river basin so i guess one of the advantages that you might say an rtl would have is you could come up with a consistent approach sort of like that for sighting where you can look at what are the underlying sort of considerations that need to be made come up with areas that that are sensitive and and it's something that we've flagged in our power plan and something that that while it's out for comment right now not final that we're still definitely considering as kind of a an effort that needs more thought and more research and so i again don't know that this is an rto specific item um but i do think that there's not a universal approach to how these things are handled right now and an rto naturally creates a centralized structure where you could probably have a more universal or more consistent approach at least to something like this on on environmental impacts and and any sort of signing considerations of course not taking away the fact that each state has its own citing concerns and and its own thoughts and and and we particularly called out the fact that it's not a site-by-site sort of consideration it's more of a kind of aggregated consideration you're talking about wind in the gorge each site was evaluated individually but the overall scope of it together is harder to kind of put your arms around and so just kind of flagging that it is something that we've had conversations about um obviously with with multiple states and multiple entities that are concerned about it and and i think it's something carefully approached an rto again it could be a platform to help you get but it's not necessarily innate in the fact that you'd form an rto that you would have some approach to thank you ben mary thank you just a couple of comments i think that actually dovetail well on what ben was just saying you know i think in terms of sort of emission reductions in the way that i think of this and i think the way you probably many utilities think of it is i think we maybe just lost your audio there mary i'm sorry my back your mac yes okay uh you know really thinking about what utilities need to do or what needs to happen in order to achieve that decarbonized grid and i and i think you really bring in everything that we've already talked about today you're talking about utilizing the existing system more efficiently as well as building new transmission you're talking about new types of technology that can be integrated to you know get through the periods of time when you don't have renewable generation and then also more getting more renewables on the system more efficiently and so i think from from our perspective an rto can really provide some benefit in terms of enabling those things to happen more cost effectively and more quickly but i don't think the rto in and of reduces emissions as it were you know sort of operating the market sort of market rules themselves aren't necessarily designed to reduce ghg-specific ghg emissions specifically i think it's i think the idea is to operate the system more effectively and enable that decarbonization to happen more efficiently more cost effectively i will say that there are some state policies that would need to be considered in terms of how the dispatch works and you know for instance california has a carbon price if california was you know participating in the rto and washington has a current will have a carbon price as well those state policies will need to be reflected in the market rules in some fashion but i think an rto just sort of by itself doesn't necessarily accomplish um emission reduction um the other point i wanted to make too that it's related to this again and sort of um thinking about what what benefits an rto can really provide beyond kind of what we have today and i and i think an existing issue that we have today is this sort of ghg accounting question and and i think that issue continues regardless of rto or not um in terms of how are states able to um look at you know whether or not they're meeting their goals what are the accounting tools you're really using not goals policy required policies what what are states really using to verify that those policies are being met i think that issue exists with or without nrto i think the benefit of an rto is really a common platform to start with to figure out what what what kind of tracking system or what kind of i don't even really like tracking system what kind of accounting system are we all collectively going to use to account for the different state policies and i think that's really important because right now we don't we don't have kind of that common platform to come together and decide a way to do it and when you have different states adopting different approaches you end up with conflicts between states in terms of how they're accounting for the same energy so i really think that it's not so much that an rto itself does uh but i think the rto framework can you know states to come together and adopt to come in a common framework across the rto footprint in terms of how to allocate and account for energy and emissions thank you mary i want to go next to thanks adam uh and apologies if you can hear my uh washer rattling in the background um but uh as no surprise to anyone i really want to address the discussion question related to equity environmental justice and i think going back to something mary i don't think either ghg impacts or equity and environmental justice are inherent to the formation of an rto it really comes down to how that happens what principles and values are taken into account and how that informs the structural development um and i think it's worth knowing almost that this is not just an issue for oregon um but an issue that would have to be internalized with agreements amongst other states who would be involved in an rto formation whether it's a northwest option or whether uh oregon chooses to join california so i think we really have to think about what are the values and principles that we as a state want to see uh play out um what are the goals that we have and where are they shared with other entities who might participate in uh in a market or organizational formation uh as to equity and environmental justice specifically um i think we talked in our last meeting and i think it was nicole who raised the idea of some sort of advisory body um and i think we really uh strongly endorse that idea of the governance an important place for equity and environmental justice are considered and i think it plays out in two ways one is directly for communities and we talked a little bit about the citing issues that potentially come up making sure that an rto doesn't have unintended impacts or burdens for communities associated with increased demand in different ways um some accountability for market participants i think will be really important that to enter into the market uh you have to adhere to certain values or principles related to equity or environmental justice with the projects and they shouldn't be in some sort of contention with community i think would be a really important thing from from our perspective but then actually having a body that's built into the governance that can uh support um just evaluation of market participants of market structure and make sure things are working in ways and also be responsive as kind of an oms buds entity to community concerns that might come up that's one entity that can deal with environmental justice communities broadly but i think i raised in our last conversation as well the importance of figuring out how to address sovereign nations um tribal governments specifically within uh an rto and the fact that sovereign nations are part of the region but have their own governmental interests some of them develop their own renewable energy projects some of them have their own utilities and so that will be a really important consideration into rto formation is any government that is hoping to engage at state in an rto will have to i think have really good consultation with the tribes within the current borders of the state but then also a broader rto formation needs to have some seat at the table for all tribes who who might have land or energy resources that might impact that rto and there should be special considerations given to valuing resources to build wealth for for tribal around projects and also making sure that citing doesn't impact cultural and historical resources that that increased demand doesn't have a negative effect in that way so i think governance is really and a way to address this issue and then i think the last point i'll make is just that first sentence about rto shouldn't be evaluated as a tool to solve all the industries problems i think there are ways we can replicate problems in the and there are ways that we can acknowledge those problems or opportunities and use an rto to make some course corrections and i think that can happen on a couple of fronts one is really valuing ders and community-based resources um we might not necessarily have requirements around utilities to procure those resources uh in in the fullest extent that that might be valuable from an environmental justice perspective but there may be ways in an rto that you could really think about valuing ders valuing community based projects and establishing those wealth building opportunities it's also worth noting that utilities um in addition to developers stand to really benefit from an rto and potentially have a particular benefit for their shareholders i think we need to think about how to create some equity in that front and make sure the benefits flow to but also",

        "text": " the the line that are in Washington um will also be subject to review by the Washington half staff um and then the entire projects also subject to Federal review by the Army Corps of engineer in other next slide please so since we're talking about special Advisory Group appointments I did just want to give some detail of uh where the line crosses uh through local jurisdictions in general in Oregon the wine is in Wasco Hood River and Multnomah counties and then uh six other cities this map shows where the wine passes through the city limits of the dowels as you can see uh the line connects the spaghetti which is that green square on the right hand side of the image uh kind of winds down the BPA complex and then follows Highway 197 up into the city of The Dalles it then passes along the rights of way of Highway 30 and East 2nd Street and then would enter the River via horizontal drilling near the Dallas Marina this uh so yeah you can see there that it then exit into the portions of the river that are within Wasco County and next slide please um this one I just kind of want to illustrate uh the city of equipments of the city of Mosher are shown in red here and this is one place where the proposed alignment as it is proposed now would not actually be located within the city limits of the city of Moser but the site boundary does include a portion of uh their jurisdiction that's within the um and so that's why they're included on this list um I will say the city of Mosher has asked for some more information on whether or not they'll be affected and we will expect to see that into full um next slide please okay uh this shows city of Hood River uh again uh the both the site boundary and the proposed alignment as it is now what would cross over uh Waters within the the city limits of the city of Hood uh but none of the lands would be affected next slide please okay and um here's again the city of cascade box a small piece of the site boundary overlaps with the city limits you can also see that this is the segment that would cross over uh into Washington and be located uh on land and that's to avoid the the walk and dams uh shown um towards the middle left of this slide next slide please the from from the last Slide the line travels through unincorporated Multnomah County uh and this shows where it enters into the kind of East Portland metro um the wine and the site boundary would include portions of the river that are within the city limits of the city of Fairview I did want to show that uh the Gresham and uh Troutdale City Limits are also adjacent um but are not included within the site um so so as a result those two cities are not we're not recommending those to be appointed as special advisory groups okay and then this is the final map if you could go to the West slide or next slide please great and this is uh the city of Portland um you can see that the line is proposed to uh cut through Hayden Island at about the Midway Point um on some property that's owned by the port one and some other properties uh it would be trenched across the island and then installed using HDD underneath the Portland the north Portland Harbor um and then would be installed in the right-of-way of North Marine Drive uh to the converter station site which is shown again in green um from there it would be installed under the I think that's the Ramsey Wetlands uh and would travel through North Portland uh in trenches and Road rights away to the Willamette River where it would again go into HDD go under the river and that area of the river is a super fun site so they have used HDD to try to avoid disturbing sediments there um and then pop out on the other side and connect with the hardwoods and I'm gonna talk a little bit about the land use approval process and just the review process in general but I did want to pause to see if any of the council members had any questions just about the proposed route as it is presented in the does anyone have any questions for Christopher at this time it doesn't sound like anyone has any thank you chair Crow um okay next slide please Nancy great uh so we are at the very beginning of the citing process I know you are all familiar with us but um just to review there's seven major steps in the citing review process uh the notice of intent is the first um at this stage we've received the uh applicants kind of best level review of the project um the in the noi the noi is posted to the project page um we this this stage involves giving public notice to the public um as well as getting notice to State agencies local governments and affected tribal governments um we sent out all of those notices on April 4th and the deadline for comments that we posted is actually today um so if anybody is listening on the audience and still wants to provide comments you can tonight until the end of the day today uh and there is information on how to get those comments to us on the project page for this project and then the next step uh for us oh and I guess I should know that all the comments that we received as of yesterday are available from the citing docket on the the council's webpage I will work on getting the additional comments that have come in today posted right after this meeting okay and then so based on the the comments that we get and and the Department's review of the noi um we will be preparing a project order which essentially provides a list of all the standards and legal requirements and study apply requirements that the applicant must address in their um we are required to get that project out order out towards the end of July um we are still waiting on some comments from some reviewing agencies and some local governments so um is still in progress and and it will be we expect to meet the deadline um but it may be towards the deadline so once we get the project order out um the applicant will be working on their application they probably already are in the Nui the applicant indicates that they intend to submit their application in the spring of 2024 um the but the noi is valid for two years so it could be submitted as late as March of 2025 without an extension okay next slide please Nancy okay again um review for the council members uh the state citing process is a Consolidated review that means that we pull in a lot of uh uh of the review that would normally be conducted by other state agencies as well as local governments um one of the things that get pulls into the council's review is determining whether or not the facility complies with applicable substantive criteria from local governments comprehensive plans and land use ordinances or development codes applicant may elect to either get their land use approval from a local government directly or from the council in this case the applicant has indicated that they intend to seek land use approval from from fsec to sort of facilitate that review process the council is stop statutorily obligated to appoint the governing body of any local government within whose jurisdiction facility is proposed to be located as a special Advisory Group and uh so that is what we are asking you to do today and then when the council does make its decision just just a reminder that that decision is binding on the effect of local governments in that any necessary permits or approvals addressed and decide certificates must be issued upon receipt of the proper form and fees by the local government um Nancy next slide please thank you um great so uh as I mentioned on April 4th we did send out letters uh informing governing bodies that they would be appointed a special uh advisory groups and requesting comments um specifically we asked the local governments to identify any issues of concern that they'd like to see addressed in the application uh to give us recommendations on what the applicable substance criteria might be and uh to let us know what local permits um would be necessary for the facility that would be governed by the site certificate we also asked for recommendations for any necessary studies or uh that they they wanted to see provided as part of the application and the appropriate sizes for analysis areas for impact analyzes um and then just as the slide shows uh that request was just the first opportunity for the special advisory groups to participate in the process we'll send out some more requests during the completeness review and then after the issuance of the draft proposal order um next slide please great so uh with that information um and in accordance with ORS forces 9480 staff recommends that the council designate the governing bodies of each local government within whose jurisdiction the Cascade renewal transmission system is proposed to be located as special advisory groups um the list of the nine local governments or sorry yeah local um that are uh within the site boundary is provided on this slide because there is a separate order for each special Advisory Group we recommend you appoint each through a separate code that unless there's any questions I'll turn it over to you thank you uh one question I have um is if Council you know moves on do we have to do each one individually I see that's how they're listed but I just want to confirm that's our recommendation I would uh defer to Patrick go on whether or not that's necessary I don't think it's necessary but but I'm you know you can see however you like as long as long as long as I think the motion language is set up but as long as who you're appointing that then one motion would be all right okay girl this is Kent yes Kent I'll I'll make a stab at this in in one motion I think I can do it uh so that it'll be fine okay so Madam chair I move that the council appoint the Wasco County Board of Commissioners and the Hood River County Board of Commissioners and the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners and the Dallas City Council and the Moser city council the Hood River City Council and the Cascade lock City Council and the Fairview city council and the Portland City Council as special advisory groups for Council proceedings related to the proposed Cascade renewable transmission system thank you any questions comments on that motion a second for that book yes this is Anne I would second um Vice chair house uh motion thank you counselor uh any further con comments or chair Grail this is Anne buyer again I just um wanted to let folks know that I attended",

meeting for August 8th 2023 completing roll call all right we're here or we're not um we're gonna go uh I guess we have a cast counselor from the council uh nothing in additional what we're going to talk about tonight okay and that's being over profession that'll be great career Improvement there so but nothing new and exciting to do the new uh no not previous okay then we'll move right Into Climate friendly and Equitable communities this is our first topic it's excellent um for those of you that don't know me I'm Joy Chang and I'm the senior planner in our Planning Group so and tonight I'm talking about the climate friendly and Equitable communities next cheese all right so um yeah I tried it and it wasn't moving okay anyway um climate family and Equitable communities also we use the economics defect uh rules were developed by former Governor uh Kate Brown where she issued an executive order in March of 2020 that Titan Oregon's carbon emission goals and director state agencies to take action to speed up the base of emission um lcdc adopted land use building and transportation planning rules for jurisdictions and uh for in Oregon's metropolitan areas in July of 2022 and one of the key things that see your Sherwood and 12 other jurisdiction including Tualatin Hillsborough Happy Valley in Oregon City eventually sued over the new rules and the case is currently in the Oregon court of appeals at issues whether the lcdc exercise Authority it did not have when codifying and mandating the verbs so why are we implementing now since we're still in litigation that's one of the questions that was raised and basically we appealed um and asked for a stay um through the circuit court court of appeals and our stay was denied the court didn't uh weigh in on the mayors of the case at all it simply found that uh irreparable harm has not been shown um basically stating that the harms uh were not immediate and all cities would continue to function so meaning um the regulations continue as far as our enforcement or applications there you go so again CPAC rules uh take in effect incrementally and we'll talk about that momentarily there are some required implementation this year uh EV conduits are required where uh so we can Implement these uh even though they're not codified because they're clear and objective standards and I'll talk to you more about that yeah we as a city are suing lcdc and the state saying that we don't agree that they have implemented legal rules and we are now say that because they're clear and objective we're going to go ahead and apply them um what we're saying is that the ones that are clear and objective that are that were mandated to be in effect at a certain threshold we have to implement and then we did some of the following slides we'll show that we did requests for parking reform be an extension for a whole year for us to do a code audit and things like that so that we can properly implement it but the direction we've received from account or from our city council is that we cannot do anything because our deadline for not doing anything was July uh or June 30th of this year and if we didn't do anything as far as requests for the extension or not implement the Mandate is that we wouldn't be allowed to require parking anywhere in the city yeah so the lawsuit is it's active but the law is still in effect so until we win or lose until we win the lawsuit if we do win the lawsuit then these are the weekend you know we can do away with all of this but while the lawsuit is still in effect still active we have to implement through we have to act like basically there's no lawsuit all of the law applies and we have to implement it and so that's what we're doing okay and then the reason for that is the law I mean basically that that's the that's the status of the law right now it is legal it's law it's legal even though there's an appeal going on it's still in effect and so what Joy was just saying is there's Provisions within the law that says if we don't choose our own path in terms of a you know a b or all these options then the law chooses for us and so we're saying all right we still don't like this but we are going to choose our own destiny within this law um while the lawsuit's being worked out so that language that was articulated there I think it needs to be the first paragraph of every public Outreach because that messaging needs to be clear to the citizens that we are not implementing these items because we just want to implement a rule but if we fail to implement something consequences of that action are that we can't enforce any parking regulations and this is the best approach we have to continue to control what part of our destiny we can let's see that's right yes so I do want to say that um even though this is uh somewhat the first time you guys are seeing it um we did talk to City Council in regards to the direction um in regards to there was all these different options that we'll be um so that we got their guidance in regards to how should we proceed because of the time right I think when we get ready to go to here and if we do some more public Outreach some people are so embedded in it they assume that everybody understands and there's a lot of step back and give yes context context that citizens right um so um yes I'm sorry that's getting the leads but because I get clear and objectives so you can you're not gonna put it in the code now until the outcome of the lawsuit how are we is it just every development will be check shaded yeah yes yep um yeah every application that would be impacted we're going to be treating it differently uh that aspect of it um and then some some form of if and when because one of the key things is for us to do a code audit and make changes but the request has been having some type of a sunset Clause if if we you know these are not in effect kind of they kind of go away um that was going to be my next thing was the conversation of having a sense and Applause yeah that if if we right so again um okay so this year EV conduits and um two parking reforms A and B uh we'll be discussing shortly um and then in the future we have uh designating climate friendly areas uh Transportation performance standards the transportation tsp update requirements again rules provide options for local just to request alternative implementation timeline for certain elements so um which we did ask so let's talk about that so again phase one parking reform a uh in your packet it's like the light purple uh reducing parking mandates that took effect December three years of 2012 June uh and then phase two that took effect June 30th um and again agencies can request extension and I want to let you know we did request it and we did get approved for a one-year extension in regards to parking reform B so dlcd uh granted this we could extend it until a lawsuit was Unfortunately they would only extend it for every jurisdiction within Oregon for a year and once across the board to make it very late what's the we don't have a status on that yeah we we hope it gets resolved by the end of this year there's a chance even if it doesn't get appeal if you can't to the Oregon Supreme Court so it's is the plaintiff League of Oregon cities or is it individual cities it's the individual cities and counties can we ask for a second extension or continual extensions or is it just a one and only well well we requested a one and only and to provide a scope of timing on what is expected within that gear you know like the code audit our public engagement the hearings process so um I don't know we kind of provide we built in a timeline so that we can meet the expectations that we hear and to be honest I don't know if they would Grant another exception to allow more time um but the door may not be closed it's just yeah but I don't know of any other cities asking for it and then we're a little special just because we're one of we're in litigation too so yeah who knows but at the same time I think if we do uh I I would hope that if we're making a good faith effort in looking through budwers somehow delayed due to something major not a covet epidemic but some you know maybe they're not you're not one word um you know maybe they'll reconsider but we have um so so let's just talk about the electric vehicle charging so uh all new multi-family residential buildings with five or more units so that's the case five or more units they need to provide electrical service capacity uh for 40 of their parking spaces capacity just means installing the conduits the pipes to serve the 40 parking uh spots ready for additional wiring charging stations to support EV at the Mark as the market expands so uh EV infrastructure for housing development of four or fewer or other development Banks aren't required so it's very specific to five or more so apartment multi-family um so the only one that I can think of that would be coming is you guys recently heard the zone change for Sherwood Plaza we changed that from a retail commercial to high density residential and the ultimate goal for them is Apartments so that's the only development that at this time that I can see that they would have to apply this I don't know of any other multi-family at this time as far as any pre-ops for any additional oh sorry yeah how many of the actual stations are they going to have to provide if it's only the conduits for the 40 it's just the conduits I mean yeah right they just have to have um they have to build the capacity but it would um benefit the development to actually have at least one or two just because you know but at least um the wiring is available vastly cheaper than trying to retrofit yes yeah it doesn't add a lot really yeah it's it's it's um really smart planning whoever is developing that they just do that just because",

I will turn it over to Robbie and thank him for his virtual presence. Thank you, council president Martin. And this is one of the benefits of having virtual meetings is when allergies hit. You all don't need to hear me sneeze. I can just mute myself. So it works out great. A couple of things I wanted to share with the council tonight. First, I wanted to thank our city manager's office team that is focused on sustainability and resiliency for a great cost saving opportunity for Hillsboro homeowners to install solar panels. Robin Straughan and Daisha Baucom have been working with our partners at Energy Trust of Oregon and Solar Oregon on the Solarise, Hillsboro and Cornelius campaign. Now through April 30, Hillsboro and Cornelius homeowners are invited to learn more about installing solar or solar plus battery storage and get access to limited time discount pricing and other incentives. All the information you need to learn more is on the city's website. You can attend an online workshop on Thursday this week, and there are more workshops in April in English and in Spanish. And if you don't have time to do a workshop, you can simply request a custom quote for your home by following the information on the city website. That's actually what I did a couple of weeks ago and it's pretty fascinating, the information they shared with me about my home, what my options are, what works and what doesn't. So it's definitely worth your while to go and take a look to see if it's right for your home. And second, I want to say a big thank you to our communications team and everyone who works to keep our community informed through the city Views newsletter, including graphic designer Kaylee Cooper. Recently, city views switched its paper type to help community members see photos more clearly and see the colors as intended. The previous uncoated paper had left pictures appearing dark and dull and made it difficult for some to see, but not anymore. The old paper also led to calls and emails about the ink smell and we wanted to fix that as well. So thanks to our Hillsboro based printer, Lithex Printing solutions, we now have 100% recyclable paper that uses post consumer waste and doesn't have the smell. So thank you. Thank you very much. Rapping and you were done correct and thank you. Thank you very much. And also thank you for sharing your personal experience on solar solarize. Definitely recommend any community member interested to look into that. And lastly, community members who want to be informed and engaged on city council matters can sign up to receive happening in Hillsboro the happening in Hillsboro email newsletter spanish language updates are also available through our Chrysia Mohuntos newsletter. And with that, council meeting is adjourned to work session. We'll take a ten minute break and frankly, it'll probably be a 15 minutes break, but let's try for ten and we'll come back and talk about highlight. It is about time for us to start up again and we will have our work session on highlight. A great group of folks here. We're going to hear a lot of good info from. I will turn it over to Glenn guessing Gray. Yes, I will turn it over to Greg. Yeah, great. This is the year since we were here last, but we will. That's the plan. Just to get your rate early and let you know how we're doing. Progress and excitement. Enthusiasm. There is another one. So what have we been doing? Kind of the same thing we were doing last time we were here. We're building more fiber in the ground and signing up a lot more customers, which has been fantastic. And that's what we're going to keep continuing doing. And just thought we'd go over a quick background for everyone because it's pretty exciting. 2015 is when we started our first feasibility study. I was actually going through some of these files. Could not believe it was 2015. Rob",

        "text": " just I know this is important so I wanted to take some time to talk about it okay so um does c because I'm moving on to the next steps um and we're you know I slated two hours for this presentation but we can take the time because there was a lot of comments so was there anything that was on your mind or on your list to talk about that we didn't talk about councelor Byer thank you chair how um we got comments from I believe the Union County Department a very specific list of asks but it seemed to be um very thoughtful in dealing with both the construction phase and the operational phase and I'm just wondering if and I think would that be in the public Public Works standard it was dealing with all the new um or changed roads and the road width changes to deal with slope stability but um it seemed to me that there were some useful things about road maintenance that may be not necessarily addressed in this project but to keep in mind as we look at other projects to make sure in our conditions that we address both the construction and operation um and I think they had some specific asks on maintenance which is you know probably well beyond what we need to deal with but I thought it was a good outline of Road people are worried about absolutely and yeah yeah uh Public Works was a little s spart in my heart um I love my public services so that said that is what some of our agency consultation we followed up with um Scott hardell with to um the uh s the ordinance 2007 with respect to entrances to protected areas this standard is in when an applicant's developing a new street so this is his so we got he's right like this so this isn't this isn't applicable to this project basically is what he's saying here and then I followed up and I said you know asked about that letter which had a May 30 date on it but it actually is a letter from 2017 so already Incorporated so it's yeah and as you can see here because there's a road our condition says do a road use agreement they actually had whole power has already executed a road use agreement and the road and pretty much and just like again keep in mind for every every one of our facilities Road use agreements is everyone and Road use agreements again love my public I love my roads and public service and so it's one where they go out and you evaluate what roads you're going to use you check the conditions and it's a legal document that requires maintenance and improvements of roads to their standards Etc and has a whole bunch of other stuff in it too so this was part of the original um site certificate and it just continues to apply to the amendment the road use agreement um or that that letter this condition oh this condition yes yep yep it app to yep and and it's up to the county and Idaho Power to update the agreement if they feel like it's necessary we don't need to deal with that yeah we would get we would get any updated yeah okay they would be if it's updated it would be submitted to us and uh you know if they're changing the roads yes I imagine that if they're changing the roads or aspects of some part that would trigger the change the r agreement that that the the county would re-execute one I just looked at the date and didn't get yeah no the date was not it's not a May 30 comment letter date it's from 2017 thanks any other topics that we didn't cover chair how um yes um councelor Imes thank you I don't have any um questions just more of a comment this is um my first time evaluating this project and it's very very complex and I applaud you on the way that you present the information um especially for a newcomer um specifically for this amendment um after reading the comments became really clear to me that um the micro sighting versus the site boundary and just how important that is um and you explained it very well in your staff report um I understood right away that you know this uh if there's going to be um any surveys that need to be done um an analysis further analysis it would be through the ADR or Amendment yeah or or an amendment potentially um so what I saw from a lot of the comments was really this big concern right because of and you've already talked about that but I just want to reiterate from a new point of view that um I I caught on to it very quickly meaning that I understand the reasoning behind you know the decisions that have been made and and are being proposed today um and again I just really appreciate all of the hard work um you know there's I know about that much and there's like it's much so um again thank you and um that's about all I have Mr chair you yes secretary cornette yeah for the record talk cornet since you brought it up I was going to talk about this earlier but I decided not to but since you brought it up I'm going to actually make the statement so if you go look at a lot of our older facilities like particularly wind facilities it's really the applicants basically they submit what is their micro sighting Corridor and what is their site boundary IID hope power's done something a little bit different different here than most developers they started with largely a micro sighting Corridor that was the site boundary and now they're kind of expanding out beyond that to create the site boundary most facilities come in with a micro sighting Corridor and a much more significant site boundary to begin with so what they're doing is not anything different than what most developers have done the big difference that they're doing is sort of the sequencing of that so if you look back at almost all of our facilities you will see a much smaller micro sighting Corridor and a much bigger site boundary so everything that Kellen talked about you know we talked about in terms of the the certificate of holders availability to request an ADR that applies to everybody else who has a micro sighting Corridor and a much enhanced site boundary already so again the biggest thing that they're doing differently is the sequencing of creating that site boundary you know in an amendment versus from the beginning so that's really I think the difficulty that you know I think a lot of people are sort of thinking about how this is being done it's not that it's different than most other developers it's just the sort of timing and sequencing with with which they are doing it if that helps yeah and then and then the maps that show that now big wide line you know that's um and on that and I just uh because we're GNA we but I want to the condition that we um it's just like a general standard of review condition um and it's the one that basically lists out what the approved facility is and lists out all the names of all the Alternatives it also cites to the map sets that show that change and so this is I want I'm I'm like Jim if you're listening this is for you um crrider um so you know because there was uh concerns that you know this change kind of happened Midway through processing the Amendment and there are some map sets where refinement of the expanded site boundary didn't happen um and one of them so there's I think it's like map set 81 or something does actually show the line going through Morgan Lake Park um I want to make it clear on the record um as stated in the final order on the application there's no facility components located within the the boundary of Morgan Lake Park um this map that you have a here this figure 41 is the is the citation to the map set that will be associated with what they're approved to construct and you can see here that not only the facility is outside of the site boundary but the or uh of the park but also the expanded site boundary does not go into the park so just want to make that abundantly clear this is this 41 map set is the one that will be associated with what with the approved facility um um okay so okay um so the next steps okay we're going to take your comments feedback um and we're going to do a little bit more agency coordination we're going to continue doing what we do best and then we're going to do a proposed order the proposed order is the DPO and any changes we do are in red line um when we issue the proposed order we're going to issue notice of the proposed order and an opportunity to request the contested case the rule gives us a minimum of uh 30 days or thir uh 30 days for people to submit those um we're probably going to be pretty close to 30 days here now I know that we get requests to extend deadlines but I want to make this very evident this is not another comment period this is not an opportunity to submit more evidence or to refine expand change your issues right this is we I love I love buckets and I love filtering right everything went into the DP bucket and now for any folks that whose issue was not resolved so I also recommend anybody who would like to request an opportunity for contested case you know read read the proposed order the staff report you know your own issue and be like well was my issue resolved or not and right like we're narrowing any requests for contested case are limited to what was raised you know how'd you raise it what' you raise what was our response um you know and formulate it from there so that's that's the deadline um and then like kind of looking ahead and right and this is what connect the connecting the dots with your your rule making and just other other projects um which thank you council member i'ms like it is like to me I I love this stuff because I love going like oh man this is you know this is related over here and you can apply this here and to me it all kind of comes together um and um uh so you know our our threshold so if you want to ra any issue for the contested case so it has to be within your jurisdiction there were lots of what I focused on the presentation today were things that are in your jurisdiction so I didn't talk about um people's the many issues associated with how Idaho Power their consultant may be working with land owners compensation to land owners leases condemnation it's unfortunately it's out it's out of your or or fortunately I don't know it's out of your jurisdiction right we look at we look at resources we look at impacts organizational expertise retirement there's",

        "text": " that California or Canada that's they're all in Canada except for this one has a draft that's local but not out yet um um so these are some examples of questions that could be asked you'd want to know like what the policy is have them describe that how does it contribute to Salem's climate action plan and Emissions reduction goals um are there climate mitigation or adaptation measures implemented into the plan give a little more detail on if so what are they if not why not um will this initiative result in an increase decrease or the same amount of emissions and then if unknown how would that be tracked so again we're not asking them to have any details on that specifically I can go in and help them look through that and there are tools that I can connect them with to get more details on that um and then how does this option compare to other options clate impact what factors are considered in selecting this option um are there opportunities to enhance this project what are the associate costs and implications how will it be monitored and evaluated um for alignment with Salem's cap what natural hazards are in this initiative or are this initiative resilient to um what measures are in place to ensure that it remains resilient and will be able to adapt to a changing climate um and then how does it engage with and address concerns of vulnerable populations and ensure uh Equitable access to benefits on action um so if we're looking at those two types of tools the quantitative tool and the qualitative tool both make climate action a priority for the city they both or uh they can both provide data on emissions reductions but it's not required in the qualitative um and then the quantitative is less susceptible bias uh they both embed climate impact into decision-making process um the expertise that's required of other staff is only in the quantitative one uh well whereas the qualitative does not require outside staff to have that expertise um the policy Nexus is uh for the quantitative tool would be for bigger programs for the qualitative it's more flexible to be for smaller programs it would require less lift and then um the administrative burden there would be a lot Upfront for training other staff for how to go through a quantitative one versus a qualita questionnaire um and then there's more alignment with limited staff time in smaller programs as well as smaller municipalities or more of a qualitative ones so that's kind of the overview on both of those so with that in mind do we have any thoughts of what we would like to have this I'm having a little bit of a hard time wrapping my head around it so I'm not quite ready to say because I haven't quite wrap my head around it um I think I mentioned to you in our pre meeting the other day that you know we've done some similar work with the equity scoring and stuff with our Transit and I think that that's been a great process and I so I think modeling it in some similar fashion to that I think would be helpful where you can of I think I think a program something that's as objective as possible you know is always helpful and less um open to scrutiny once we agree you know what that would look like and that sort of thing but I I can't I haven't quite wrapped my head around enough to say more detail about go back to the SL the um what I what I really like about the quantitative is that I really think that this is a data driven issue and should remain so um it's really not up to debate we need to follow the science um I am concerned about the The Upfront lift for staff obviously um we have concerns there um but I'm also interested to talk a little bit more about the flexibility of the qualitative versus the quantitative if that makes sense um because I think when you get to this level of government you really do need a lot of flexibility to handle uh some of the smaller projects some of the um smaller issues throughout the city um and so I'm interested to find ways that we could maybe merge the do um right is there a third path but um but if if not I'm I'm I'm really interested in how do we make the quantitative able to be fible for the needs of our city if that makes any sense absolutely yeah so um let me just give an example there was uh a couple months ago someone had reached out about a project they were doing for Grant and they had asked how could it be evaluated for it being beneficial to and so I went through their proposal and I was able to get a rough estimate of greenhouse gas contributions they had a couple different options for that project so I was able to rate those options based on what is the best for climate and what would be the worst and I had um the opportunity to give some suggestions of how it would be more beneficial and so I could get that qualitative uh bit where they didn't have any of that information coming from it they could just say hey could you look at this and then I was able to bring back in that quantitative data science of how it would potentially play out in terms of emissions so yes we can do something like that yeah yeah I'm really interested in in kind of going down that a little bit that path and trying to figure this out I know we're not going to decide anything at this meeting I know it's going to be probably several meetings before we come up with something but in my opinion we should try and go down that path um I am really very very leery of bias in this whole um and I also want to L are you concerned that I am concerned when we talk about the qualitative um I think that um we're going to start having some really hard conversations about climate change and the impacts on community um not only because our climate is changing faster than I think any of us um are ready for um but that the changes that need to be made are going to have impacts on how people live um and people do not like change and they don't want to change we saw that in the information that you gathered from the open house in the surveys um I think they all are smart enough to know what needs to happen but knowing what needs to happen and then sticking with it to make sure that it happens and then adjusting your own life to the new reality is going to be the hard part of this conversation and that's where this is going to come into play and I think this needs to be um I don't want to say firm enough but strong enough um in order to endure that kind of um public struggle did any of that yeah makes a lot of sense yeah I mean I agree with both you I was going to mention the equity scoring thing because going through that and how successful it was to look at the projects for the bond especially um and the whole incorporating elements of both the quantitative and qualitative tool I need to go back and look at your slides again you know this is a lot to digest really quickly um in terms of bias um I mean even the economic impacts um versus Lifestyle Changes and uh as you said a lot of people realize what we need to do as long as somebody else is doing so yeah no other than so again not making a decision today but just so I'm reiterating what I'm hearing um is there a thought that anybody is more leaning towards having the climate lens upside or is is the thought that what I was hearing was kind of more universally like anytime can be applied by it and say that's for me I think that climate change is underlying every single issue that city council cases whether it's our unhoused crises to our transportation system to our planning for our future um the underlying current of all of it is climate and I think it should be agre you name it great so what I heard what I've kind of been hearing is that we'd like kind of a third option something that kind of incorp the best of world yes I will look into that and I will we like Perfection from you I was just going to share this has not been leadership this was fresh offer conference this was a great tool using so it's very hot very hot um okay so we are is that anybody have anything else on that one before we move on when can what are the next apps what um I'm guessing it now needs to go to leadership kind of get vetting there or do some more work and then take it to leadership yeah we'll be trying to develop the hybrid Perfection something that can go to Le team additional betting and so we'll just get an update our next meeting great thank you sound good I really like your example with how you approached that proposal thank you incorporating both I think that's a sort of thing do all right so we're now on to strategy1 reading implementing oh no we just did that one sorry climate actual plan updates do onil thanks John for staying on this long um so we recently finished the uh feasibility study and what I have here is one of the tables that they provided in the report and um based off of the payback period and a couple other factors kind of the financially viable option is for solar cover parking um and then in addition to providing some energy benefits it could also have improved resiliency if we pair it with battery storage or some type of Micro grid uh technology and then um either from directly the solar panels or based on having the conduit infrastructure there we could also incorporate e charging um and that was kind of the the main takeaways from that uh John did you have anything that you wanted to add hi uh good morning everyone um no I think that's a that's a great summary I mean this is pretty Stark uh um you know differentiation between groundbased systems and and you know roof mounted um one thing we are asking our consultants for is uh to extend the study out just a little bit to include the the former Herz property that we did not own when this study was undertaken so um assumption being of course that roof mounted and and covered parking over there would would be the same so um uh hopefully we'll have a scope and a fee for that here this week and um yeah other than that I don't think I have too much more to add um from a sort of a business perspective I like the idea of covered parking with solar panels I know I've seen a lot of other reports with those um because not only does it provide the the climate impact and the ability to uh offset our energy use uh which is a cost savings but it",

        "text": " there would be there would be some impacts it wouldn't be minimal there would there would be some therefore in the proposed order the department is that the theil find that minimal impacts to agriculture as a reason to support the goal exception be dropped like we don't think that that's um appropriate anymore with our additional evaluation however um that still leaves uh three reasons um that would justify taking an exception to goal three and those reasons would be that the dependency uh agricultural related benefit um and minimal impacts to other environmental resources protected by standards um with our additional review following comments from the SAG and Council we're also recommending uh amendments be made to land use conditions recommended land use 14 and 15 to ensure that um the mitigation funds represented in the application for site certificate uh are remitted prior to uh my next slide I guess just summarizes what I hope I just discussed um and so I guess this would be a great time to see if Council has any questions with uh the land use standard and how we're addressing comments received any questions from Council chair how this is ktie IMS yeah councelor ons um so thank you Chase for your presentation today um the I understand that the council is required to have three reasons um and you mentioned those just now um regarding the goal three um exception and I'm curious about minimum impacts to other environmental resources um and how you came to the determination that that was um not a factor in this um because we the prior standard that we just reviewed um was specifically about soil and that environment so um could you maybe explain a little bit more about the environmental resources sure um in the DP and and and I'm just looking at it right now it's on page 115 of the DPO um under our uh goal evaluation um we evaluate minimal impacts to other environmental resources um we say that specifically the applicant notes that the proposed facility would be cited to avoid any sensitive environmental features including Washington Ground Squirrel Habitat 100-year EMA flood planes uh us fish and wildlife service designated critical habitat Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife designated big game winter ranges and Wetlands um and that for the soil standard um ultimately conclude that taking into account mitigation the facility construction and operation of the facility is not likely to to have significant adverse impacts um okay um so I think my prior comments I wish I would have raised my hand in time um um going back to the the last um I understand that there's been some analysis done regarding the effects um chemical applications versus you know um a vegetation method and and I I still like um I have more questions regarding the long-term effects of chemical applications drinking water surface water soil Health wildlife and natural environment um the materials presented didn't actually address for me address questions um in depth and for furthermore um how will the land be able to go back into a state um so with those comments on the prior standard and then now here at in this land use um standard and evaluating the reasons for the goal three exception I feel that the minimum Environ or the um I'm sorry I don't know the exact language minimal impacts to other resources yes um that that those with those two things in mind I'm having a hard time um saying that yes they have justification um for the go three I also wanted to mention and I mean I know I'm new to this but I feel like like there's a conflict of interest when it comes to these this analysis the agricultural impacts for analysis being done by their consultant um I I really think that an outside or a thirdparty um consultant would be would be really good to see in the um so yeah those were my comments thank you uh Mr chair if I may just to kind of address the last point that council member IM brought up yes secretary cornette yeah so the you know the the applicant's consultant versus somebody else so you know is really the applicant's burden um to provide evidence on the record so that's pretty typical where you know they will hire their own consultant for or cultural resources or natural resources or anything um and we have to evaluate that to determine so I think the them doing that is not certainly you know a problem pretty consistent you know with how it's done the question then is you know who has the um expertise to review that and determine you know whether it's adequate or not so staff may have that expertise we may rely upon different state agencies or local government or we may Rely Upon Our consultant um as well but I just wanted to kind of you know touch that point to to let you know that's a pretty typical way of doing business and it is their burden you don't have to agree with it certainly um you know we've evaluated it we uh we think it's a good report we we agree with it that's not your obligation um simply because we put that in our findings but I just wanted to kind of hit that point to you know talk about you know how the process really works in terms of the applicant submitt and then our review and then council's review and I see Patrick has his hand up as well he may want to provide some context to this yeah Council row just wanted to point out I think I heard council member say that she's under the impression that an applicant when they are providing reasons for a goal exception has to provide at least three if if that's your impression Council arrives I want to make sure that understand that's there isn't a minimum number of reasons that an applicant has to provide the standard just says provide reasons for why uh so if in your opinion they have not met the minimal impacts to other environmental resources there are still two other reasons uh that they have provided and I don't know if you've expressed any concerns about those so you're saying that um if they have at least one reason then the goal three exception would not apply the rule says reasons plural okay it doesn't identify any number of reasons I have been involved in contested case where a party took the position that because it says reasons plural there would have to be the least two uh but that has that has not you know it hasn't been litigated but I think because it's plur it's a a reasonable interpretation of that would be there needs to be at least two but there isn't a there isn't a set number that they have to provide to qualify okay thank you for that so yeah again it's the environmental resources um I mean minimal impacts to AG cultural their their analysis um did find that there would be minimal impacts um but again that's that is their Consultants um review and and whatnot I know there were some comments provided by Morrow County um oh Ju Just I'm pardon me for for interrupting but that maybe I wasn't clear the minimal impacts to agriculture after after our further review following council's first um review last month of the DPO like our further evaluation we're recommending that Council find that that minimal impacts to agriculture not be considered okay clarify yeah um in some of Morrow County's they mentioned this separate mitigation apparently that's going on um and I don't know if I can talk about like can we talk about that right now in this Arena well it's in the so you're referring to the Sunstone um the one related to the Sunstone project no I'm I'm referring to Wagon Trail The Wagon Trail project and Moro County mentioned in their comments that there's some um M some um Financial mitigation apparently and there's I'm and I'm not quite sure on the number but around $500,000 is being um given to Morrow County but it's not very clear like I think OSU Extension is part of that um anyway it's to look at doing further a research in the region um and Moro County had mentioned in their comments that they um would really like to see a committee formed to help mitigate the impacts to Farmland but also probably have some oversight with the resources that are coming in and so I just not sure like how to uh if the council can respond to that or if it's um like can we suggest that a council be formed to oversee those resources does uh secretary cornet or Council row want to respond to councelor im's question there I'm happy to weigh in on that you can certainly that's why we're here today council member I is for uh to receive input from the council with any suggestions that you have uh with regard to the proposed uh they're actually couching it as uh believe it's more as an economic benefit for this project rather than a mitigation uh it's $500,000 and it's earmarked for two specific projects one the uh Oregon State uh project that you and another is purchase I think well the Oregon State one I think is purchase of equipment that is being done through that program and then the other is slipping my mind right now but it's a specific project that they've grain elevator great thank you Chase uh so I I guess I'd have to review what moral County said but I don't given that they're earmarked for specific projects and it's they have like equipment that they already know they want buy for one of them I'm not sure what the benefit of having a council or a committee review it would what they would add to that uh I'd have to see if that's I thought moral County was asking for perhaps more funding and then have more above the 500,000 then have a committee review how it might be distributed but what the staff that leads me to my next comment and that um apparently I don't know if um this is a one-time thing right like a one-time donation or whatnot for these projects and um in moral County was pretty specific in their comments about advising that a some kind of committee be formed or oversight uh regarding this because it there could be a potential uh more funding that is added to these types of you know um research um and development as far as agriculture goes um so I'm just trying to really um look at the at moral County's comments and and be you know if I can support their request at all I would um I would I would definitely like to do that and that that way you know there's if if Morrow County has a concern about these funds coming in and then not being distributed like they're supposed to be or they say they're going to be and there's no oversight for that that's kind of the the how I interpreted it so well we can certainly look at that and make sure that the you know money that's you know being proposed as part of their um the economic value as",

        "text": "ors and and as you go through the chain of employers on a construction project um to see if that would be appropriate without adding a lot of cost okay yeah that would be something I would be very interested in in looking at moving forward with um after we uh get through this uh particular um project that we have before us um I also wanted to just um State there was some comments about our our local contractors really um you know being opposed to any kind of wage theft or any kind of illegal um work that's happening um and I think that uh the intent of the union and I think the intent of uh the mayor's motion is to affirm that uh we we do affirm that and I think we are all in agreement there um I think that when we make I want to be really careful when we say there's a reporting you know mechanism or or um Avenue that that folks have access to because I don't think that that really takes into consideration the complexities of everyone's situation when they're on a job site or when they're working here in the states or um you know uh depending on how they uh came to be here um and so I want to be really uh careful with how we talk about that um to make sure that we know that not everybody has the same Privileges and access that everybody else does so I think that something uh like what the mayor has in mind is a really good step in the right direction here um to make sure that the work that is happening in the city um is um you know above board and we're all following the same rules I think is really important so I look forward to your motion thank you is there a further discussion actually we don't even have a motion yet so any other questions for staff councelor do you want to make your motion sure we have more discussion knowing that you have an amendment I will move staff recommendations is there a second second motion by Stapleton second by Gonzalez and then I have an amendment I move to amend the motion to require transparency documentation to include the identity of each contractor excuse me subcontractor and all companies performing work on the job site whether a sole proprietor independent contractor company or other entity be filed with the city at the time building permits are acquired that the list be posted on the job site and updated monthly and a final list be filed with the city upon completion of the project for each contractor and subcontractor so identified the following information will be listed scope of inspected work to be performed state contractor's license number license category and license expiration date if a license is required to perform the identified scope of work state and federal tax identification numbers valid workers comp insurance information including policy number and expiration date second thank you and I'll just speak to my Amendment this is uh I I've I've spoken to it quite a bit um it's really just an an attempt to shine light on what is a troubling situation of of wage theft and those kinds of things if they're occurring this is I'm not trying to single out this project or this uh developer in any way I intend to make this part of our standard work going forward um and we'll hope hopefully work with staff in the coming months to make this a standard part of an expectation for work in the city so we we're sure that we don't have these issues happening here and I did get this language from those transparency the laws that you referenced I did modify them a little bit to fit what I felt was the situation here um but again I just want to be crystal clear I am not attempting to single out Deacon for any special rules they just happen to be the one here and the one where we can apply these we can they can be our kind of test case for this process I was really pleased to hear that Mr Deacon wasn't opposed to them because I think you know I believe him when he says he's trying to avoid this kind of situation as well and um so I'm hoping this is a tool to help us all do that together so that's that's the motivation in this amendment Is there further discussion councel nerik sorry she went up you I'll get get to you next sure I I do appreciate the motion um you know when I when I hear a group of workers coming in and expressing concerns that they're not being heard that they're not being treated fairly that they're not being fairly and um there may be language barriers to seeking support getting investigations handled sometimes people are too scared to concerns and that's true on construction sites it's true in offices it's true in any industry so I'm aware of that and it always concerns me greatly when I see folks show up in large numbers to express their concerns so I do see this as a step in the right direction and you know I would love to hear what more we can do in the future to really try and prevent these things from happening and to send a clear message that if you want to have a construction project in this city you need to play by the rules and that whether whether you're asking for a tax exemption from us or not whether you're asking for Ur money or not and yeah I agree with not wanting to single out a specific developer Builder cont contractor subcontractor it's like no let's make sure everyone is doing things in broad daylight that they're all subject to the same levels of accountability and having them subject to public record request I think is a really great idea honestly so good work thank you counselor you're so welcome thank you councelor vanney I'm sorry I committed to going to councelor Hoy first then I'll come back to you councelor Berney councelor Hoy thank you Mr Mayor um I'm not sure who this responsibility would would sit with moving forward but is there any way to ensure the fact that something in writing is handed to each person to walk on the job that says if you're if you have issue with this or if you're not being paid um this is the number to call or just something very simple and basic offered in whatever language necessary um to make sure that folks can be made aware of the help M retherford do you have a response for that or do we want to call it Mr deacon or um you know actually it might be helpful to call up one of the gentlemen from doy construction as to the feasibility of that I it's my understanding that these are required postings on the job site can't testify from there but I can have you come up to the podium so everybody can hear and please reintroduce yourself for the record for us and I really appreciate you taking this question on the fight thank you for that uh Jim she w a uh so on all of our job sites uh small large there's there's a whole wall of federal local and state postings it'll show wage rates for everybody numbers to call it has Health stuff emergency information and so all that stuff is is currently on posted it would be posted at rivenwood it would be posted if we were doing a uh a small remodel on it it a uh dental office any doesn't matter so it's all required and is that in is that posted in multiple languages it's posted in two languages English and English and Spanish okay yeah thank you counselor does that answer your question it does thank you very much thank you for taking that question Council Bernie um thank you very much um I'm really excited about this project because there's so many advantages and I see um you know there projects next to Transit and it's downtown and I see our downtown just kind of opening up so I'm really encouraged by this um I do agree that there have been some concerns from some constituents about know the financial situation we're facing right now and the fact that um there is a lot of uncertainty and a 10-year period is a long period of time I'd actually feel a lot more comfortable if it was more like five five five year exemption um with an option of renewing it after five years um um one of my concern not it's not really a concern but we've already approved a $749,000 UR grant for this and now we're looking at the exemption um I was really not in moving in the direction to support it but now with this um amendment I think we're going in the right direction looking at things a little bit closer and also this project um if the tax exemption is approved there will be an annual reporting requirement including file reviews for the affordable units so there is going to be more oversight so with all that taken into consideration I feel a lot better thank you councelor I appreciate your comments uh and I guess I just have one final kind of to follow up on what councelor Barney said you know this um this the site of this development has been a basically just an empty parking lot for 50 years it used to be the site of the city hall until we built this building this pile of concrete 50 years ago so I would hope I don't know if you finalized the name but I would hope that if you can somehow incorporate that history into into the name I think that would be awesome because it is the site of the Old Salem City Hall so anyway uh Is there further discussion is that I see a hand and a sh and a shake so those don't go together which is it H hand got it councel n thank you I just want to say thank you to Mayor Hoy for this amendment because it really um I believe helped solidify some of the concerns and uh a way that won't require a lot of work for the Department to to manage and would be public record so thank you very much thank you guest Sut I just I I really appreciate your Amendment Mr Mayor but also recognizing that I I don't like when I hear folks that are concerned that affordable housing and upholding Fair Labor practices and uh union rights are in any way in Conflict um so I appreciate the the way that this is headed especially with your amendment to make sure that we recognize that we can do and need to do both those things at one time that we need to meet our affordable housing shortage here and also continue to uphold the right of labors for um for fair wages to ensure that their all the rights are being upheld um by the city especially and as councelor Nik said not just whenever they get um a tax abatement but whenever the city hands out any kind of a contract to make sure that we are up",

        "text": " talk today about the port westward renewable diesel project this is actually a request for an exemption from the requirement to get a site it's for renewable diesel production facility it would be capable of processing up to 50 000 barrels per day of renewable biomass speed stacks in case you're curious what that means is basically vegetable oils and animal fats is what they've said that they would use as the feedstock for this facility it would be located at port westward industrial park in scanning in columbia the applicant is next renewable fuels and the status is that we've determined the request to be incomplete at this time it's basically it's waiting on local land use approval so there are five criteria that have to be met in statute in order to qualify for the exemption from the requirement for site certificate and and one of those is that the facility has received local land use approval under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local and that the facility complies with any statewide planning goals or rules of the land conservation and development commission that are directly applicable so that's the requirement that hasn't been met once evidence of land use approval has been provided then we can find the request for exemption to be complete and then we can bring it to council for and once it's determined to be complete we're required to do that actually within 60 days let's move to the next slide this is a map that shows the location of the facility you can see it's at port westward industrial park in columbia county the total area including the site the access roads and the rail logistics is 127 acres basically they will take advantage of the proximity to the deep water port for the transport of both their feedstock and their finished goods they've stated that over 85 of the biomass feedstock required and the biofuels produced will be transported by ship or by barge and they've also stated that almost all the remaining 15 will be transported by rail so they don't expect to transport much of anything by truck it'll all be by ship or by rail then finally this is a satellite view of the area and you can see kind of starting down here in this lower right corner and going up diagonally across the top of the screen this is the the main rail line and they're proposing to construct a rail spur down here where it says railroad access that spur will cross land that's currently zoned as pa 80 or primary agriculture it's also considered to be efu or exclusive farm use there are exceptions which may allow the spur to be constructed and they'll be considered by the county as part of the land use approval so i think that covers it for now i don't know if anyone has any questions if not i will turn it over to chase i think chase you have presenter rights thank you wally well first can everyone hear me all right and can everyone see my screen yes yes okay cool and before i get started i wanted to let councilmember jenkins know via katie that the battery storage for nolan hills would be 120 megawatts in response to your question so the battery storage for nolan hills would be 120 megawatts thank you let's see sorry now good morning madam chair grail vice chair howe and members of the council for the record my name is chase mcvey and i am a senior signing analyst with the department the wagon trail i'm going to start my my project updates with the wagon trail solar project the wagon trail solar project is a solar photovoltaic energy generation facility with a generating capacity of approximately 500 megawatts the applicant for the wagon trail solar project is wheat ridge east wheat bridge east wind llc um a wholly owned subsidiary of next era energy resources and they proposed to develop the facility in morrow county near the city of arlington and the proposed facility would be within would be located within 739 acre site boundary which is equivalent to approximately eleven and a half square miles as as represented in the noi the solar array itself is only anticipated to occupy approximately 5 000 acres of those 7 339 within the site boundary related or supporting facilities include among other things a a distributive energy storage system lithium-ion and an eight mile 230 kilovolt transmission line the department previously received a notice of intent for this facility in november of last year november 2020 the department issued a public notice on the notice of intent uh in november as well and held an information meeting for this facility in the ny in january of this year 2021. due to modifications of the proposed facility the applicant submitted and amended noi in june of this year on on june 11 2021 and the department anticipates applicant providing or submitting a preliminary application for site later this month or early next month in just a couple weeks ago on august 17th the department released its first amended project order based on the amended noi now i will go into a couple figures here is a map of the proposed facility's site boundary in relation to highway 84 and up here in this top corner is in the top left corner of the screen is the columbia river and lexington is to the south arlington is on 84 a little bit to the west and it is beneath the boardman bombing range which is this large area without any uh irrigated crop circles um and then i will go into one more figure this is a snippet i took of our department's uh gis mapping tool from our website and here hopefully this helps to further illustrate where the facility is located and where it's located in association with other uh approved the wagon trail solar facility here in this figure is uh represented as the blue polygon the the green polygon on this screen is the wheat ridge renewable energy facility three and the purple represents the wheatridge renewable energy facility one wheat ridge renewable energy facility two is south and is this red um polygon as well here to the upper left is the cardi facility and in red is um cardi cole plan unless anyone's got any questions i'm going to move on to my next project madam chair this is henley i'm chase go ahead and ellie the eight mile transmission line is that shared with the wind projects i would have to look back at the noi i don't know off the top of my head and maybe sarah if she's on the the meeting right now would know um otherwise i can um loop back around with that answer okay we have so many i mean we have other solar lots of wind you know all together here and i just i didn't know whether they were developing a brand new eight mile transmission line just for this um this solar or that's be interesting to know i can look into it um councilmember jenkins and get back to you with the response later in the day sure thank you okay unless there's any other questions i will move to the next my next project update is for the boardman solar energy facility request for amendment one the approved facility um borman solar energy facility is not yet constructed and it's a 75 solar photovoltaic power generating located within a site boundary of approximately 798 the site certificate holder is boardman solar energy llc a subsidiary of invenergy llc and as far as location is concerned the solar energy generation components of the facility will be located in morrow county however the 115 kilovolt transmission that would connect the energy facility to the grid will be located entirely within gillom county so the facility is located in both counties however the only component within gillom county would be the transmission line and here we go um with regards to amendment one on august 4th of this year the department received a complete request for amendment one of the boardman solar energy facility and request for amendment 1 seeks council's approval for a three-year extension to both the construction commencement and completion deadlines the construction commencement deadline would be extended from february 23rd earlier this year to february 23rd and the new construction completion deadline would be extended to february 23rd 2027 as secretary cornett mentioned during his secretary report um today on august 12th the department determined that a type b review for request for amendment 1 was justified based on review of the type b adr or amendment determination request provided concurrent with the type b adr determination justification the department also issued its draft proposed order on uh request for amendment one on august 12th and the issuance of the draft proposed order began a 25-day comment period on the dpo and complete request for amendment one and the comment deadline comments on the dpm request in the complete rfa september 6 and here is just a figure of the proposed facility or of the approved facilities site boundary and so it's this pink just directly beneath or south of and this tail of the line is the transmission line the sole component within gillom everything else is in morrow county on to the next my last and final project update of the day is for the stateline wind project stateline wind facility is an operational wind energy facility consisting of two units state line one and two and vancicle two state line one and two is composed of 186 wind turbines and has a peak generating capacity of up to 123 megawatts whereas vancicle 2 consists of 43 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 99 megawatts the site certificate holder is fpl vancicle llc for state line one and two fpl energy state line two incorporated for van sickle two which are both subsidiaries of nextera energy resources but this the facility is located in umatilla county entirely on private land north and east of the city of helix as far as procedural history is concerned the approved facility on uh on may 17 2019 council approved a fifth amended site certificate which authorized the certificate holder to repower existing wind turbine blades in the for being for the operating bansicle 2 unit and the certificate holder must initiate by 2022 let's go on to what the request for amendment 6 is requesting and seeking on july 12 2021 the department received a preliminary request for amendment 6 to the state line win project facility site and the preliminary request for requests changes uh requests two primary changes the first is to add 50 meg",

        "text": " is useful here one is addressing Financial barriers with a strong and stable incentive for projects that then meet those carbide criteria that I was just talking about and second by addressing non-financial barriers like program complexity by providing enhanced technical assistance and potentially project matchmaking services to community-led projects next slide so for strategy one and here we're really talking about financial assistance and incentives um the problem that we found is that many carve out projects will require additional funding um to get across the finish line and while there have been paths incentive offers available through Energy Trust through Odo through USDA PCF and utilities to provide grants and apprentices to um to projects many of these are kind of temporary in ad hoc and there's not there's not a long-term consistent Statewide incentive Source uh that's uh that's available to help get its carbon projects developed through the community solar program and so our core concept would be to put together a stable incentive that's available to any project that meets both solar for all requirements meaning that 50 of the project would be available to eligible residential participants and also csb carbon criteria which would be 50 slogan participation uh we're interested in targeting a mix of small community-led projects as well as larger potentially private sector projects and I would be intending to offer an incentive to uh to any project that's able to meet that 50 low-income participation threshold uh while delivering those mandatory Bill discounts we also know that to enable some of the smaller Community skill projects there might need to be an additional incentive that helps address some of the higher construction costs and currency go down in size so we're looking at a long-term stable incentive offer that would help fill out the problem with the um the community solar program prep out next slide the the second strategy that we're looking at getting away from Strictly financial assistance is thinking about how to overcome some of the non-financial barriers in the program so we do know that the Oregon Community solar program is a complex program to navigate especially for a community-based organization that is not a professional seller developer and who might not be well suited to be a long-term owner manager of a project so as energy trusts we already have a few different technical assistance tools we've put to use such as early stage Community Solar Development assistance as well as Project Specific coaching and technical assistance which we partner with bef to deliver to help some of these community-led carve out projects come forward but we have seen that that's not enough and that there's still a substantial unmet demand from Community groups that would like to make Community solar projects work but have both financial and non-financial barriers so we're really interested in using this funding as a way to dramatically increase the technical assistance that's being offered to to community groups that may want to be parts of the community center program and we're also considering taking a more assertive role in the program and providing sort of a matchmaking service between project developers cbo's and project managers and I'll talk a bit more about that on the next slide so next slide please so the way that this could work this sort of enhanced matchmaking service um Energy Trust would first establish Partnerships with Community organizations that want to bring Community solar to their communities who are willing to support Community solar customer enrollment and who can I mean who represent communities that are eligible for solar for all dollars but don't really have the um the the interests or capabilities to be a long-term manager of a project uh we then use slur for all dollars and potentially other dollars to manage a procurement process um to uh to develop Community solar projects by energy trust's trade holiday Network for example on non-residential facilities that might lack the the on-site that might be a good candidate for solar but not have the on-site load that would make a traditional net metering installation work well then we would separately procure in contracts with one or multiple organizations to serve as a project manager or some of these uh projects so we'd be separately building Partnerships and then um and then aligning both the three organizations the community groups that would bring the communities to the to the projects the trade Ally contractors that would develop the projects and the project managers that would be responsible for them long term and there's still a lot of a lot of dots to be connected here for example how project ownership work for some of these projects but we're interested in using this as a role to really identify what is the right role for community groups to play in the program and then helping bring the partners to make those projects be realized next slide please so there are a few requirements of solar for all that need to be navigated and aligning it well with the Oregon Community solar program we'll talk about a few of them here the first is that there's different income criteria in the Oregon Community solar program and solar for all the requirements for the income based requirement for solar for all is generally a bit more rigid and so not all participants that would qualify as low-income customers in the community solar program would qualify as eligible recipients and solar for all and that's when they would need to be navigated both by the program and by projects um second is the geographic requirements of justice 40 which Jen already mentioned uh 40 percent of the total spending uh would would need to benefit customers that live in designated Justice sporty areas and we imagine that requirement of flood would flow through to any Oregon Community solar projects that receive funding and this could be especially tricky to make sure that we're complying within PGE service territory where there's relatively few Geographic areas of it that are identified by the by the justice 40 tool so that's something that would need to be navigated as well and then third There's an opportunity to use to live for all dollars to um to integrate storage and to install Surplus storage on critical facilities and provide um uh in times when the grid goes down which is something that is technically allowed within the community solar program but there isn't a clear pathway to make it work um so some CHC so some uh some program revisions to the community solar program would be necessary to make it possible to enable storage and that's something that we're interested in seeing if there's a possibility to to make it work next slide and so some of the areas we'd love feedback on from the stakeholder communities is first is the core incentive concept that we're proposing viable see we think that's going to be an effective way to fill the program carve out and really deliver Community solar to the desired populations second is the matchmaking concept that we laid out both needed and viable third what else can we do to address some of the non-financial barriers the small scale Community solar projects encounter and then also what other ideas and suggestions do you have um so that's it for me and back over to Rob's transition to the the cou side alrighty thank you Ryan and yeah we will move right on to Bonneville environmental founder or Bonneville environmental foundation and Evan will walk us through this concept thank you rob um and everyone here on the the webinar uh thanks for joining I see a lot of uh friendly names in the chat um a lot of experts in community solar and would value your input as we move this program forward here um move to the next slide please I'm going to start with a little bit of an overview of the Bonneville environmental foundation and our work and how that relates to community solar and and where we're going to go from here um just to recap I'm Evan Ramsey I'm the senior director of the Renewables program here at bef I've been doing solar for over 16 years and we've been working with many of our consumer and Utility Partners in Oregon and in the region to assist them in scoping and delivering Community solar projects among other Technologies but this is the brief overview of what I will get into and at the end you know certainly want um your input on how we're designing this program to serve consumer owned utilities these are really projects that are enabled by these utilities when there's no mandating policy from the state it really is up to our Utility Partners in how they design these projects and we want to provide the right kind of support and resources to them as we move into this five-year next slide please so organizationally bef we have a focus on energy carbon and water and we have a National Water stewardship program energy education program our Renewables program is very focused in the Pacific Northwest here and then we do also deal in renewable energy certificates carbon offsets and water restoration next slide please our Renewables program has had a core focus of late in these areas we do have a strong focus on our consumer-owned Utility Partners both in Oregon and regionally and we've helped them in a variety of ways from feasibility studies to technical assistance and project grant funding we've done most of our electric vehicle programming in partnership with with utilities we have also been advancing tribal renewable energy projects and have been involved in low-income solar programming and projects for about the past seven or eight years next slide please um when we when we focus on low-income benefiting solar we are really focused on providing um really what the goals are of this EPA solar for all program which is economic and environmental benefits to disadvantaged communities and bef we do that almost exclusively through strong Partnerships we are always working with utilities tribes local governments affordable housing providers other non-profits the list goes on we really feel like we can go further together and we rely on our partners to um help new spreadsheet I'm really proud of myself I feel like yeah Richie you might want to mute there some of the services we provide are in the the right column there it runs the gamut from you know early scoping financial analysis all the way to project management and um uh contractor selection and even some of our energy education programs now this is this is what we have been doing historically and in the past um moving forward the role we feel um might might look a little different within Oregon's program and regionally um and that's hopefully what we can help co-design and plan for uh moving forward next slide please uh just to illustrate uh some of the Partnerships that we've formalized over the years you know this is even a small smattering of the partners that we've engaged with um and this is a little bit of a dated slide but um you can see that the range of Partners from non-profit to public to um and I probably could have five more slides listing the great Partnerships that we've been privileged to participate",

        "text": " um I just wanted to kind of put that out there as like another perspective when we're having these conversations about like what it looks like on the ground in terms of reducing our transportation I think the missionary because thank you this I understand is any report but we do have some state and federal legislation that says targets for certain things there's a target for electricity reduction abuse of natural gas CO2 emissions there's a target for electric vehicles and I'm wondering if you know process of doing the inventory around I'm wondering here we're in our planning are we getting do you get any projections of what they impact on inventory might be if we actually start to meet those goals and um because it seems to be the biggest factors here these are those are the two biggest factors if we eventually achieve the goals of electric vehicles and achieve the goals how that we have any projections or any ideas that targets in relation to those of those Point impact with those two goals the targets that were set at an overall goals um yeah how might that reduce the inventory it's the interaction of those two um goals and or CO2 efficient okay that's a wonderful question um I know that we did and I think it's quite complicated we did do some forecasting as part of the climate action and development process I don't know how involved that was if we looked at some of these recent legislations part of that we have not done any projections or forecasting resembling this was our first kind of check-in and we will update um but I've heard that interest from others in this and I'm just diving in and trying to do that hey everybody I'm Robert Chandler assistant director of Public Works um not so much I think you've had answered it uh very well that we're looking at it uh the hard part is there's a we can do a lot well as individuals and small changes but we lost in the noise that's a major something that occurs um and a lot of transportation is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gases that's not an engineering or a technical issue that's a cultural issue um is financial wanted want more bus routes and easier access and more regular routes and all the things and maybe you want to ride the bus uh that requires a higher tax so there's all I think last time I had a different content to talk about trade-offs that's that's the moment among the things I'm hopeful for is we don't have data because we shifted our data set for transportation a little English before to looking at how the data did a couple of years on our inventory of what happens there hoping that we don't have another pandemic to accomplish things as well I understand it's really complicated there's a lot of cultural factors you know can't we really get the EB goals and if we do Innovative Finance road maintenance that we don't use the gas debts um there's lots of factors there though it's just an interesting thing to me that we have these laws out there that set some goals and schemes that want things we kind of look at or keep seeing what we can figure out is what if we achieve those goals for some of those timelines what impact it it might have because uh might serve as a reference point for or justification for trying to move the cultural needle a little farther along and I'm sitting there and about actually necessarily knowing how difficult it is to do and I realize it's difficult it seems to me that at some point that's a nice reference point that says look this law says this and if if what would the CO2 emissions in our area B if they actually entered since they actually meant their goal of um by 2040 because our goal is neutrality by 2050. did that have us reaching our goals same with Eaves I understand it cultural aspects of it because I've done a different conversation with trying to decide which car to buy and is it worth the extra cost compared to the amount of I drive and the cost of gas and things like that but you know that's in the current it's not on future market and I think at some point well it's something to keep in mind as we're doing this is be nice to answer the good these targets how those targets going to be effective if they meet the targets that are already well the comments any other questions it's just like maybe a comment and then I'll end with the questions at the agenda here my my thought on some of this is that there's a danger in making some of this too complicated and getting caught up in modeling and math there are some general numbers out there that we know uh for Heating and Cooling buildings and water is about what 25 of gas emissions or 25 of CO2 emissions we have the tools now to move that number quite a bit it's the question of whether we want to put some of those tools in place I mean uh commissionable living pride is better than I do but there are many opportunities in the life cycle of a building to increase efficiency is not um replacing HVAC systems for basic groups to replacing windows in every one of those opportunities is a chance to kind of Ratchet down energy use and increase efficiency the question is whether or not those opportunities are built in or incurred by our code and that have on the market side whether those are efficient for people you know whether it cancels out or people are closely pencils out for people when they do it so I think that is one thing the city can look at in our own code is to say okay you're going to be replacing fast and stuff what are you replacing your HVAC system when and that is something that we can talk about in the Planning Commission and I think we'd have a conversation with the city council about what kind of subsidies or discounts we might be able to provide the city whether it's a tax rebate or something and how that Stacks up with other federal and state programs I'm talking about goals the state to Circle 500 000 new team pumps installed uh over the next decade that's that's that would make a significant impact you know how can Salem connect with that so it's in terms of some of these major numbers that we're looking at uh there's a way that we can start to tackle that it's the same with Transportation we're looking at completely refrigating our road systems and our Landing systems what we really need to do is over the next decade they're going to buy an electric car we have an electric car and we have a clean energy portfolio you literally can solve the large portion of the transportation problem so the question is how do we get people when they buy their car what do people tend to do every 16 years uh how do we get people then to switch from a gas car to an electric car and from the land use perspective how do we support electric cars which is where the EV infrastructure how well does it work these are the kind of questions that we as a Planning Commission help figure out and move those numbers I think in a pretty significant way if we can tie them to financial incentives and other incentives that are operated through the state and federal government there is a plan that we can put in place because we can take advantage of these replacement cycles that people have at the bars and building parts and things like that that kind of difference and I understand that at some point in the future maybe you can answer this sale will have an opportunity to buy into the energy portfolio we have a green terror coming at some point in the next several years um yes PGE that was that was built in baked into house bill 2021 um that PG and Civic power can create a new retail program that would be opt out as it started so it's something that the umbrella tariff is something that BGE and others are working on right now it doesn't sound um they were working to file by the end of the year hopefully with the notorious commission um but that's kind of get to be determined so it is a ways out they're working on yeah so if we look at it if we take 20 35 as a goal and start working backwards on some of these replacement Pace uh I think I think there's a bigger potential to move the needle than we might otherwise then thank you Mr selector any other comments for questions for Jennifer Heather could you talk a little bit about what the city is doing to try and meet some of these goals certainly yes um we've got a lot of different activities underway actually um you know the climate action plan itself has almost 200 different strategies and we've embedded in it and there's a number of um that are underway across the city um focus that I've been working on for our work plan we are looking at for transportation we're looking at potentially charging for Downtown parking Central business district is something that's currently under review but just recently eliminated parking and runs across the city I think that was the main so that was a big one let's see each do we have any electric vehicles that I repeat we do have uh I think it's one maybe two by now electric vehicles we did creative policy to transition eventually our vehicle will be over to Electric as well as our equipment we're working on that as well uh we're working on a huge transportation thing is the transportation system plan that's now underway that's other staff will work you know multi-year effort that's incorporating on an equitable role making listening to that so that's a big um energy wise we're looking at right now from our work plan for this year is a comprehensive approach to reducing our own energies in a municipal buildings um a big one something and then we'll leave the different options for right um we received grant funding for the state's first micro break we do microgrid um Public Works building that's just kind of as a few examples of many different things that are underway as part of information big broadcast something to add judging by five language yes I can add a couple more also but I'm interested in the list that Heather provides we are reviewing and updating our transportation system planes along these companies policies and practices it's a long process going on that includes scenario planning from a regional basis on the planet of actions um we are reporting on a greenhouse gas emissions regularly now is just yourself part of that now we are close to hiring a full-time clinician but I do kind of actually my manager um we are looking at oh on the concept of electric vehicles on our Fleet he has approval for uh and funding to provide the first ever for us electric street sweeper utilities um we're working with and uh we started updating our natural Hazard",

        "text": " they're recorded you can view them live uh but then they're recorded and available to view afterwards yeah that good thanks for passing that on all right I think that concludes the Council report wonderful so if we move on to agenda Item B we have consideration by Council of permanent amended rules for standby generator exemptions this is an action item for Council we have Thomas Jackman rules coordinator here to present to us good morning Tom good everyone uh so yeah we're here to discuss the um adoption of standby generator exemption rules that have been amended um go ahead and go to the next slide uh previe slide yep there we go um so again just as a reminder this we're here doing this role making as a result of a house bill 2063 that was passed in 2021 uh which prohibits Council from requiring a person to proposing to construct a standby generating facility from submitting an exemption request to council uh it doesn't change whether or not a project would would be subject to council jurisdiction it's just whether or not they have to seek uh approval from Council for that exemption uh so if you can go to the next slide please so that that uh law basically just I mean it's pretty straightforward just states that uh well this is what standby generating facility is um that it's an electric generating facility in and and including standby generators in the physical structure necessary to install and connect standby generators that provide temporary electric power and the inventive of power outage and the important part here is that it is electrically incapable of being interconnected with the transmission transmission grid which is why it's a standby generator and why it's exempt from Council jurisdiction um next slide please so Council rules currently require that any person wishing to construct an operative facility exempt from Council jurisdiction shall submit a request for exemption to the Department of energy before beginning construction so we as we discussed previously this proposed rule Amendment removes the requirement to seek councel approval for an exemption as it pertains to the construction of a stampo generator and just the the rule change is what you see here in 360 uh one and then in division 5015 368 and per your uh council member Conan's request um the language was tweaked a little little bit for readability uh for that uh part eight there um but essentially it's now it now States except as noted in 8 and then eight states requests for an exemption under Oar 34515 356 for a standby generation facility uh are not required any questions uh next boom as they say so Council has three options as usual you may approve the proposed rules as presented you may approve the proposed rule with changes or you may take no action at this time chair G Vice chair how um since this all this is doing is implementing the statutes as uh required so Madam chair I move that the council adopt the proposed standby generator exemption rules as presented in the notice of proposed Ru making thank you Vice chair how we have a motion council member Byer I would second the motion to approve thank you we have a second is there any deliberation hearing and seeing none Mr secretary please call the rooll Perry chocktoot yes Ann berer yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes yes Jordan Tru it boom I yes motion carries Madam chair thank you well Tom that was uh expedited fashion um thank you for that the motion carries and we conclude agenda Item B so if we move on to the next agenda item this is the 2024 recommended ruem schedule this is an action item and information item and oh wow we still have Tom here to present with us again thank you so much um so yes I'm here today to discuss the schedule for the next year and kind of give you maybe a little bit of a forecast on what we're g what the goal is over the next three years I have now been the role making coordinator for a little over a year so uh whereas last year when I presented the schedule I was sort of a little bit more in the dark about how feasible our schedule was and how to go about things uh I'm a little bit more comfortable with the roeming um process and H and how our process in specific works for uh FC and for the council and uh so we have a much more ambitious schedule this year we have a lot to get through uh there's a lot of demand for um whether you know across you know sort of political and various spectrums in the public uh for or against projects and so we want to make sure that our processes efficient and as uh the the least overbearing is that it possibly can be as clear as possible and as uh you sort of meeting the needs of the of the latest technology and and the latest trends and and that are you know that they're essentially up to dat so with that um go ahead and let's go to the next slide first I just as a brief uh oh and there's also going to be an opportunity for public comment just just to point that out as well before Council Council deliberation go ahead next slide so just as a reminder uh the ru making process starts with uh well it really starts with us figuring out and presenting the schedule and getting it approved from from Council uh but for a particular rule we uh sort of scope it out we figure out exactly what we want to propose and then we present that to council and that is what we consider initiation of rming where we where Council approves sort of the scope direction that they give in rle making uh then there's various types of Outreach uh we can have requests for public comments or a work group or uh as the as the practice is becoming uh more frequently a rules advisory committee uh for a variety of reasons but uh we use those opportunities to kind of get the best information uh the best analysis in terms of what the rules language should look like we use that to draft proposed rules uh and then we have a notice of proposed rle making which starts a public comment period uh we are not required to but we always hold a public hearing which is typically at a council meeting although if it's like for the standby generator one we did not for that one uh we then once that period is over uh we take into account any feedback draft a proposed uh permanent rules and present those at a council meeting like we did today for the standby generator uh and then they're adopted and that's it they become the rules so uh just to sort of a kind of an overview of the process to to kind of help you remember what's what's all involved here as we go through these various Ru making proposals Tom this chair gril um I don't want to speak for anyone but I believe after us working together for years one of the things I think we've all unless there's been some extraordinary reason why I think the public comment period we've been very vocal in our opinion that anytime There's an opportunity to hear from the public we are dram rally in favor of that so I just wanted to put that on the record and if anyone disagrees by all means but I've heard it for several years now yeah and that's direct that has directed our desire to hold those public hearings at uh Council meetings unless we think there's like almost you know zero interest in the in the role making or a very low likelihood of public uh comment there were zero comments for the standby generator exemption rule making uh but if there's even a modum of Interest then it is our intent to hold those at uh council meeting so that any public comment can be heard by you uh in person thank you yeah thank you for that okay so the uh first I thought we'd go over the 2023 uh R making activity uh as you can see here on this slide we adopted three uh rules last year um the first one the protected areas one was actually the tail end of 20 22 but it was after the previous summary so it's on this slide um it was in December but uh we finished the application process review one in June uh and then a couple months later we finalized the radioactive waste material Ru making uh we just concluded the our business with the standby generator rle making uh today and we are currently underway on the contested case rle making uh the rack is currently considering draft language and you may be hearing very soon uh on that one so that will be very interesting although we may potentially have a dential rack meeting we'll see uh the next one is scheduled for the first part of February uh we are currently working on the research reactor uh rule rules which are we have draft language and it's just we're just trying to get feedback from the key stakeholders on that uh and we have begun scoping the amendment rule making although have not presented to council is that first bubble that for kind of initiation of rle making but we intend to do that very soon and then uh lastly if you can if you want to go to the next slide I have a slide on this DEQ uh rle making uh that we're doing for them which relates to adopting language uh that will impact noise analysis for solar projects and it's essentially uh an adoption of rules that have been applied that were created for wind projects back in 2004 and have operated just fine for the last 20 years so uh the thinking is why not have that same sort of analysis framework for uh solar projects and so we're underway to do that do you guys have any questions about that where what we've done this last year council member buer chair gr um when I listened in on the Lexington public hearing one of the comments was about the Drone from batteries associated with storage for solar so just want to make sure that that's considered as part of the noise update I think in 2004 we probably didn't account for that it may just be background noise um I I don't know but since that comment was raised it's probably important to have um a noise analysis or measurement of of that kind of constant noise which yeah absolutely so just to be clear the uh the carve out sort of so to speak for the wind rules did not like negate the need for analysis for wind turbines uh and nor will it negate the need for noise analysis for solar projects it's just a it's just a change from the base assumptions in terms of like the noise floor uh for the ambient noise and uh I don't know if you want to speak to anything more beyond that yeah there's really um so",

        "text": " but I was fascinated by I was gotten intrigued by Mr Stanley's comment so I may have lost it are there any other questions from other counselors counselor Barney thank you mayor Roy uh I had a couple questions about the uh project schedule and I know expediency is the key here and we need to get get a decision made and the city's done a wonderful job great Deep dive into providing the information I guess my concern is when we first started this process the airline we were looking at service starting in the spring uh now when I look at this project schedule it looks like it's going to be delayed until September because the TSA has to receive its airport security plan and then review it and then they can do their stuff so my question is and and you may not be able to answer this is is in terms of negotiations with the airline how do they deal with issues like this with TSA the airline has a has a preferred start date and they're shooting for the spring because that is just a great time for them to launch new service and you want to launch new service when you have the best chance of success they understand that the city has a heavy lift in front of it we've been communicating with them all through the year trying to help them understand the various processes that you saw earlier on on Mark's presentation so they're sort of along with the TSA kind of working with us to kind of understand what's the optimistic and what's the realistic start date and I think they'll just they're going to have to adjust accordingly obviously they can't have a start date that we can't meet or that the TSA can't meet so it's it's a little bit of a squishy answer I know it's just something that we're all going to have to work together on to come up with a date that we feel like is more realistic and then it'll be up to the airline to decide if that's a good start date for them or if they would rather delay until a more a better start date for their business but we're in constant contact with them in fact I have bi-weekly meetings with the airline representative just to keep them updated on progress I'm quite sure they're watching this meeting tonight they're anxiously waiting the city's decision to move forward or not and that's kind of the best answer I can give you okay thank you very much and Mr Pascal I remembered uh what I wanted to ask you about so and this is really about the nature of aircraft the the 45 000 planes that are currently taking off and landing at our airport can you give me an idea of what size what what's the range I know that we have some airplanes and helicopters that are quite loud um especially the helicopters uh can you give me an idea of what we have currently taking off and landing and how that might compare to the potential noise from these types of aircraft that we're talking about it would be difficult for me to give you a noise comparison what I can tell you is that the military accounts are about 10 percent of our operations so most of our military is National Guard helicopters so there's 4 500 to 5 000 operations a year there they are quite loud particularly in the summer time when they're ramping up and doing the reservist training of the remainder I would estimate that about 80 percent are just privately owned single engine or twin engine aircraft there our aerobatic aircraft based on our airport they're very loud they make quite a noise when they leave the airport but we do have fly fly friendly procedures in place so they try and minimize noise as they cross neighborhoods and then the remainder a combination primarily of business Jets locally based and then what we call transient business operations so business jets that fly into the airport to do business here Costco Union Pacific Railroad caterpillar companies like that fly in regularly that would be my best guest breakdown without having any information in front of me I understood I appreciate that and compared to say some of those bigger corporate debts that are landing right now are the the Jets that we're talking about going to be uh are they going to be louder not as loud roughly the same compared to corporate Jets I would estimate that they're roughly the same they fly similar sized engines I mean Airline engines are certainly larger but they're also very noise efficient these days the airline industry has done its best to reduce noise around the country biofuels and alternative fuels were mentioned earlier the aviation industry worldwide recognizes itself as a as a polluter both in noise and of emissions around the world so they're they're making great steps to try and be better Neighbors in transportation Council Stapleton thank you yes I agree with that statement I live right underneath the flight path and um so I have I've never received a noise complaint from you or something yes because I I moved there and so I have to deal with that um it's funny at our house we view uh noise pollution as secondhand smoke um so it is an air pollutant and it is something we have to pay attention to um I would love to talk a little bit about climate action and I'm not sure if it's going to be you or somebody else who can answer these questions for me in dealing with all of this information of course climate action for all of us I know we are all very serious about this topic and so I was trying to find ways think creatively about ways that we could address both of these concerns moving forward and I would love to find some way for us to support public transportation through this process and whether it's a Transit day pass with each ticket or a surcharge or fee that would be directed towards public transportation is this something that we can do and how would we go about doing something like that and I had one more after that so I know Kristen you're thinking thank you the only way I could think of doing this would be similar to what we've done for the the youth program with Chariot uh and it would need to be funded through the general fund okay but there's no way to link it maybe through the The Airliner fees or any kind of per ticket cost just um for a council reminder and because several of you weren't on Council last spring we are waiving all fees for the airline for the first couple of years um so we would not be collecting it through fees until that waiver has um and again since the airlines are low cost and they're looking for subsidies and fee waivers um I would not anticipate that this is something a financial obligation that they would want to take on it would be out of the line with their business practice I think if if we wanted to do something like this that we would need to fund it through the general fund okay thank you my other interest was in starting a climate action fund for carbon offsets that could be offered at the airport to folks who are traveling through that could possibly fund some of our other climate action goals here locally something I'd be interested in I want to put that out there you don't have to answer me at all but I want to let you know what I was thinking about thank you uh Council Nordike so I want to follow up on counselor Stapleton uh said because I'm thinking of that as well too uh carbon offsets is something I think that we should absolutely explore and perhaps directing staff to look into that in the future could be worth following up on um tree plantings and various other things I know we've also talked in Prior meetings about making sure that we have a very convenient chariots drop off right at the front of the airport nobody wants to Lug a suitcase especially if they have a couple kiddos in tow even so much as a hundred feet between the airport and rainy Salem Oregon so I would encourage us to work with our chariots board to ensure that we can have a convenient drop-off access to and from to encourage people to take public transit to the airport as an additional option but I would love to follow up on carbon offsets because I was thinking of that as well but I didn't know who exactly to ask because it's not really on our agenda tonight but I think it should be thank you thank you councilor I I too would be interested in exploring that conversation see what options are out there I don't know what other municipalities are doing or other other airports but that's I think something that we could task staff with doing some research and coming back to us and talking about those options in the future what are what are you know I think it's an evolving uh industry and an evolving mindset so I think that there's probably a lot of things out there that we're not aware of but I would like to hear more about that in the future so um I don't know if you need more Direction than that Mr manager if that kind of gives you some somewhere to go no that's clear and I've got some ideas great thank you we'll look forward to hearing back from you on that in the future uh counselor Phillips uh thank you mayor Hoy and I really appreciate the discussion from my colleagues so far a lot of really good ideas being brought um this is probably like the same question the second time uh but just maybe so I can make sure I'm grasping this correctly uh as an emergency room doctor here in the Salem area uh there are times where you know Salem can feel pretty more remote uh like in terms of when we had the ice storm and there was no power for most of us living here in Salem for you know several days or even weeks in a row um and you know we've had other disasters we've had the the forest fire smoke in the fall of 2020 um where the air quality was dramatically affected and the canyon was burnt out uh it's my understanding that FEMA utilized our airport and it's just one example of the importance of that resource in ways that community members not may not have on top of mind so for me being concerned about natural disaster a potential or near guarantee at some point in our future of a seismic event affecting us in a way that I don't think any of us can fully appreciate until it happens I look at this as a really important for that preparation in terms of you know emergency preparation and disaster preparation once we get to the 10 000 you know flights of commercial commercial air service we get opened up for federal funding for capital projects to the tune of nearly a million dollars a year 800 900 000 a um so",

are the wishes of board we have a motion and a second all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you directors any opposed the motion carries unanimously 7 to zero next we have two different action items the first one is to approve the resolution and order in the matter of amending the Housing Authority board of directors bylaw rules of procedure welcome to Molly Rogers the executive director of the Housing Authority uh and to Melissa son Salah did I pronounce that right salala salal salala thank you Melissa for helping me with that thank you for asking and uh please take it away good morning directors for the record my name is Molly Rogers and I am the executive director of the housing authority of Washington County this agenda item is a followup from the December 6th habad meeting when we first discussed some of these changes I am joined this morning by U Melissa senala who is our policy and planning manager to cover the highlights of the proposed changes I just want to take a minute to acknowledge that your questions in December seem to pertain to the governance structures between the County Commission Board of Commissioners and the board of directors of the housing authority of Washington County or Hawk is what we like to call it so I just wanted to take a moment to cover uh the legal relationship between the two as way of background Hawk is a component unit of Washington County formed under Oregon revised statutes 45609 HUD provides Federal pass through resources only to housing authorities of which there are around 3,000 in the country these Federal programs are the Section 8 or housing Choice voucher program the public housing program additionally Hawk has leveraged other federal funds and administers affordable housing using the HUD multif family 68 program the US Department of agricultural rural housing program and the low-income housing tax credit program the Housing Authority board of directors was established in November 2000 effective 2001 with rules of procedure established by resolution and order on January 23rd 2001 it does not appear that there has been significant updates to the rules of procedures since then so we are now proposing a full revision of the bylaws and rules of procedures to bring them up to date with current best practices I'll now hand it over to Melissa uh so thank you Molly covered most of this um I I just want to say that um the recommended bylaws and rules of procedure that we're bringing today do not have any significant changes from what we brought in December on December 6th um we were able to CL clarify some of the questions that were raised um and they were already covered in the draft uh so I'm just going to go through the Articles really quick article one doesn't have any uh major significant changes it's the introduction and definition very standard article two um is a significant addition to the bylaws it defines the terms and responsibilities of directors um it was missing in previous versions and is a really common element of bylaw so we felt we needed to include it um it does include that the appointed directors so the two directors who aren't County Commissioners will serve terms of four years um establishes expectations around attendance and standards of procedure in the event of a vacancy or a resignation uh article three defines the responsibilities of officers including the chair Vice chair secretary and clerk there were some changes in this section but most of the section had already existed um at our previous meeting commissioner fi asked about the comp composition of officers and matching the current practice specifically around the chair of the board of County Commissioners being the chair of the Housing Authority board of directors and that is included uh in section seven of this article so article 3 section 7 specifically says that the chair and vice chair carryover from the board of Commissioners uh article four is the section on meetings there were big updates here um so that we were really describing our current practices around meetings special meetings the standard agenda um corrections to the times that we typically hold meetings um and updates to the agenda standard agenda structure and we also um included major updates to section n which is Communications around public just to bring it in line with how we currently do our public Communications process um public comment that sort of thing um so that is really the end of it uh articles 5 through 7 there were no major changes in those sections um they cover travel expenses and expense expens funds um and then the process for reapproved to the bylaws um so that uh that kind of covers it I will say that the last request was a a typo that we caught an extra comma in that first section we also uh I want to confirm that we also made that change um so I think that's it at this time we're we're happy to answer any questions commission members do you not commission Housing Authority Board of director members do you have any questions with regard to the proposal that is before us I have a quick question chair Harton I section four is about the secretary and it's under descriptions of officers um but the executive director isn't part of the composition as officers here but it is in a staff person how do we make that distinction do you mean can you say it can you ask question I can ask I can I think I understand what you're saying but can you ask again yeah I'll ask differently so when I think of board of directors the composition of what makes up the board of directors the officers I think the the document the bylaws say it very well but the description under secretary is about not a board member but a staff person so if a secretary normally under best practices is part of the board composition is one of the officers but the secretary in this section four is a staff commissioner fi uh members of the board it isn't an unusual for a staff member to be uh the secretary for a uh body and so um for example our um fair board is is the same way and that a staff member is a secretary so I think it's it's clearly permissible and not unusual yeah okay I think that's all the questions I have any other questions do we have a motion to adopt the resolution or approve the resolution in order uh on this matter for the bylaws and rules of adoption so mov we have a motion and a second all those in favor please raise your hand or I uh thank you I believe that was visually uh all seven of us clerk Moss confirmed thank you very much we'll move on to the second action item approve the pre-development contract and resolution in order in the matter of authorizing the executive director to form entities support applications for funding and and execute required project documents for a Metro Bond site acquisition project at 314 Southwest 209 I'll turn it over to M Rogers and the team good morning everyone again directors um I first actually just wanted to take a moment to thank express my appreciation for the reappointment of Mike savara last month or this just a few very recently um who spoke very eloquently at last week's Grant opening at the aloa saf rest Village pod director savara your service for another term will help guide the Housing Authority towards our next chapter as an organization you may not have known what your term was then but now you know what your term was with the bylaws um but we will be of course our next chapter is focusing on more affordable housing developments across the county completing the metro housing Bond project for Washington County and aligning our federal Resources with the support of Housing and services measure to best meet the needs of our community so thank you for your service I'm excited to introduce a project that best represents this next chapter for the Housing Authority fully supported by Metro and recently purchased by Metro site acquisition program thank you Metro for your partnership I will now turn the presentation over to Andrew kampton our development manager and Melissa Daly our development coordinator to discuss our pre-development activities for the future project located at 3140 Southwest 209th Avenue thanks Molly and and thank you um Board of Directors for having us here today today um in reviewing the uh aloa acquisition site I was going to two thank you so taking a step back um the Metro affordable housing Bond $652 million to the Metro region there was a 9010 split for for the um local implementation Partners receiving 90% and Washington County was allocated 118 million for that of the 10% administered by Metro's site acquisition program Washington County has allocated $12.9 million and when you look at the map that is to the right those unit counts are our local implementation strategy goals and the Metro acquisition site acquisition program units will be in addition to that this map shows the uh location of the site acquisition program properties that have been acquired by Metro through this program the 209th site is the last of the sites acquired by Metro it was purchased on January 12th just a couple month a couple weeks ago and it will also",

        "text": " local next slide please okay so this and you know the handouts have something similar to this it's in a little bit different format but it really talks about the same steps there are seven major steps in our review process and where we're at right now is you can see based upon the border on the very first one is we're at the very first step so we are at the very very early stages um and you know as you receive the notice and while you're here it's called the notice of intent it's not an application it's not a decision it's a notice of intent to apply for a project and so very very early and so what's required in that and if you've had a chance to review the notice of intent it's really desktop kind of level analysis this is not an in-depth evaluation yet it's really sort of desktop level work to basically tell us the department tell you you know members of the public and then the state agencies tribal governments and and local governments what the project is generally and where it's going to be um and that helps then us do an evaluation of that we look for comments from you all on that we see comments from Again State agencies local government local governments and tribal governments and what that does is it gives us enough information to establish the project order which is the next step on the the slide here and what the project order is is functionally a list of the specific requirements that this project has to meet now we have you know and I'll talk about standards in another slide but we have um each project could be very different in terms of you know not just the standards that are applied but how they're applied and so we look very carefully at the notice of intent we seek information from all kinds of different people to figure out what really is the um what do they have to submit in their application what level of review what are the potential impacts to the varying resources that they have to evaluate so the notice of intent is valid for two years so they submitted it March 6th um around there so once they submitted their notice of intent it's good for two years so it expires at two years and if they don't get an application in they'll have to resubmit the notice of intent um and I think yeah so in their notice of intent when was it oh it's October October of 2023 is when you said you're intending to submit the application yeah so the um in their notice of intent they've indicated the you know the intent to submit their application in October they don't have to they can wait all the way till you know the close to the end of two years so I think it's important to know that you know we're here now we're seeking public comment we're going to issue this project order but if you don't hear from us for you know another year and a half doesn't mean the Project's dead it just means they're putting together their application and they can still submit that application near the end of that comment or that uh that two-year time um one of the things in the slide that you can see so underneath the Chevrons you have these green boxes those are all where there are opportunities for public participation so our process includes numerous notifications numerous numerous opportunities for the public to participate in the process so this is just the first of several I won't get into the details of the next stages and how that works we can kind of talk about that you know the further this project gets along but it is important to note this is not the only time in fact you'll have you know if you're interested more opportunities numerous opportunities to participate next slide please so uh yeah so this slide includes uh the list of Standards so there are 16 standards um that are applicable to all projects and then there are some additional standards that are specific to certain types of projects so you can see on the bottom right hand side you have citing standards for transmission lines and the need standard that's specific to this project but you know if this was a win project or a solar project all of the other ones would be applicable as well um the way that our process works is that the applicant has the burden to prove it's a standards-based process they have to submit an application which meets these standards as we describe them in detail in the project order but it's their burden it's not our burden it's not your burdens their burden to meet to show that they meet all of these standards and that's based upon the evidence that's submitted in the record so again as we move along on this once they submit their application we'll review that we'll seek information from you know everybody as to did they get it right do they have enough information is there more information that you have that we don't have or the applicant doesn't have because ultimately they have to prove that they meet each one of these standards now if they do they will get an approval but if they don't then they'll get a denial that's entirely on them the burden of proof is on them next slide please so one of the elements of the notice of intent is the study area so what this slide shows this sort of conceptually the study area so the green center dot is say the project boundary I know it doesn't look like that but sort of imagine that that's the project boundary so in the notice of intent they have to evaluate at a desktop level certain resources and what are the potential impacts of this project to those resources so for historic and cultural and archaeological resources they have to look just within the site boundary or land use wildfire and Fish and Wildlife they have to look within the site boundary and then a half mile out so you can see the other standards how much farther they have to go in order to evaluate the potential impacts of the project now the reason I bring this up for you is because when we put together put together the project order we established what are called the analysis areas there you go you got it thank you thank you Wally yeah much better so analysis area it's it's essentially the same as the study area except that the amount of work that has to be put in for these analysis areas is much higher um if there is a significant natural resource area they have to go out and do on-site studies if there is the potential for uh subsurface archaeological resources they have to go out and do subsurface probes and probably we have monitors out there so the the amount of work can be quite extensive and quite expensive and so what we want to do is through this phase the notice of intent phase we want to hear from everybody to say are these correct you know based on what you know about historic and cultural and archaeological resources or protected areas or Scenic resources are these distances correct because then that's what we would establish as the work that they have to do to put together their application but it could be that these shrink down because of the project or they could expand because there's other resources out there that go just beyond these distances so again be thinking about that when you're reviewing the notice of intent and providing comments to us and then for me my last slide next slide go back there you go uh is land use so you know as I said our process is a standards-based process everybody every applicant has to meet the same set of Standards land use is a little bit different in that um the applicant can choose to have the local governments do the land use review so you know this project goes through a bunch of different jurisdictions so the applicant could actually not have the land use reviewed by the department and the energy facility citing Council they could go to each one of those local governments and whatever permitting project or permitting processes and reviews that they do they would do them they would run through their process and then ultimately that would sort of feed back into our process near the end at this point in their notice of intent the applicant has indicated they want the energy facility citing Council to conduct all of the land use reviews so that's what's in the notice of intent they can change their mind but they have to make that decision at the application stage so once they've submitted their application they're locked in but as I said as at this point in time they have intended or indicated their intent to have uh fsac review the local land use uh requirements so with that I'm going to turn it back over to Chris great and speaking to the next slide thank you um yeah so one of the unique features of an application for a transmission line project said the applicant's required to uh provide what's called a corridor selection assessment which basically explains what alternatives were considered and why they selected the route that they selected um as I mentioned uh earlier in the notice of intent um there is a single a corridor proposed for most of the line but there are multiple corridors proposed near the Western interconnection uh here in um we we do just want to to know that procedurally these the proposed quarters and the noi are subject to change and entirely different corridors could be proposed in the full application the applicant May propose adjustments in the application or they may propose them at these meetings um and also the applicant must consider any public comments that we receive on the noi and selecting the quarters for uh for full analysis in the application I did want to show if you could put the next slide please thank you um that the uh two uh or the corridors proposed and the Western interconnection are the proposed route would continue in the river uh up until about the midpoint of Hayden Island and then would be trenched across the island and installed underneath the north Portland Harbor area of the river using horizontal um the second option which is noted as option two on this map would come on land around Brown Beach uh and then would follow the right-of-way for Marine Drive to the uh the proposed converter station site um there's also a a two options proposed to connect the converter station site to the North Lombard Street right of way um and those are basically just different routes that would cross the Columbia slew uh and the Ramsey Wetlands um as I mentioned these corridors can change but right now this is what's proposed for the western side um we were in The Dalles last night so uh and next slide please um we did just want to show that the on uh land segment on the Eastern side of the line uh would come on to land around the Dallas Marina uh and the riverfront park there and then would be uninstalled under I-",

        "text": " throughout the remainder of the permitting process and as we move into construction and ultimately into the operational phase as well um as I mentioned Nikki is our U stakeholder relations lead and she'd be glad to meet you if we haven't had the chance to to connect with you already so going to spend a little bit of time on this slide um and some of this may be duplicative with what Chris already covered and uh apologies for that but we'll just run through it one more time so we began developing the project back in 2021 it was previously called bombing range solar and then Echo solar and we ultimately landed on Sunstone solar which is after the the state gemstone of Oregon uh we don't plan on changing the name again um this is is a solar generation facility with potential uh battery battery energy storage component as well the maximum facility output will be 1200 megaw the largest anticipated footprint will be acres and we're going to be interconnecting the project to existing infrastructure owned by umel Electric Co Co-op and Bonville power Administration uh so we'll have some maps to kind of point out those um points here in just a minute but um important just to note that the project is not going to require any new transmission corridors outside of the project boundary uh will be able to interconnect right on site and also that we will not be interconnecting the project to the proposed uh Boardman to Hemingway project even though we're in close proximity to that Corridor the project is expected to be constructed in phases over a period of about four years from 2026 to 2029 so we'll talk a little bit more about what that looks like when we get to those slides and once the project is interconnected and operating the power that's generated is going to flow uh to the umel Electric Co-op and and BPA Regional transmission systems and will help meet the rising demand for clean energy in this in this region also wanted to mention that we do have a a pilot agreement which stands for payment inl of tax um we negotiated that with Maro County a couple of years ago now uh and it provides for $7,000 per megawatt per year of payments to the county uh in lie of normal Taxation and that's for a period of 17 operational years uh for the balance of the 40-year life of the facility will be taxed under the the normal uh tax regime and when you model all of that out we anticipate that it will generate um $376 million to the county over the life of the facility so going to show three Maps here these are available in the application in in Exhibit C um first one is kind of all way zoomed out showing the site boundary inside the purple um located just on the Southeast corner of the bombing range and it's roughly halfway between Hepner and and Boardman great this map is a little more zoomed in and shows all of the existing and proposed energy facilities within a 10 mile U distance of the the site boundary so you can see there's a lot of um existing and proposed proposed wind and solar and other types of infrastructure in the area as well as a lot of existing and proposed transmission lines um so this project kind of fits right in into that mix in a corridor that's already pretty active with this type of development now all the way zoomed in to see the uh proposed facility layout um including the the site boundary some of the key components that Chris mentioned early on in his presentation in terms of fence lines om&amp;m areas lay down yards Etc uh we do have a copy of this map over here on the board if anyone wants to come over and take a look at it with us after the the presentation um the point of interconnection with the UE system will be in the northwest corner of the site uh if you see the dotted blue line coming down from North that's the existing transmission line that we'll physically connect the facility to and then uh there's a few areas marked in red that are excluded from development so there's a couple of tracks that the participating land owners are going to continue to farm uh there's the Sand Hollow area that runs north south kind of in the middle of the the proposed site and then a few other areas that are excluded as well um sorry just to mention as well um up in that northwest corner where we plan to interconnect the facility is likely where construction will start and as it's built out in phases it will sort of propagate from from there and get built out towards the the southeast um also sorry one more thing uh I mentioned the B2 the Boardman to Hemingway line Corridor which is proposed so that cuts through the the field all the way at the West it runs doe north south it then comes down and cuts through the the Project's um site kind of I don't know two thirs of the way down um be happy to point that out in more detail to anyone that wants to take a look at with at it with us afterwards but again just to reiterate we won't be interconnecting to that line that that line is essentially an obstacle for us that we're working around and and we'll um have some Crossing agreements to go in our need as so wanted to provide just a really quick rundown on how a solar facility works for folks that may not be familiar um so you can kind of follow this slide from left to right so starting with the sun obviously and then the solar modules or or panels as they're sometimes called are really the star of the show here um these are primarily silicon based uh technology about the size of a large TV screen and uh these days they actually collect sunlight on both the front and the back for a little extra juice on the back side and the output of the solar modules is DC electricity so that DC electricity is what ultimately uh feeds back into the inverters gets changed into AC electricity uh there's a couple of iterations of Transformers to step up the voltage to get it to match the uh the voltage of the transmission system that we're connecting to um the modules themselves will be mounted on steel racking which in this case we're proposing a single AIS tracking system so that racking will actually start out in the morning Facing East it'll rotate throughout the day end up facing west follow the sun maximize the production and then reset at the end of the day um I mentioned the potential battery storage components of the facility so more than likely those will sit on the AC side of the inverters and um will be designed to collect and store electricity that's generated by the facility so that it can be U dispatched on demand if a customer needs it at at a certain time um or potentially moved around during the day to to more accurately uh meet the demand in the region in the application we've proposed uh two different battery storage technology types one is lithium ion which is probably the most common technology in the market right now um we've also proposed a zinc air solution that has some benefits um but is a little bit of a newer technology uh Chris covered this a bit already but just to highlight again all of the studies that we're competed during the development phase of the project and are included in the application uh for example the Wetland delineation report is can be found in exhibit J attachment one economic impact analysis in exhibit K attachment 2 Etc so you can follow that list down and and um all of these studies are available inside the the application materials that are available on the FC alongside the studies we've also uh drafted a number of plans to address uh different impacts from the facility and different aspects of the construction and O and process uh I won't read all of these out to you but they touch on a number of themes from uh dust control weed control uh agricultural mitigation habitat mitigation construction traffic Wildfire mitigation Etc and again just following the same there that'll guide you to where you can find it inside the application so really throughout the development process of the facility so far we've been really focused on uh land use and sighting considerations and just to highlight a few of those that are described in in great detail the application particularly in exibit k um you know we've worked to site the facility near existing transmission lines and infrastructure like we talked about uh the footprint of the facility is pretty much exclusively located on land that's used for Dryland wheat production and it's all inside the uh Butter Creek uh critical groundwater area uh we've worked hard to make sure the proposed project will not impact or displace irrigated agricultural uses and we're working to preserve existing Area Water Resources as well lastly the facility's been designed to avoid what little high value wildlife habitat was um surveyed in the area and um you know we think we'll be able to completely avoid impacting those areas and if we do uh have to impact any there there's some um mitigation proposed with with a third party to address that so addition to in addition to the other impacts that I just mentioned um the impact on agricultural land has been a really key consideration this was identified early on in our engagement with local stakeholders as a key issue so we hired a third party firm called Northwest to do some pretty detailed economic modeling uh to determine the direct indirect and induced economic impacts that the facility may have on the local agricultural economy and then we took that information and we worked collaboratively with Maro County and with other um a stakeholders to come up with a pretty unique agricultural mitigation plan to address those impacts uh this includes the creation of a agriculture mitigation fund um and an agreement with Maro County to establish the fund and create an advisory committee to uh administer that and the idea is that when we start construction of the facility we will be committed to paying money into this fund um and that those funds will ultimately go to benefit um Dryland wheat uh projects in the county or um the agricultural economy more generally and lastly we have committed in our application to continue our engagement with uh neighbors around the project who may you know uh feel impacts from the facility when it comes to traffic or dust control or other things and want to make sure that we're taking their farming operations into account as we're planning for the uh construction and operation of our facility and make every accommodation we can to um avoid having those impacts Chris pretty much covered this already but just to point out again we're currently in the public information meeting phase of the permitting process here we anticipate receiving the site",

you give me also a thumbs up if you can see my slide presentation cool all well we're good to go good morning chair grail vice chair hal and members of the council for the record my name is chase mcvay walker and i'm a senior signing analyst at the oregon department of energy's sighting my presentation this morning is on agenda item e and it's your review of the proposed order on request for amendment 6 to the state line wind project site certificate it's also council review and decision um or review of any contested case uh requests received and we actually didn't receive any but i can get into i'll get into that more when i discuss procedural history for this presentation i will provide the council with the facility overview including a description of the approved facility location and site certificate then i'll discuss the specific procedural history on the request for amendment six following the procedural history i'll move into describing and discussing the changes that were incorporated between the draft proposed order and the proposed order including um well yeah based on comments received and council's review of the dpo and then i'll conclude my presentation by turning it over to counsel for final deliberation and a decision the state line wind project consists of two operational units with a combined peak generating capacity of 222 state line one and two which is one of the two units is composed of 186 wind turbines and has a peak generating capacity of up to 123 then sickle 2 the other unit of the two consists of 43 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 99 megawatts there are two certificate holders for the stateline wind project site certificate um based on the two geographic units of the facility as i just mentioned the certificate holder for state line one and two is fpl energy vancicle llc certificate holder for vancicle 2 the second unit is fpl energy state line 2 both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of nextera energy resources a few related or supporting facilities found at the facility itself include power collection system meteorological towers operations and maintenance buildings a substation an interconnection transmission line and permanent access roads state line facilities facility is located in umatilla county north and east of helix oregon council issued a site certificate for the statewide win project on september 14 2001 and that site certificate has subsequently been amended five times with the most recent amendment approved by council in may of 2019 and that particular amendment the fifth was um approved and included a name change from state line 3 to vancicle 2 and it also approved a repowering of the existing turbines and redevelopment of a temporary of temporary lay down areas and access reds now i'm going to provide you a summary of what was requested in request for amendment 6. request for amendment 6 which is specific to the vancicle 2 unit and therefore was submitted by fpl requests f6 approval again repowering the existing 43 wind the repowering would include replacing the blades in the nacelles resulting in an increase in maximum blade tip height from 440 feet to 499 the repowering would also reduce the minimum ground clearance from 85 feet down to 59 feet it would increase in hub height from 262 and a half feet to 295 feet and would also increase generating capacity from 2.3 megawatts to 2.66 megawatts at the existing 43 wind another component to this uh amendment request were a request for options to construct and for construction and operation one option was uh to decommission and replace up to four of the existing wind turbines and or construct up to two new turbines with maximum dimensions i just mentioned for a maximum total of 45 turbines by by replacing and also constructing new turbines that would potentially increase the generating capacity by 20 megawatts for vansicle 2 from 99 megawatts to 119 additionally the certificate holder has proposed to construct and operate a 50 megawatt battery energy storage system lastly the request for amendment would would result in approximately 210.9 yeah acres of temporary in 12.1 acres of permanent disturbance associated with proposed temporary road improvements and lay down areas on to the next slide this figure here represents the vinsicle 2 site boundary and existing turbine locations as well as the proposed replacement and new turbine the site boundary for vansicle 2 as uh identified here in this figure is the black and white uh hash mark line the uh the green triangles on this figure represent um the proposed repowered turbines to be repowered with amendment six the yellow triangles more so in the middle of this figure the replacement turbines and the red triangles these two red triangles the proposed new two new additional turbines um the teal turquoise line that uh shoots up to the northwest of this figure is representative of the overhead transmission line i think that's all i got on this and if anyone has any questions at any point please feel free to stop me now getting into the procedural history specific to this amendment request department received the preliminary request for amendment on july 23rd and following our review we deemed the amendment complete on november 17th and then received a complete request for amendment from the certificate holder on november 19th of 2021. on november 23rd the department issued it issued its dpo draft proposed order recommending that council approve rfa 6 request for amendment 6. on the same day the department also issued a notice of a public comment period on the amendment request and the the common period extended 23 days from november 23rd through the close of the uh public hearing on the dpl on december 16th however if you recall comment period was extended until 10 o'clock the following morning on december 17th in an effort to allow the certificate holder to respond to the oral testimony received during the hearing itself based upon well based upon our review of the comments received on the record of the dpo the department issued based upon our review the department's review of the comments received as well as council's review of the dpo the department issued the proposed order on december 21st along with the notice of of proposed order and notice of the contested case proceeding that applied to all of the individuals that commented on the record of the draft proposed order that notice uh established a deadline of 5 p.m on january 20th 2022 for submitting petitions requesting a contested case on the department's proposed order and as at the forefront of my presentation we didn't receive any requests for contested case so what we have in front of you today is the opportunity to review and evaluate the proposed order and make a decision based uh on the evidence provided and your statutory authority in the request for limit six of the stateline wind project site this slide summarizes the changes the department made to the dpo as provided in the proposed order which itself the proposed order was included as attachment 1 to the staff report for this agenda item agenda item e department amended one some of the changes the first bullet on the slide indicates that the department amended conditions based on council's review and comments on the dpl the department also updated findings in multiple sections based on council's review and comments on the dpl administrative updates were made to the introduction section and the amendment process section of the as represented in the proposed order additionally for the record the department would like to clarify today a misrepresentation found in both the staff report for agenda item and also in the proposed order in section two c of the proposed order council which is titled council's review the department uh well maybe i can just pull it up i think that would be the best way to show you what um my clarification of misrepresentation is let's see okay so this is on page 19 of the proposed order would like we recommend clarification be made um to the summary of comments received on the dpo regarding recommended condition and we recommend that council clarify that the two mile setback uh requirements apply solely to the two new turbines and that it wouldn't apply to the repowered and replacement wind turbines and so my recommended clarification would include what you see here in redline if you can see it um would just be a clarification half sentence and then down here revising to to clarify that it's not the uh wind turbines that the two miles is inapplicable to but rather they're re-powered so that was a mis misrepresentation and this was chase this is marcy may interrupt you for a moment sure i don't know if any i haven't pulled i'm looking at something i would just if you want somebody to look at it you're going to have to please try to make it larger if you want council members to actually see it okay thank you let me zoom in more i'm sure the record time just while he's doing that so this is one section of the um proposed order and this is just really a clarification i just want to put on the record that it's not a modification because in the land you section this is very well articulated um that the two-mile setback would only apply to the two new wind turbines and not the repowered turbine so that's already included it was included in the draft proposed order uh it's included in the proposed order that's not a change this is simply a clarification and i think the you know to be consistent so i just wanted to ensure council that this is not a modification it's just a clarification thank you thank you secretary clinton yeah what i meant to also add was yeah this no changes are recommended being made to the findings within the landing section just the upfront can you are you able to see this better chair grail yes okay i would recommend a clarification sentence be made clarify that the two mile setback would apply to the two proposed two new wind and then further down after this list new with repowered as it's not the it's as it's the repowered turbines and replacement wind turbines that the two-mile setback is inapplicable not the new what what page is that on this is on page 19 of the proposed order thank you i mean",

        "text": " them replacement of gas vehicles with electric vehicles and are we ready for that just relying on the market electric vehicles so those sort of we've always there's there's another one which is a you know affordable housing again this is one where it's more for us it's part of the tracking trying to figure out whether or not we're actually going to get through incentives what we plan that seems to be something that comes from a very good process uh not necessarily something there so I you know we've got solar design we've got the local Pathways together things that that I can remember other people bringing up necessarily characterizing I mean the specificity that other people I think we could go through those and then that could and that means that if they are a priorities to me that means that we've got Commissioners that are interested in those and that we could organize uh you know some committee fashion to figure out the best ways to approach them and work with staff on how to do that and then how to work and maybe more games that's a great approach that let's have that conversation because I'm hearing from everybody in the conversation about Hardware usage appropriate to do but just for a historical perspective the um our members um commissioner McKinley Vice President McKinley and he um six years ago seven or six years ago had the same sort of earnest interest in education youth involving them in government involving the Planning Commission so um he formed subcommittee the result end result was a new City flag so we had somebody at the charge he was willing to do that work outside of Staff time and he plowed it through so we've done this before but I think it's a great idea to set priorities so what are what are people's priorities by the solar I'm only here for seven more minutes we'll go each month when she starts later sure uh yeah so I'm interested in renewable energy resources I'm interested in renewable energy resources and other technologies that are going to allow us to reduce energy consumption such as heat pumps and things like that it's really interested in how do we expand the footprint of that in our city program I'm just going to go down the line just like yeah I'm interested in Wetland reservation and stream protection it's the biodiversity in those places is just incredible and they're so easily spoiled with runoff you know things like that so that's that's where I um I'll be definitely interested in looking into solar War as well that has something to do with Slaters topic as well so we can kind of join those together I don't think yeah I'll Echo all of that I think it ties into you know again creating these uh communities is largely based around access to uh amenities that improve your lives and that you know it largely equates to open spaces and reportable energy and sustainable energy so in addition to that I would like to see a mechanism for us to encourage a higher standard of design frankly which I recognize as that being said just within my own profession with my own experience there are uh there are standards that can be met and implemented through and I know we do have a design review standards for certain areas throughout the city but uh I think that those could be expanded in such a way that really does start to to kind of craft that a community that encourages you know pride and place for people very uh you know the creating streets that are that are heavily treed and have all of the different elements that that we find in often or affluent spaces and you don't want to start having a even neighborhoods that are not getting the same level of development based around simply the the code required minimums which is typically how codes work it's it's a minimum it's not it's not the encouraged and hopeful so there's a way to do that and just to reiterate that my experience working in other jurisdictions that have these sort of layered on additional review processes through uh you know pedestrian oriented design standards or uh you know lead level expectations for for building design I think that those are all very viable opportunities that we can that we can use as a commission to say you know show is your best that's released so I'm hearing you say like all of the above plus interested in looking at our design standards yes I would like to look at design standards that are that are not just the kind of basic building elements but how do those elements actually benefit the community that the building is going into thank you I understand it listening to folks and try to raise the you to my own so I I think that the list for me would taught that list would be the solar reading for energy sure how to characterize it but that the energy is footprint and to me that would include to include any of these as well the biodiversity of wetlands is Immunology that's that's critical I mean I think it is critical and it's all consumptive we run across but I'm not sure I understand very well now it's actually a process I know there's an inventory in this um other science could it it seems like we're always trying to figure out those issues but to me that moves into the open space issues as well um and the other one I would just characterize as science kind of designed for amenities for Olympic neighborhoods which includes um not my walkable neighborhoods includes trees includes the Open Spaces Community spaces it includes a lot of stuff which would require some uh further narrowing down but as I hear this I seem to think that there are the there are three areas that Loosely characterized as energy and um energy related issues we had some priorities for me because of the public utility background I know one of the baby issues for just general energy Supply if we're talking about getting rid of thank you Richard you can look at Portland General Electric sandwiches there's a big component there which are distributed um that includes Community solar uh and included and so design um design issues related to solar mode I think we've really explored that the way that you can so this just from what I'm hearing people say in my own I don't you know I characterize it as it is the energy component the component and the amenities component for local neighborhoods um it seems to be broadly stated this the topics of importance that I hear from people so basically it sounds like we have three for looking at science standards as an element so we're renewable and then the biodiversity and so to go up three priorities I I just want to compliment how well organized we are seeing like 30 minutes we've been prioritized the group that governance experiences I think what we can do with the Strategic plan yeah just to follow up a little bit on energy gap and thinking that maybe what we need in the long run is um an energy master plan versus energy assistance plan for sale on that might be as we think about these layers of comprehensive plan energy might be one of those layers that we just gave a parts has to plan this is communication system after that because it is going to become a significant issue as we move through electricity integrated under stress and I'm very sure we didn't see the sort of issues with fire uh so and it's gonna be interesting to see what the state comes out with legislatively yeah so a lot of our creative thinking might be just told to us I think also that you know there are some grants that um million dollar grants from planning Lisa was talking about a one of our previous meetings for Community solar and natural resiliency the statuses the climate change staff person whether we actually have someone or whether we're waiting on a budget decision for a person dedicated to that or not but in the inspiration of this broad energy and renewable energy one of the things would be this does not happen without collaboration with City Utilities and it would be interesting to know what with the status of that is um it probably would be informing us to know what teaches plans are what they're sitting book at a program under a year or so ago and they've got some deadlines by which they have to a completely renewable in their plan requires a lot of distributed these other programs I think these are things that would be good for us to at least know about if not as it started these are three big chunks so I don't know but we can set our priorities but then within the priorities do you set the number one priority and just drive that and see how um move forward with one priority to see how we manage that how do we gather information and how to distill the information or do you want to attack all three at the same time sure I think you've got to learn pictures I think that sort of depends on us if care if any one of these three someone wants to take the lead on I think they uh to be able to do it because I think there's enough interest at least those here it seems like these these are not diverging things that they're all interested in and it might be that if some one or two people want to take the uh on um how we might address that or what information you might want to try and get to start with but I think that would be fine because otherwise some people have more expertise in other areas or interested with expertise is background and if we just focus set one priority and focused on it sort of their expertise in that interest that works with the side three people willing to be leads yes yeah I mean it's up to us yeah I'm just saying that if there's people that are interested in London right a concerned if we just say we're only going to pick one and that's all we're going to work I didn't want to ask the Slater to do all three I thought you'd kill me so I thought maybe about other digital Gary and Bruce my thought is that we could we could certainly invite people from different fields and have hearings and information sessions as long as what we're doing is that we're ranking any of the best estabs in terms of work that seems to be where we have to be bought home about and ensure that you know these they all don't Peak at the same time they can put at the bottom of the bucket list for it's a successor to handle in 2050. I gave her a long time here commissioner Bob to that effect um I think it might be a good approach to to have you know set a deadline so we have maybe two months or whatever maybe to put together a kind of an outline of what what the priority is how you see it moving forward you know what that those kind of action items would be uh just and then present that as a plan that",

        "text": " see you guys anymore um just shout out if there's any questions shall we say because I would rather have this kind of be sort of iterative and not we saved the questions for the end it might get a little lost in some of the details okay so we already went over there we have a question from Laura Feldman yeah Michael quickly in your slides I saw that you held a public meeting in Richland last April last year in April I don't remember that but that's not too surprising I just wonder um how was that incorporated into this oh thank you that is a really good point um and sorry there's a lot of details that you know kind of get left out in a short presentation um we had part of the Congressional mandate was a 60-day public comment period so we had 60 days um where people could submit their public comments and we did hear from a number of the tribal Nations if not in um the the Yakima Nation was give a nice presentation at the meeting before that we heard from the Umatilla and the Nez Pierce all those comments were submitted to us as public comments they're opportunity to respond to those public I imagine that we did the ohc of the our board also probably commented too right oh yes yes well the ohcb itself did not well we as staff did yeah okay right right Jeff per right um I think actually was in Richland and gave a presentation at that time and uh either later in this presentation Michael or in my talks later today or again Odo has been involved in this since the beginning and uh have been invited so yeah we've been commenting all right thank you this has been a very compressed time frame I mean I don't know any other National academies committee that is expected to give three reports on three reviews in 18 months and so during the last meeting in Richland the report from the ffrdc was only released uh yeah roughly two weeks before the meeting and so um Washington and Oregon both were represented but it's tough when you don't we only have 10 days to read a report that's 800 pages long and respond to it so with the added link to this study over the summer and the fall we expect to be some more extensive responses you know where people could um you know sit down and sort of digest the but yeah thanks for pointing that out so we did have a public comments in the public comments are included in our um oops okay okay I'm back to where I and too many words on these slides um so this is sort of this is sort of a summary of what I just kind of said we received the report April 12th we had our meeting the 26th to the 28th um I hopefully I said this before many of the findings complement the team on all the work they did in the analysis and we're trying to advise them on how to improve the report and make that message a little bit um more receptive to you know stakeholders and decision makers and so we did come up with uh 13 um and finding to support those recommendations and so I'm going to go out on another limb um I'm going to give you the list of recommend I'm going to go through the um the recommendations based on sort of their um how they floated to the surface in discussions with the ffrdc and so some are a little bit more important to them and then some I mean sometimes some of them are actually you know just stylistic you know some of these graphs we don't understand um so some of that is also in there but so this is sort of you know the level that you know they thought was pretty key to sort of them moving forward to improving their report um and full disclosure this is a chemical engineering's view we have a lot of lawyers on our committee um that might get kind of give it have a different discussion so one of the main uh recommendations is it's just gonna get complicated uh the recommendation to discuss at the ffrdc gave a recommendation on um in their and that recommendation was to take sort of a multi-pronged approach to for on-site and off-site grouting with on-site and off-site um storage and so the F if you remember from their report they weren't really expected to make a recommendation but behind the scenes there was this expectation that they will be making a recommendation um for the decision makers and so our recommendation was you know it's we see why a recommendation was made and we just we just decided that the ffrdc needed to put a little bit more clarity on how they came to his recommendations um they're just their decision tree process is a little sort of uh befuddled um in about 200 and I think 120 page appendix on how they made these and so I guess we're just asking for a little bit more transparency on how they came to these recommendations and this is going to come up a couple um the um the ffrdc when it came to um Regulatory and public acceptance they were sort of uncomfortable with that that criteria is really hard um I think from my point of view public acceptance and Regulatory um and working with the regulatory groups is going to be an outcome of this process so it would be hard for them to predict the public acceptance of the regulatory um while they're going through the Alternatives and so this this will come up as a point a little bit later it's hard to have any discussion without discussing tank Integrity you know what happened what were the Alternatives uh change or the timeline slip or the cost um become effective if there's a double Shell tank failure and so the the ffrdc states that um there may not be significant changes if um if one if some of the tanks be um weren't available during the um sort of timeline of the Hanford process for removing the waste from those tanks um and again this didn't fall they weren't asked to look at this um and so there was no analysis from um and we recognized that the analysis is going to need to come either through a congressional mandate or from the Department of energy office of river protection so what we asked them to do is just to sort of send the reader in the direction of where the reports are that can discuss the double shell tanks and there's some excellent reports from um and even I this some of the um uh work they did for Ecology looking at Emmett gets us backwards system nine system nine scenario five or system I think it's something like they have reports that I can send you those reports and you know what happens to their timeline in case there's a double cell things aren't available another high level thing that came we're part of our discussion was this question is offside and onside and off-site uh storage and transportation and so what uh we sort of asked them to look at was one of their Alternatives is on-site um transportation disposal and they did a cost analysis and we just asked them to kind of separate out the two you know they did the off-site and then they did on-site off-site and so it was just there's that third piece you know from an economic um cost point of view what if it was just on-site and so we just kind of asked them to uh call that out um and then part of this uh public acceptance and Regulatory you know there's a and this this comes up quite a bit um especially with um you know talking with uh stakeholders is this uh idea of Orphan waste um what if you know they they select a site in Utah or Texas for off-site storage and then for some reason that off-site location isn't available um or uh the transportation to get it there is um isn't um I'll throw out cost effective but you know it could be it could be other things other than just um and so one of our recommendations was for the ffrdc to go back and just sort of discuss some of the impediments to onside and off-site storage and you know how to sort of how they're thinking about how they how these impediments should be thought of in case they um do happen uh uh but I thought I forgot to sort of lay out how these are these we categorize these and so that these are these a B's and C's and so the delayed sort of um fitrication was a c and so so the committee felt that somewhere in the analysis if there's a delayed date for vitrification there could be um there's there could be added costs and um and so this wasn't specifically called that and we just asked them to sort of look at this as a um as a possibility included in some some of their timelines and I sort of already discussed this this is our recommendation today and this um this idea of orphaned ways and so this is kind of a I mean I personally I feel like this is a tricky conversation you know how do you how do you discuss I mean we're you know over the next 30 to 40 years you know how do you discuss the availability of someplace out of state probably Utah to um maybe Nevada um New Mexico um how do you discuss what will happen if those sites become unavailable um and so this is Eartha the report was written to assume that these sites are available and the committee just wants further discussion about that you know what would happen if they do become um so I I think I already brought this point up um they have some specific issues on offside off-site treatment in our um again the difference between onside and off-site put forward as one of their recommendations the recommendation was off-site or off-site and off-site transition to on-site so from an engineering a cost and um and timeline we just asked them to separate out those um so we had on-site off-site and then purely off-site and just helped help us to make this budget the business case you know um what would be the most appropriate um path forward uh Transportation uh again this was this is back to the off-site disposal transportation we came in issue and that was kind of presented in the report as sort of very straightforward um we've done this before we know how to do it again and also it's part of the transportation discussion is transporting um um ways from the tanks off-site and what I guess I'm not quite sure who this falls on I'm gonna say dot but maybe NRC or the transporting of waste you know there's um you",

        "text": " is doing that would be great but as you know as you can see we're already pretty far down the road so you know unless unless we had it on good authority that that could happen and we could give them an IOU for next session I just I just don't see how any of that would work out so I I agree with you I think you're right I think that what happens with this Hub will be skewed towards Washington um they put up the money they created the organization um I think that for that reason it's incumbent upon Oregon to try to push back as much as possible to find that opportunity for for true um but you know I I if if Oregon stakeholders have concerns about how this is going and you know maybe start to to decide that they wish to to go in on on their own or form their own group I think that always within the realm of possibility you know Odo with respect to leadership um we're just not we're not you know currently staffed to I think be able to take on leading leading something like that we don't have the funding that Washington did to go out and hire a contractor with experience doing a multi-million dollar um funding proposal to the federal um I just I don't see that as a possibility I think that certainly Odo could be a part of something but I think it would be a really tall order you know unless you know if you know if there were direction from the governor or the legislature then obviously that would be different Rebecca if I could add this um I think there's one other leg to that stool which is Washington state has developed a pretty robust strategy for what their future energy State needs to look like and when it comes to hydrogen I think that there's there's not a consistent message that we could put out that this is what Oregon is looking for in our future energy State and so that's another area where I think it makes it a little more difficult for Oregon to move forward and take that leadership role to figure out how we could be the bring a great part of that Hub to the Pacific Northwest so I think there are a number of legs that could uh I'm totally mixing my metaphors but uh hopefully it's making sense thank you Jessica Evan I see Evan's hand yeah thanks um just you know I wanted to highlight that while Washington may be ahead you know in terms of allocating some funds from the state and have some having some supportive legislative policies it's by no means too late for Oregon to to get involved or to be a part of this Hub um you know the uh the pnha organization that was created in Washington went through uh some last minute changes and you know I want to remind folks that this Hub is is going to be led by the private sector you know we are talking about multi-billion dollar Investments being made that uh the match funding and those Investments are not coming from government they're coming from the private sector and so that's why pnha was set up as a public private entity so while Oregon as a government might not have as many goals or strategies in place we still have an opportunity to you know have the private sector step in and play a big role here and so um what government can do is you know work towards these goals and collaborate with the private sector to you know catch up to where Washington is and I don't think that's unreasonable in what Jillian put in the chat here is doe has forecasted this Hub timeline to be possibly an eight to ten year timeline so we are just getting started now and if we're a little bit behind you know we shouldn't feel um discouraged that we're out of the running to to do something meaningful in this state thank you Evan that was very um it was very glass half full I appreciate that and you know one one last comment too you know the The Hub is not the the be-all end-all of the hydrogen opportunity you know Oregon could go through this Hub process and you know get goose egg with zero funding directed into the state but now that we have the the IRA supporting clean hydrogen um you know there are many more opportunities today than there were even a few months ago and so we can still march forward in this Direction with or without Hub support and and still be Evan I'm so glad that you that you added that because you know our vision for Gathering all of you together and other interested stakeholders in Oregon is that this isn't only for the Hub opportunity you know Washington was relatively more organized you know it's stakeholders because they start you know kind of already been talking about hydrogen they knew kind of who the players were so this is overall our opportunity to become highly organized for the Hub opportunity but beyond it and so that kind of goes into another question that I had for everyone here is you know as as this convening of stakeholders that that was envisioned between business Oregon and Otto you know would love to hear more about what your ideas for what your ideas are for how this can be you know maximally useful and you know as part of that we're certainly trying to be complementary to other efforts that are happening you know renewable hydrogen Association is here today they're going to be doing some convening as well we've been working with uh blue green Alliance on some convenings with Labor uh so we're certainly trying to uh also collaborate with other groups in the space doing similar work to make sure that we're not duplicating effort but beyond that is this the sort of thing that you know we've had a great meeting today I can put together some you know some some material for Odo that we can then go to the association with and get feedback on and I can come back to you and report back and we can be on our way or we could you know make this a semi-regular meeting we could have you know subcommittees focused on specific parts of the application and and or on specific parts of dealing with the association that you know we have concerns and ideas around you know really I there's no there's no kind of single um you know that we've that we've lit upon we really wanted to come today and ask you what what Odo and business Oregon could do with this convening and what you'd like to see and how we can best meet your needs for organization and information flow and and you know sending feedback back to the association but then also beyond that to just hydrogen in general so you know if you have thoughts on that today I'd love to hear them if you want to follow up you want to think about it and follow up with me great too but you know that's really I would very much love to hear your thoughts on that one hey Rebecca um as people ponder that question uh there was one final question in the last subject from Chris um at Northwest Natural and he asked uh Hub awards are likely going to be highly political how plugged in is the Oregon delegation in this effort and do you know how plugged in the Washington delegations by chance and then um if you do want to answer Rebecca's current question about how uh Odo can help continue the conversation around hydrogen in general uh throw your hand up or put it in the in the question um in the chat and I'll happily organize that and Evan I don't know if you're hands up for this new discussion or if it's just from the last one so great um Chris's question um that's a great question Chris you know I don't have um a lot of insight into that um I certainly certainly not about what's going on with the Washington um you know I I Odo has not had any communication with um with the Oregon delegation if anyone here has and wants to talk about about it that would be certainly great but otherwise that's definitely an area that we could add for ER of information and a Matchmaker between possible Partners in the hydrogen space uh it would be helpful to have visibility into some of the other projects happening in the region and how we can learn from them or partner with them as appropriate great thank you Kelly I'm not seeing any other hands raised or questions in the chat Martina posted a comment regarding your question about moving forward I believe it would be helpful for the sector to have a regular interagency meeting or have regular interagency meetings to make sure various agencies communicate and are up to date and Thomas says first I had heard that how this is the first I'd heard that the Hub will likely be focused on Transportation it makes sense as it can be a near-term volume market for recently produced hydrogen I'm still perplexed that there is not representation for transportation on the executive board Maritime transit or heavy duty Freight um and Jillian uh concurred with that statement at times and now I see Thomas's hand is up so then he wants to add to that uh-oh Thomas you're um your voice is a little high it might be an issue with your speaker am I the only one having that problem no in all honesty Thomas sounds like a chipmunk speed is out though I don't know what's going on Thomas but I can't hear or understand anything Thomas is going to log out and come back in okay sorry about that while he's doing that I don't see any other hands raised any comments at the moment hi yes can you hear me all right great so this is Jillian from the Oregon Department of Transportation thank you Rebecca and Jessica for having this meeting I just want to get back to your question about next steps here and and say that I agree with with what both Kelly and Martina put in the chat I think Odo is a natural convener in this um and that I I do want to just highlight that there are other opportunities beyond the hydrogen Hub like if we go back to the infrastructure investment in jobs act there's section 11401 grants um that's something Oda as an agency is is heavily focused on obviously it's Transportation focused but we're going to be looking for partners and looking to uh generate some Grant Concepts there so having some sort of communication among all stakeholders uh in the state to to just start having these conversations about potential grant opportunities and how we can work together and partner um would be great and I think if if Odo can can lead that effort we would certainly welcome that and also just add back to my other comment too about if if they do release this hydrogen Hub funding in multiple rounds that's a natural Next Step as well as how can we be more",

        "text": " more so as the you know we have evaluations have to be done on some frequency you know and they always estimate this is the amount that we're going to produce over a 30-year time frame then they make that payment we do the calculations but if then at the next time they've increased the amount of production then that typically means that they will exceed the 30-year amount that they've provided not to provide an addition of the human so that's the wall it's working on right now with all projects uh councilman how did you have a question I do the um just for instance Eugene to Medford so I'm presuming that the certificate holder knows the conditions and was were these um this evidence do sometime before 10 13. and they didn't provide it and sent out now this is a reminder that we need to have it by this date yeah so do you find that certificate holders are well aware you don't have a kind of a run book you know I need to provide this report by October 1st or do you know how they're managing these yeah so the way that it works with um just about every site certificate holder is by April 30th of every year they have to provide an annual report of the prior calendar year okay and so in that they you know whether whatever phase they're at they have to basically be looked at and evaluating whether they're adhering to all the conditions so we're kind of in the process of retooling that um you know what they submit what we ask them to submit to us so we can better evaluate it so that we're making sure that they're looking at it that we go through the details of it and making sure you know condition by condition that all of those are currently being met so what I would say is we're um we're kind of in the middle of a transition right now and so the short answer is yes they should be aware of it they should have met that yeah they didn't and so we're going through that and making sure that you know they have a process by which they're clearly evaluating all of the applicable conditions that should be met during that prior calendar year uh you know in the best case scenario is when we sit down either in person or doing a kind of an online audit with them that everything will have been submitted and everything will be good and clear that's where we want to get to and these incidences that were or you know these these sort of conditions where which aren't being fully met hoping next year we will not see that thank you yes and yes uh oh yeah good question and like I said that one will likely be at the next council meeting now once we had a chance to look at the proposed changes that the portal tomorrow has made next slide please uh in the next one okay last two are incidences that we were notified of and the first is big old Canyon um where this is an energy facility uh there was an oil spill involving two pad mounted Transformers similar to you know what we've heard about before with the same facility so these are additional I think the reason why was maybe a little bit um so each of the Transformers contain approximately 486 gallons of non-pc8 mineral oil the oil was released onto the gravel pads so it didn't extend out to kind of the farm fields or anything no water has been impacted associated with the PG is contracted with uh NRC U.S ecology to assist the cleanup this was also reported to DEQ and then so the failures with these um were based upon an electrical fault in The Collector line so they were doing some testing associated with the electrical collector lines those collector lines you know as they sound connecting to the wind turbines to each other and then those um go move to like a ramp up station and so why it happened we don't know but it was part of that testing of those transmission lines that resulted in those two Transformer failures uh in Wellsville so that turbine string has been shut down the time being when as they're doing an evaluation so just received this uh is it either this week or I think it was yeah it was very recent so we don't have any further details on it and next one is cardi Generating Station so this is a natural gas power plant uh also a PGM facility so they received a um that was could was or could be construed as a potential bomb threat so their security kind of detail at PGE notified Laurel County Sheriff's Office the Federal Bureau of Education other investigations Oregon public utility commissions and RC West which is the reliability coordinator for the western United States balancing authorities and and the north North American Electric reliability Corporation nerve so you may have seen articles there's been some hot shots at some facilities and I as we've heard this was only one of the facilities that received a similar type of bomb threats so they reported to that up to us there's really probably nothing we're going to do about it but they did report us to be aware of why this is Marcy what I would say about that is I personally believe these will continue going forward and it might be something that is um we the body weight obligations that would really the city security and what your plans are around your management and given some of the safety I think it's going to continue happening because that's just the world we're in right now and last on my list is the next council meeting January 19th and 20th so we are at this point pretty confident uh I would say 100 but but pretty pretty confident that we're going to need to have a meeting it will need to be in Condon if we do have the meeting and that will result in a a Thursday night public hearing and then a Friday regular council meeting so we'll verify that early next week just to make sure uh but as I said right now we believe that that will be the case so this is Marcy Kent um might need you to start the meeting off on Thursday I'm going to have to fly back from uh Vegas where I've got to help them out for traffic and there's I'm the only one from my local that's on it so I can't miss it um so depending on how that goes I will land and drive fast the January 19th and 20th so you know we've because it's hard to predict weather at this point in time um so this would be the the trigger for this meeting in this location would be uh draft post order uh hearing on an amendment there is a in-person in vicinity requirement um not by Statute but by council's rules but if you recall I don't know a year year and a half ago Council also um made changes to the rules to allow for a kind of good cause uh waiver of that so if you know two days before the meeting you know it's blizzard conditions then the council could make the choice to hold that uh remotely only so but because it's so far out there's no way we can predict and forecast the weather of any kind of accuracy so if we decide we're going to have the meeting we will you know send it out be um forecasted to be in that location and then we would just keep an eye on the weather and make sure that the safety travel Department um it is the Oregon Trail solar um they have submitted a request for amendment to extend uh beginning construction timeline and that was uh if you recall that was Montag wind this is one of the projects where there's been a lot of changes to montaguin had an amendment to add solar and then that was subsequently split into multiple facilities so this is kind of a progeny of the Montag or Wind but it's currently just a actually solar and wind so it has two components that they could build ask us any questions that concludes my extra long Council secretary report thank you thank you next item on the agenda is agenda Item B this is the state line win project transfer Amendment request uh this is adhering and action item um I caredale will be acting as a hearing officer and the council is going to conduct the hearing on a request to transfer ownership from the state line when project site certificate from FPL energies Dateline to incorporate it it's Advanced Circle to win generation facility the purpose of the transfer hearing is to provide the public an opportunity to provide oral comments on the transitory request and applicable Council standards specifically organizational expertise and retirement and financial Assurance to council so the time is now 9 19 and I'd like to open the transfer hearing on a request for amendment to transfer certificate order ownership of the state line win project site certificate from FPL energy state line two Incorporated to Van Sickle to win testimony of this hearing must be limited to the request for transfer or the evaluation of the new owner's ability to satisfy the requirements under the council's organizational expertise standard retirement and financial Assurance standard was sent in a composed order is the new owner available and do they wish to provide comments or to testify yes sir if we might I think we probably set this up a little bit off anywhere probably helpful for Council and and those uh listening to get a brief overview of what the project is and what the request is um so my apologies for no setting this up a little bit Sarah thank you so much good morning we just have a brief intro won't take too um again my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy advisor in the Oregon Department of energy siting Division I would also just like to announce in the room today we have representatives from the state language project including David Waller and their resident and State Attorney from stole Reeves Miss Sarah Stover hurt us as chair Grail has already mentioned this agenda item will include three parts I'll do a brief overview first of the facility and the amendment request and then chair Fair will open a hearing on the transfer request after that concludes then we will go through your review of the transfer request and any issues raised on record so our overview this transfer request applies to the state line win project site certificate this site certificate is a little unique in that it does include two certificate holders and within the site certificate itself it allocates facility components into two the units are separated by geography and they have names and site certificates State Line one and two is one unit name and then Van Sickle two is another nickname and then the site certificate includes separate and distinct conditions for these two and then assigns the certificate holders to each of one of",

        "text": " so I have some concern about that um our last public meeting we talked quite a bit about wildfire mitigation plans and um striving for a more cohesive um approach so that we see these plans becoming um just better I guess in general um and also um better you know more frequent inspections and I did see in this one that they had actually put that information in there so that's um but again um also want to reiterate that um you know speaking with the First Responders in this area is really really important um all those fire districts that are impacted by this project um reaching out to them and um also you know what their capacity levels are and how are they going to respond to the fire when it happens because it will happen um we need to know that they have been engaged um and that and what their comments are because we don't ever get to hear from or from what I gather so far I haven't heard from any local fire responders um to these matters so I'm very curious about that and um also wanted to ask this is more of a question and I'm not sure who can answer it but um I noticed that the comment period was different on this than the one that we just had it was 30 days versus 45 days and again I'm new here so I'm still learning what constitutes a 30-day review versus a 45 day review or comment period I should say not review and um if this was an expedited process so I'm thinking maybe that might be it thank you secretary cornette for the record Todd cornette I can certainly take the last one um so I believe the minimum comment period is 21 days so that's the legal requirement for a draft proposal or comment I have to go back and verify that but I think that's probably correct um beyond that we we never said a 21 day or I I doubt that we've ever said a 21 day because don't believe that's sufficient to review the complete application or the complete request for Amendment and a draft proposed order um but frankly it's a judgment call on staff's part based upon the proposed project location what we've known to date about interest on that project Bo been to Heming way a lot of interest therefore it was you know going to be a minimum of 45 days because that's you know based on our experience we know that there's a lot of interest um and we wanted to make sure people had that opportunity for this project um at the public information meeting on the notice of intent at the public information meeting on the complete application there was very limited um interest uh limited participation that doesn't necessarily mean that at the draft proposed order stage there would be that same limited participation but it's likely um and so that's essentially why we chose a lesser time frame than the Boardman the Hemingway way any other comments questions Vice chair Condon um thank you Cindy conon for the record and I forgot I did have a question on the Wildfire um mitigation and I I should have um checked on this um it's my memory that the Wildfire standard is on ignition it it kind of uh applies to ignition Source the the project being an ignition source because you mentioned grassland is more um of a problem for fire than the solar facility um it jogged my memory and I'm just curious in any of the Wildfire mitigation plans that we're looking at or whatnot are is there a I haven't seen and I know I've asked about it before a notification process for adjacent land owners should there be an ignition on a project is that anticipated in the plan in mitigation plans I just don't know about about the development of those plans thank you uh Vice chair Condon this is Sarah esterson senior policy adviser for the record um I think that what we're trying to ensure is included in Wildfire mitigation plans is an obligation to develop a process for working with emergency responders to notify local land owners but that the obligation wouldn't be for the certificate holder the facility Personnel to do that notification so we haven't because we don't actually have any Wildfire mitigation plans that have been finalized or are in place we're not seeing what that actually looks like what is the process they've developed but the plans say you've got to develop a process thank you and I I know you've been working on it and so just as that developed through the process I'm interested in in um adjacent property owners and the protection of their property in timely I mean ambers do fly pretty quickly and so what are the mitigation efforts for those adjacent so I'm was just looking for that information thank you no problem counc berer Vice chair Conan I think we added a condition to the obsidian project one of the Amendments that we've been trying to include on other um projects for that coordination with the local responders knowing that the local responders probably have better access to property records than the developer would and would have a system perhaps in place um to notify by those adjacent Property Owners I know in dutes County you can get text alerts for Wildfire smoke uh you know all sorts of police activities so there are different mechanisms to do those property owner notifications and I think as we start to see mitigation plans maybe there'll be a model that other developers can adopt but we want to make sure that that language is in every condition we put under the Wildfire standards that we expect that coordination just a follow up to that and yes I do remember that we talked about it and had it as a condition it's just as we see more and more plans I'd like developers to think about about okay what's our responsibility for it because like I said the Embers travel quickly and I I don't know what the what the timing for even knowledge of an incident and then now um engaging with the local fire I just um I don't know enough about it yeah thanks and there's a there's a potential for at least one potentially three in the next six months where we would actually see the outcome of what this means what is the plan for that landowner communication and we can bring that back to you thank you Council Devin this is a very general questions chairman maybe just that Mike I'm waiting I've been noticing I mean I believe the developers are very cognizant of the fire issues but I've been seeing in the last probably year and a half more of the proposals coming in with more of the potential some of them are not transmission lines but power lines being underground compared to uh proposal from a couple years back is are you generally seeing that and I mean I think that's a recognition of the the way to to minimize the chances of fire is to put power lines underground particularly given what litigation there's been in western states on this issue well I don't want to speak for next era but I thought that they actually have a policy for 34.5 KV lines that are there underground um we haven't dealt with high voltage underground proposals yet yeah I was seeing more lines big fo change any other comments okay um as previously stated the comment deadline is June 7th at 5:00 pm the applicant will be given until Monday June 10th at 5:00 pm Pacific time to provide responses to comments however if requested by the certificate holder the department is authorized to grant them additional time to respond does the applicant wish to provide any responses tonight yes sir thank you for the opportunity again this is Ryan Hill with the wagon trail solar project um and could you go ahead and go to slide 15 that I uh sent over earlier yeah slide5 I just kind of want to address some of the uh comments brought up tonight sorry let me get logged in here um and just kind of talk through our thinking specifically on the go three uh exception but to kind of answer some other things right our noxious weed plan our fire mitigation plan those are living documents right so we we update those when there's a new piece of information and you know a larger company like my parent company NeXT D energy resources uh we're going through pre-construction compliance of a a wind project also in Morrow County and so all the lessons learn that we get from that noxious weed mitigation plan fire mitigation plan we we bring to our other projects as well so while you might not have seen those changes for this specific project they are coming um additionally I walked through with the mo County Emergency manager this week with our operating site right just to get his input on our operating facility what we could do better his input the coordination with the local First Responders and then we went a step further where we brought in our construction superintendents to talk about hey what are we doing during construction what can we do better you know how are we going to coordinate with the county if there is an emergency whether it's fire related or a personal injury you know working out all those details um and then Additionally you know he get to see up close and personal you know a battery storage system as well as solar panels and and wind turbin so I think it was a good experience for him and so we are doing that coordination and you know sometimes all of these plans are pretty detailed but it's hard to include every little thing we are we are doing within the county and and the same thing goes for the noxious weed plan um you know we talk to our neighbors uh Chris he'll he'll let us know if he has an issue for sure and then you know we try to be responsive and correct that issue as well as working with uh Cory Sweeney at um the weed superintendent for Moro County as well it's taking those lessons learned from our operating or further along in the permitting process projects and pulling that to these projects like all these documents are living documents and need to be updated as new information recommendation from County staff or you know subject matter experts uh comes up to date um and then just to I know there's a little bit of mystery of our um agricultural mitigation plan so I just kind of want to talk through how we got there and what what our thinking was right and so just to overview of the land we're using um predominantly not high value Farmland we're not using any irrigated land it's mostly dry land wheat and yeah we are expected to impact about um 3700 Acres of that land next slide please and so here here's kind of the reasons for a go three exception and just to be clear uh I think we fall under",

        "text": " while we're working to connect them to the services that we have shared today and then with that I will pass it over to my colleague to continue the presentation thank you Jess so my role for you here today is to talk you through the legal framework and the actual context or content of ordinance 896 which we are asking you to consider for adoption today so ordinance 896 arose in response in part to some decisions that came out of the U.S court of appeals for the ninth circuit and a house bill that was adopted by the Oregon legislature in 2021. so the First Federal Court case is a case well known to your board at this time at this point in this process but it's known as Martin V Boise and that is the case it stands for the proposition that the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the criminalization of the unavoidable context consequences of being unsheltered or homeless when the person doesn't have access to Alternative um the second that the second case out of the ninth circuit is a case called Johnson B Grant's Pass in that case did a number of things but for our context today I want to highlight two things the Johnson Court said the first was that they clarified that the sleeping in the context of Martin includes sleeping with rudimentary forms of protection against the elements and what that means is that a regulation that regulates camping on public property can't say that someone sleeping Outdoors can't have some forms of protections like sleeping bags or or blankets against the elements because they live outdoors the second thing the Johnson Court clarified was that the prohibition against the criminalization of homelessness applies to civil citations and penalties when those civil penalties are closely intertwined with criminal penalties or punishments finally in 2021 the Oregon legislature adopted House Bill 3115 which says that any city or county that regulates sitting lying sleeping living Outdoors must be objectively reasonable as to time place and manner with regard to the person experiencing homelessness so with that legal context in mind here's a quick snapshot of our um on this ordinance 896 we were first before the board in January 10th of this year to talk about best practices and ask your board for some feedback on broader policy questions we came back on April 4th in work session to walk you through the actual contents of a proposed ordinance after that presentation your board directed staff to begin Community feedback sessions which happened between May and June May 23rd and June 2nd of this year we were here just a few weeks ago for our first reading in this presentation and we are here today for the second reading and public hearing um so a quick snapshot of that Community engagement work we did to receive feedback from our community across the county and we specifically focused on reaching residents and unincorporated Washington County because that's where this ordinance will apply so we had four rather three in-person sessions and also a virtual session and during that period also had an online survey available to receive feedback from our community all right so um now to walk through the actual content of the ordinance before your board for consideration today so as as has been the case since April 4th when we first walked through the ordinance with you um the ordinance is structured to say that when um shelter or camping is prohibited on public property in unincorporated Washington County when shelter is available to the person in the camp or camping the ordinance then goes on to provide that wind shelter is not available to the person in the camper camping that activity would be regulated by reasonable time place and manner restrictions so first as to time when shelter is not available ordinance 896 will regulate camps and camping on public property in unincorporated Washington County to a five-day calendar period as your board is aware we arrived at this five-day period for a number of reasons the first being that in our experience over the last several years in managing encampments and and individuals who are camping on public property we've found that it takes three to five days to reach and connect these individuals with the Outreach workers and the services and programs that Jess spoke about at the beginning of the presentation uh notably and importantly the five-day period is also developed in Partnership and with full support of the Washington County Sheriff's Office as the proper balance of resources to enforce the time regulation and then finally we believe that the five-day period is reasonable we have to always remember that this work is going to be judged by its objectful reasonableness and there's already a basis in Oregon state law and in County adopted policy to give 72 hours or three days notice before removal of an established encampment so the five days is in line with that existing president next wind shelter is not available ordinance 896 will regulate the places where camping can or cannot occur so first I want to speak about the cannot occur places the ordinance does incorporate a number of places where camping would never be allowed even if there is no accessible shelter to the individual these places include tax foreclosure properties within 500 feet of designated shelters locations providing services to houseless individuals schools daycare facilities and family care providers and then also on any property designated or operated by Clean Water Services or any agency of the state of Oregon as a riparian corridor floodplain drainage area water quality sensitive area vegetative Corridor sensitive habitat or other significant natural resource area as we discussed with you when we were here in June we have also since um our uh in an indirect response to our community feedback sessions added another one additional no place and that is a regulation that would prohibit camps within 500 feet of any camp or encampment that had been regulated under this ordinance should it be adopted for reaching the five-day period or removed under the Washington County homeless recap removal policy or regulated under any other authority of Washington County so we heard from the community quite a bit questions about how far would a camp or camper have to move if it was regulated and we didn't have a clear answer for that so we added that expressly in the ordinance um so that would leave some permissive places where camping would be allowed subject to the time and manner regulations and those places would be the public right-of-way with some additional restrictions that I'll talk to you about in a minute and then other public property that's open to the public in an incorporated Washington County that doesn't otherwise fall in one of those no places before I move on to the Mana regulations I did want to take a moment to address some of the questions that we heard that were raised during our first presentation to you in June and specifically why the ordinance incorporates a 500 foot regulation instead of an a thousand foot or some uh foot regulation again as we approach this work we've had to balance trying to address or regulate encampments that may be near other properties that are designated for a specific use and addressing the health and safety concerns that may arise by those uses happening next to each other with the legal framework that says we can't eliminate all property and the regulation must be reasonable so as we started to look at what sort of regulations that might be we landed on 500 feet as something that created a consistent and significant amount of space without eliminating too much public property from where permissive campaign might occur if shelter isn't I also think it's notable that the cities of Beaverton Hillsboro Forest Grove and Tigard have all Incorporated 500 foot regulations so I think this creates some consistency and predictability and enforcement not only for our unhoused community but also our business and house community there was also some questions about whether the ordinance would prevent or impact the sighting of shelter or shelter Services nothing in the ordinance defines or impacts the sighting of those types of services should those Services be cited an encampment would becomes gets established or a camper comes near a shelter or or houseless service provider then the ordinance might apply if we're talking about unincorporated Washington County if we're in a jurisdiction an incorporated city with their own ordinance that that City's ordinance would apply and then finally we heard some questions about why we hadn't included senior care centers or assisted facilities in the ordinance each of the designated uses where we've added the 500 foot regulation are defined uses of property that exist in their Washington County Community Development code we do not have defined uses for assisted care facilities or Assisted Living living facilities so again in our efforts to make sure this ordinance is reasonable those that kind of use is not included for the proximity regulation and at this time the Ordnance wouldn't affect cabinet encampments occurring in those locations specifically finally our manner regulations when shelter is not available ordinance 896 will regulate how camping can occur in the permissive places for the allowing time period And in the allowed permissive places when shelter is not available again these are things that are very familiar to your board at this time they include things like allowing only Essentials for living Outdoors limiting the size of an individual camping area to nov larger than 144 square feet and prohibiting actions that may cause health or safety risks such as accumulation of waste non-cooking use of fire dumping of water that's used for cooking or bathing digging or trenching or any criminal activity are prohibited as I mentioned because the public right-of-way in unincorporated County Washington County does remain a possible permissive place we added additional manner regulations that would apply in addition to these things to the right-of-way these are things like no obstruction of of the travel way sidewalk bike path or bike lane no obstruction of access be it emergency non-emergency or Ada I'm not allowing encampments in areas where there's no curb or physical barrier between the camp materials and the area intended for traffic and then finally no allowing or camping under bridges in viaducts or in culverts to protect that public so again this brings us to the close of our presentation we are here asking you to consider enactment of the Ordnance Commissioners do you have any questions on the staff presentation before we move to a public hearing nope seeing none I'd like to open the public hearing and ask clerk Moss if we have anyone who wishes to testify on this matter thank you madam chair I did not see anyone sign up in the room but Madden please come forward well welcome you'll have two minutes to presents okay so you just give us your name speaking",

        "text": " soils um the applicant's assessment of potential potential impacts to soils and compliance with the soil protection standard are included in the application exhibit eye however the department also pulls and synthesizes and it's also just soils are discussed further um in the proposed order under other sections and in the application an exhibit g which has information on materials and k which has information about land use um the map here shows these soil map units within the site boundary and identifies the the soil types these soils identified within the site boundary uh which is important are designated as the highest ranking for susceptibility for wind erosion the department recommends soil conditions one and two be imposed to meet this standard so construction and operation activities that would impact soils um would be from grading that would happen for uh access roads and facility components such as the o m building substations uh the collector substations the step up substation battery storage and the inverter and transformer units associated with the solar modules other potential impacts include erosion from wind and water accidental chemical spills noxious weed infestation or revegetation failure mitigation and best management practices or bmps specific to soils include the applicant's pollutant discharge elimination system or nifty's 1200 seed permit application which includes the erosion and sediment control plan or escp um under recommended soil protection condition one this requires uh the results as i noted under the structural standard that the results of the site-specific geotechnical work um be included to update any of these mitigation measures to minimize impacts to soils additionally to minimize and control dust from wind erosion generating generated during construction the applicant proposes to implement a dust abatement and management plan which is recommended underneath the public services standard and this plan would require the implementation of stabilization measures dust control through daily continuous uh using water trucks and notification procedures for issues with dust and i do want to note here that um do i want to note this yes but this is also related um to one of the contested case issues that jessie's going to talk about later so a spill management plan is attached as uh to the proposed order as i to the spill management plan describes material handling and management procedures training requirements and and reporting recording reporting requirements for both uh construction and operation of the facility and it includes language to serve as the spill control and counter measure plan or spcc um under uh the soil protection condition too the department recommends that regardless of whether or not an spcc plan is federally required um that in order to implement the applicant's proposed spill management and hazardous substance program that that be included and provided as part of the and that is it for soil protection again jesse's going to be talking more about this um in his presentation thank you the land use standard requires that council find that a proposed facility complies with the statewide planning goals adopted by the land conservation and development commission or lcdc the council may find compliance with statewide planning goals if the council finds that a proposed facility complies with the applicable substantive criteria from the affected local government governments acknowledge comprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and in effect on the date the application is submitted in council's rules this date application is submitted it specifies that that is the date that the preliminary application is submitted or the pasc this is uh established as what we call the goal post for the land use criteria so the pasc was received in september of 2018 the governing body is lake county of of lake county as the lake county board of commissioners which council appointed as the special advisory group for this review under the land use standard the department recommends conditions one through seven to meet the standard so the proposed facility would be located on agricultural use a2 zone land in lake county under the lake county zoning ornament ordinance which is lczo which is kind of a tongue twister for me but that's okay uh section 3.01 the agricultural youth zone the purpose of the a2 zone is to grazing and other agricultural land the a2 zone is considered as a qualifying exclusive farm use efu is owned by lcdc therefore it's subject to the provisions of oer the oregon administrative rules chapter 660 division 33 which specifically apply to these efu zoned plans table 2 here that i have on my screen is the applicable substantive criteria identified by the applicant so i'm going to just note um a couple of items about um lczo section 2419 this is also related to contested case issue 2 which jesse will expand on in his uh the proposed order evaluates the lczo section 2419b which requires that within an a2 or a1 or a2 zone uh non-firm uses would not demonstrate a serious interference with or significant increase in the cost of accepting accepted farming practices as defined in ors 215 203 sub 2 sub c on adjacent lands devoted to farm use the underlying landowner of over 2 700 acres of the facility site commented on the record of the dpo that the lands are not feasible for establishing commercial a commercial agricultural operation because of the poor soil quality and inability to get a water right he also explained uh that he had attempted to use the land for grazing but that was not a viable use for the so we had mentioned soils previously soils within the site boundary are classified by the natural resource conservation services or nrcs as classification 6 which fall into the definition of non-arable soils or land which is considered by lc dc definitions to be not suitable not suitable for cultivation oar66033 130 sub 38j this restricts a solar pv uh generating facility for using occupying covering more than 320 acres of non-arable land this facility as we are aware uh would cover would occupy or cover um over 3 900 acres of non-arable land and therefore would not comply with this acreage threshold oar 660 33 130 38 sub k outlines that an exception of the acreage threshold may be taken under uh rs 197 732 and chapter 660 of division iv as evaluated in the proposed order the applicant requests that council take an exception to the acreage threshold based on a reasons exception um which council is familiar uh hearing about and discussing the state policy embodied in gold for goal 3 is the preservation and maintenance of agricultural land for farm use so in order for the council to turn to determine whether to grant an exception to a statewide planning goal the council must the applicant must provide reasons justifying why the state policy embodied in the goal three should not apply and then there's also other criteria that is evaluated and looked at by council as well the applicant identifies that accepted farming practices on surrounding lands include irrigated agriculture and grazing and ranching activities this is uh also related to contested case issue four so jesse will get into this in more detail i just wanted to note that in the proposed order the um reasons that are evaluated are the minimal impacts to agriculture and the local economic benefits reason under the local economic benefits reason the proposed order explains that as identified by the applicant local economic benefits would be by the underlying lease payments to landowners the creation of the construction jobs community service fees paid to lake county through a strategic investment program or sip and uh under this sip agreement the applicant maintains that they would pay two thousand dollars per megawatt annually for 15 years additionally the applicant also commits to remitting payment of ten thousand dollars per megawatt to the north county or north lake county school district foundation um totaling up to four million dollars and these are um recommended under land use condition as noted uh there are other criteria that are evaluated for the goal exception that jesse will touch on later council if council has questions or one that's kind of that's a lot that actually is my conclusion for land use um which there's a lot in there but a lot will be uh discussed later but does council have any questions any questions for kellen chair girl this is can't i don't have a question but i have a kind of a little statement here i think i'd like to make i think it's an appropriate time especially after just the discussion on under landis i had a long career in land use and um what i saw over time was how more litigious things got and so i think it's appropriate to make this comment that is as litigious as these citing applications are becoming as comprehensive and complex as the requirements are it's incumbent upon the applicants to provide complete thorough and detailed information and reasoning so that we can make robust findings of fact and conclusions of law that will withstand challenges the burden of proofs on the applicant this is a plea do your homework many of the land use standards are not clear and objective uh they're quant they're not quantitative but they're qualitative um and so don't provide conclusory arguments but give us the detailed facts and reasoning on how the applicable standards are met so just a heads up to future applicants up your game thank you ken good feedback thank you uh council member howe marcy this is yes haley and i and i'll follow kent's comment um but i'll do it uh when we talk about the contested case i have similar comments as kent's maybe a little bit more uh thank you thank you thank you councilman remember jenkins other comments on land use okay moving forward uh the council's protected area standard protected areas uh in um under council standard is they're kind of designated or listed as certain types of areas that are considered protected areas i have a map here on the screen that shows the identified protected areas within the analysis area which is 20 miles in this kind of tan color um proposed facility is kind of right here located in the center table three over here is pulled from the proposed order and identifies the protected area and the distance from the site boundary so um the two um closest protected areas are this devil devil's garden lava bed which includes derrick's cave um and conley hills c rna and a c e c is an area of critical environmental concern and an rna is a research natural area so that's what those abbreviations mean based on the review of the applicant's view shed analysis and the assessment presented in the proposed order the department recommends that council find the proposed facility would not cause significant adverse and adverse visual impact to any of the protected areas in the analysis area further underneath the",

I even went back and was looking at one of my letters to the Planning Commission and uh Gene you were there at the time yourself and anyway thanks very much for the great work I've represented a lot of cities in my lifetime six or seven or eight of them and have been before hundreds of Planning Commission meetings and you folks have done a stellar job in my humble opinions the one thing I want to make sure is clear I do have uh one of my clients in the North Area who has received interest from two national developers already and we have received actually received a signed offer from one of them we have not responded uh completing me to that yet but that's the kind of interest that has been generated which simply you going back to kind of square one after I hit number two and to get a division pulled together the economic development analysis etc etc putting all the pieces together and going forward I'd like to encourage you to include in your recommendation of approval I assume that's what it will be please but including your recommendation of approval to the city council we recommend that they bring the entire 1293 Acres of Sherwood West into the boundary and the main reason there's a number of reasons are 10 or take a short period of time but uh the main one is that it will give you the ability to walk in place the the plan itself you've spent all this time I hate to see what happened in tiger with uh River Terrace 2 and River Terrace One River Terrace two was done completely we they didn't bring in River Terrace two the strip where the infrastructure had to go across and finally they've done that just recently and it was very frustrating so I encourage you to bring it all in at once it makes planning complete it if phasing comes out of the infrastructure uh process which you will now engage in uh in Mass and uh and the Metro Council I understand has been fully apprised of what you've been doing so I get it locked in so that you can control what happens thank you very much for time and attention and the ability to speak with thanks John we got all that thank you um anybody else yeah that was all the people that signed up to tell the people that we had signed up did we miss anyone on there looks like we did not all right thank you very much and thank you for your creativeness that Save the Day all right so I have three proponents and one opponent the first proponent is Peter Foster chair mission thank you for your time today my name is Peter Foster I am at 19 800. Southwest Kruger Road thank you yeah thank you I'm a chef entrepreneur landowner out on the west portion of the expansion plan and my family team and I are excited to show our support for this West expansion when you see the hospitality Zone on that upper left piece the goal and the vision is a single Farm Restaurant that could be a destination point and definitely a community anchor if done correctly uh so I'm a chef by trade and I don't know much about the the rest of what we're talking about here today and I've submitted my testimony in writing so you can see how I really feel about this and how passionate we are about this project but what I can say is that we need the whole piece to be brought in at once and I hope that is the recommendation because sewer and water is going to be a big part of this and I'm a landowner who's willing to work with the city and the community simultaneously to make sure that what we're doing has the full bless of everybody right so we're really open to saying hey if we're going to do a two-acre Farm let's make it a Farm Park let's bring people in and families that can come in and check it out let's connect back to our food sources and where that all comes from because Sherwood's known for a lot of great things but it's not for Destination restaurants and my plan is to to work as hard as I can with you folks and in the community and everyone else here to make that happen and I've I've lived in enough places it seems like towns that react to growth versus plan for growth tend to kind of get absorbed or disenfranchised and we're surrounded by towns like that and so I commend the work of of Erica and the CAC and you guys to know that growth is inevitable Oregon almost mandates it if if you know I understand that correctly and I've I've educated myself and my partners on on what all that means so to plan in the right way and all of what we just saw up there I know is just a concept but it's really well looked at and it's really thoughtfully done and I think it does preserve what Sherwood stands for and that's why we support it um you know we're not proponents of turning Wildland into identical developments again I'm a chef I'm not a developer I don't know the first thing about developments but we are proponents of keeping Sherwood in front of loss of identity and potential future abandonment because if a town doesn't grow it dies and when the next Generations and new ideas live somewhere else there's nothing anchoring the kids at the high school to even stick around and that's another cool piece of our project is that I've already talked to the uh a lot of the staff at Sherwood High School and folks on the school board and we've already got plans to you know bring the kids up and the AG program is one of the better ones and the culinary program is probably the I've ever seen I'm a graduate of The Culinary Institute of America New York and that kitchen is solid these kids need somewhere to sort of integrate what they've learned into real life and I don't want to take up too much time but I hope you do recommend this plan",

some questions about the way that this was being implemented I'm sorry forgive me for the short notice link all of my notes um I guess I'm ready to start whenever the timer is yeah it started about 25 seconds ago what would policy design analysis and implementation for three state level government agencies including five years of council Administration and Oregon administrative rule writing and implementation I'm a public policy expert in my career when I wrote my MPA thesis on a meeting budget shortfalls and City governments I wanted to come to this meeting to provide you um my uh analysis on this um ordinance Bill 1223 creates a Statewide tax on Oregon's net oregonians net income no matter they live in or work in Salem this bill explicitly taxes the net income of oregonians as well as the employees of the state of Oregon uh from the Safe Salem website this includes those are who are self-employed as well as remote workers and 70 000 commuters to Salem I currently live in Portland my office is in downtown Portland yet I will be taxed almost 800 a year towards the city I have known community in because I'm paid by a building in Salem I do not appreciate the hand wave of it's too complicated to explain to my fellow state employees when your policy is written specifically to affect us many of my colleagues fall into this bucket and there are thousands of state employees in rural areas who also face this tax I wanted to break down some numbers um so the bill explicitly does not tax anyone earning minimum eight wage but what about I don't know five cents 10 10 cents above minimum wage our restaurant colleagues the urban minimum wage is 14 and now or fourteen dollars and twenty cents an hour um which would equivocate a 240 tax annually of course that's not going to be taxed because of the state minimum um but if we go up to 15 an hour that's a thirty one thousand dollar 200 salary with a 254 dollar tax annually which brings it to the equivalent of 14.87 an hour so you're knocking off 13 cents an hour from the 15 hour dollar or 15 an hour wage in Salem effectively causing uh like a deflation of the salem-based um I find the equity analysis of this bill laughable this will disproportionately impact lower income rural oregonians who have no say in the um looking at who has in had input into the design I'm not surprised the normative goal of this tax is to address Budget shortfalls in community safe safety in Salem Salem not Marion County not Independence not Silverton not Multnomah County not Medford I'm sorry your time has expired thank you thank you that concludes uh the list of folks who have signed up is there anybody else here who had intended to speak who did not sign up yes I wanted to sign up get yourself up there to the microphone and we'll get you it gets going here be sure and introduce yourself and uh your ward or your address please hit that green there you go so my name is Alan Rasmussen I serve as the president of the Salem chamber uh Salem area Chamber of Commerce also 41.95 Aumsville highway I had the pleasure a month or so ago to work with Josh and his team Dr Brown Paul and it was great to kind of dive into this and there are some structural issues I I agree with Paul and some of that um but when I I came out of that meeting and I really appreciate the city for the Outreach they did in that but when I came out there I came out with a metaphor that came to my my mind that this ordinance is almost like a blank contract where the citizens are going to sign on the bottom you guys will fill in the terms and we have no say The rulemaking Happening after the fact is and I'm not sure that all options have been explored the state of Oregon is not supporting this city where have you guys been to reach out to them and demand a payment in lieu of property taxes you had a fellow counselor just recently who is now a state legislature I don't know that that option has been addressed that alone uh per the city's consultant would meet a third of a little more than a third of the deficit that you guys are trying to to close um you know some of my other comments or thoughts from that meeting was that police and fires should be and and houseless services should be number one they should have their own dedicated fund they should not be general fund we went down all these funds and I'm like this one that one and police and fire house was just thrown in general fund it should be prioritized and while I applaud the effort and hard work of DJ and what the church in the park does um you know the few dollars we're throwing at this is truly trying to put a Band-Aid on a gushing wound we need to be demanding the state and the FEDS to address this issue they need to step up and serve their communities and so even in my in other ideas in my in my my company my industry we build modular buildings and all the other states that we deal with including Washington just recently past third party rules they do plan review they do inspections third party and still maintain their fees for Revenue you know I think the Builders of this community would tell you they would gladly uh welcome that so you know last we talked it's been talked about tonight to have hard choices and I disagree frankly it's an easy decision uh tonight let the voters decide uh this issue for their Community thank you thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who had intended sure step on up sir please introduce yourself and your address or your word hit that green button before you start there you go okay there you go good now you're good okay mayor Hawaii city council thank you for taking my late testimony um for the record my name is Andrew sagart I live on State Street about five minutes east of Cordon Road just out of the city limits while I'm not a resident of Salem I work at the state capitol as a state employee as a legislative director for state representative so even though I'm not a resident I'll have to pay this tax even though I don't receive the same Services as the residents of Salem someone to find that as inequity as a part of my job I analyze the various different agency and general fund budgets and help my boss decide whether those particular budgets are worthy of his yes vote based on how well an agency is effective at using precious tax payer dollars I can't tell you how many how much waste I've seen in those budgets during my short time I've worked at the state an example that comes to mind is last biennium during the covid pandemic there was a line item for over one million dollars to build a gazebo for the Portland Art Museum s like a waste of money especially since the Oregon State Police has been underfunded for decades well I haven't dived deep in the Salem City budget I'm confident that there are similar non-essential programs in it that could be cut instead of passing this regressive and inequitable tax I ask you to please roll up your sleeves prior reject this inequitable regressive tax prioritize essential services like public or police fire and basic infrastructure progress projects and then or um find savings elsewhere thank you for your time thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who wanted to my name is Aaron Criswell I'm in Ward one I'm a neighbor of Pam and I work for Rich Duncan listening all the testimony given tonight it makes me proud to be that everybody's come forward but I you know and looking at this I've I've served the military and and I think the Democratic process is an amazing thing but I think that this needs to go before the people I think you all have a responsibility for the people we voted you had placed you're here and the steps that we need to do to to take to make these choices and decisions need to be before the people and I think by doing that that is the Democratic process that's what we need to do and that's the direction this needs to go families are hurting there is the homeless population they're hurting I deal with Public Safety on another job and we deal with the homeless all the and it's sad the situations that they're in but these are the votes that need to be put before the people thank you thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who wanted to I'm not seeing anyone's oh just came out from behind the pillar just in the nick of time you can go right there hit that button for me state your name hi my name is Tanner Elliott I live on 585 Winter Street Northeast I just moved here um in January to take a job at the state capitals the chief of staff for state representative and you know honestly this feels like a slap in the face um we look at this city we have tons of money that goes to the homeless population and the problem just continues to get worse and you say we need the money for fire and police and I respect our law enforcement I respect their fire and I think those services are important but I feel like there's other ways to go about this instead of attacks um I'm only 23. I want to have a family I want to buy a house this is on do you think I want to continue to stay in the state of Oregon and live in Salem so I encourage you all to vote no um it's a tough decision ahead of you but please there's other ways just like uh my friend Andrew mentioned earlier Portland spent a million dollars in a gazebo for the Portland Zoo I know we're not but we're starting to become Portland you look at the problems um so I encourage you to vote no and be much appreciated thank you thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who wanted to testify all right let's take a five minute break CC media thank you everybody we are back in session and I am going to initially just close the public hearing we extend the meeting to 11. you can add that we moved by Stapleton seconded by Phillips it would extend to 11. we have a rule that says we have to end meetings by 10 pm so in order to",

        "text": " are looking at it as a daytime use only in relation to you for that field effect as well. This is a cross section which follows this purple just to kind of give you a perspective of how they're looking at it is this would be the DRA type space and then the play field sits slightly higher and then it also then elevates up to where the residences are. Questions from staff is that if this location is acceptable, then some options might be providing for vegetation or fencing along the field and formally prohibiting lighting for that field. The applicant has noted, for instance, a viburnum hedge could be added into the type a buffer because ordinally a type a buffer does not require a full complete hedgerow. And then additionally, in terms of the southeastern cul de sac, the original arrangement was anticipated to have lots that would have homes backing up to a neighboring house that was then about to be under construction. That house has since been completed and it sits roughly in line with the cul de sac here, which they've now brought down forward. They are providing for their buffer. The edge of the cul de sac is about 54ft. And so staff does have some concern about, for instance, cars coming down. They would be facing that home. A discussion with the applicant points out that they could potentially then provide for a hedgerow within that buffer there, or provide for some fencing as an alternative. And staff would note that that should at least be at the width of that cul de sac space there. If that's ultimately an adjustment, that's acceptable to the board and at that point in time, I'll defer for questions for the board in the public comment. And the applicant is due to be here. Commissioner Bryant. Okay, so I'm probably going to have a problem with moving that. That playfield to be backing up next to those homes that are along there. And then number two, another thing that we're going to have to address, because we just went through this with another infill project out in that area, is when they. When it comes time for them to clear that land for development. No burning on that site. So I don't know how we take care of that. It's not what. Commissioner, we can. We can follow up. Commissioner Tracy Straub, assistant county administrator. We can. We can make that comment to our contractor and tell them no more burning. But they. That should. All that site should have already been completed. Okay. Am I in a different location? Yeah, you might be on the eastern rather than new development. Tracy, Master plan. I will follow up. We can hold Mister Radcliffe here, we can hold the contractor accountable. But that area at 100th street. We're on 100th street. Yes. The contractor has been active out there. Okay. Not the street itself, but the subdivision itself. But we can follow up with the contractor and ensure that there was no burning on site. Anything else before I invite the applicant up? Okay, Mister Radcliffe. Good afternoon. Mike Radcliffe, 20 611 Southeast Lake. Where Avenue Ocala. I agree with Chris's report and their recommendation for approval. I'm not aware of the burning situation. If you can't. If that's a special condition that you apply, we would certainly comply with it. It just hasn't come up to my knowledge before now. Right. Because we haven't. Recent. Recent infill activity or infill activity has really ramped up lately in clearing of the lands. And we just had an fill project going on a few months ago, and the burning that was going on on site became a major problem. And so, actually, tracy and I have talked about possibly bringing back to the board some revisions in the land development code pertaining to this, with more and more of these infill projects coming online. So that was my question. It was a big problem. Right. Mister Radcliffe, I think you also heard that Commissioner Bryant has an issue with moving that field. Can you. I would like to address that. The reason that we shifted it. I don't know if you can pull up the aerial, Chris, or not, but we tried to accomplish several things, one of which could be indirectly related to the burning issue. We tried to shift the field around where I. We could save some of the larger oak trees and still provide adequate screening for the adjacent properties. We felt it was a good fit. We also were able to use, by berming the DRA drainage retention area along the westerly side. We would be constructing our vegetation higher than the houses to the west, again providing some additional screening. And the berm would actually. Instead of digging a deep water retention area that has completely flat bottom, we're trying to save some of the trees. So the berm would basically let the drainage retention area perform more like a triangle, fills up a little deeper on the one end and spreads out as necessary to hold the water and meet the hundred year drainage requirements. So the positioning preserves the most live oak trees, which are a little bit further to the north. You can see the vegetation change about midway down those get into some more planted pines. That's the reason we did that. We didn't design it in a vacuum. We tried to take into consideration those other factors. So the bermin will be alongside that westerly border there, where you're planning on putting the field. There'll be a 30 foot buffer, and then the berm will begin. And you're trying to make it as no touch as possible, is that what I'm hearing? As what is possible? No touch. The buffer? Yes. Okay, we'll add that. We'll add vegetation to the buffer. The intent is to not take any vegetation out of the buffer, which includes live oak trees. There are some in it. Yes, ma'am. And what about. And Chris? Can you also point out where the cul de sac area is as well? Okay. Can you speak to that as well? Yes. On that area, we went through several iterations and revisions with the staff. We had proposed a 30 foot buffer. There had one iteration where cul de sac was up against the buffer. We moved that back an additional 25ft, and we had proposed the planning. I had intended to plant the viburnum hedge along there because I know that makes a good screen. Chris pointed out to me that just our detail doesn't specifically show that. So we could certainly add that the plantings were going to be there. We just weren't specific about that 90 to 100 foot area where there might be a headlight encroachment. Anything else? We think it will be addressed sufficiently. Anything else from the board at the moment for the applicant? If not, I'll call for public comment. Yes. I wanted to follow up on what Commissioner Bryant said. I believe we do not have a condition in the bud not to burn on site, but I believe the board can impose that condition with the master plan so staff can carry it out. Oh, good. Yes. Commissioner, can you just, can you reference to me what the issue that you had is? Because, you know, I fully have operated and been a part of, you know, whether you're open burning or using some type of air curtain. And so I don't have a problem with making the regulation. But. But in some cases, it's better to burn on site doing it well than it is to truck hundreds of loads of big trucks on the road. So, I mean, you know, you are always, there's always a counter to that, that problem. So if they do it in the middle of this property and they do it with an air curtain and a high incineration rate, it could be excavated in pits and use air curtains. Tracy, that we just had an issue with open k and commissioners. It was Tracy Straub, assistant county administrator. It was adjacent to Palm K, and then also copper leaf was the one that I had in my mind, that is just west of here. And so they were doing some open burns and then they went into some pits and we were having some continuous issues. Ash smoke constantly. For the residents that live adjacent to that property. How close was it to the property? I don't have. They had not backed up against the property line. They were in the middle, and they had also moved themselves where there was less development. But we were getting continuous complaints. And I'll make sure you each get the pictures that I got at 10:00 at night. One night of the huge fire that was going on. That's probably open burn then that one wasn't open. That was one. But multiple complaints coming in. Forestry division of Forestry is supposed to regulate that. And we had multiple complaints coming into our office. I got most of those complaints because I did this. Yeah, that's my district. And when we would forward those to division of forestry, nothing was being, nothing was being done until. Until there was a major fire at about 1011 o'clock at night on either, what was it, a Friday or Saturday night? It was also in the summer and the heat was really oppressive and. Yeah, but you had. I just didn't want to unilaterally, you know, because not all contractors are the same. None of them. So if we have a complaint, I think we should be able to resolve it. If we can't resolve it, then we should shut them down. But I just don't think you should unilaterally get rid of all burning, because it does have some advantages. We're talking about projects like this that are infill where you have that everything is developed around it. You are not going to get",

        "text": " are becoming scarce which so pushes out those toss up um and then it then also for those that are aging they're trying to wait until EV trucks are more available the cost of Maintenance and all that is increasing so there's number of of aspects that could be um pushing cost of the equipment to support the system upward so those are some of the the risks that we're identifying at this point so you us yes I don't want it to be a surprise uh anyone from a murf have any questions or anything that you'd like to add uh I would just clarify a little a little bit the U on the trucks I know Ryan said they're getting scarce they're putting allocations on those so they have to sell certain number of electric vehicles to release allocations for diesels that got pushed out another year but that is going to be in place next year so that is kind of the pause on what we're doing with equipment um just a little more context than electric vehicle is about twice what the uh current diesel vehicles we're using are um and and we still don't have fueling stations for those and so that's a that's a huge cost as well infrastructure wise what are the actual cost of a of a diesel U truck versus a electric truck yeah I haven't bought any this year I'm in that holding Zone the last I've I've heard truck getting close to 400 so 400,000 so the electric vehicle um which doesn't do what the diesel truck does today it's about a I would say 60 to 70% uh of that job uh it costs 800,000 and that but you have to still get the infrastructure for the fueling on the charging station Plus getting the uh high voltage into your facility which is uh a significant Endeavor if you could imagine climate action is not cheap no and there there are approximately I don't know the exact number but there's somewhere around a 100 um collection vehicles that operate uh within Maran County that would be incorporated and unincorporated thank you yeah any questions thank you ran go to the next one uh Sol policy discussion so want to L tag on to the discussion of kosa and that um one of the last as ects that we wanted to kind of discuss that's in our policy considerations is CPI inflation factor which kind of that R review so I I wanted to just point out unless I moved waste reduction statements and zero waste over into the policy considerations uh column as requested from last month um but today wanted to talk about kind of the CPI and I thought that would be just it would fit well with the rest of the conversation we've had today great thank you so this is just goes in this is going to take a I'm try not to go too deep of a DI but a little bit of kind of we talk about all right what the fuel forecast looks like or what CPI so this is just a little bit of U part of the U discussion could be do we want to and I think there's some value in formula izing where we get the information to inform U what how we forecast costs so we don't have to say well I think we had to do it this way or maybe we should do this way we we defined that this is a source of information and then we can um talk about how we're going to use that Source or uh interpret that or use that for forecasting but maybe formalizing uh the source of some these these these information so for instance a diesel fuel uh historically we've used uh so US Energy Information Administration as What's called the West Coast number two be ultral sulur whether there's a very specific and in price price uh retail price per gallons um what you see in the uh table Below in the gray shaded area are the actual uh price per gallon for uh this um uh I going to say CPI but any for for this index the how we then take that information and try to extrapolate into the future what that might look like um is again not having a cryst ball not knowing what the future holds you see the last one there 2024 of April was $4 $4.72 per gallon uh the Assumption that's being made with how we've been forecasting is that that whatever that latest month price is what's going to be holding uh indefinitely okay so we then take if you look over in the right hand column the annual average we're taking the average of that full year so in 2024 we have the four months of actuals plus that 6 point or 4.67 to for the rest of the months averaging that then comparing that annual average to the prior year annual average coming up with a year-over-year percentage change so we see on the year-over-year percentage change for 2024 it decreased 5.7% so that's kind of the some of the mechanics yeah if you will of how we're how we're calculating that so that's uh right so if you look back on fuel it was a 5.7% you uh the next one uh labor and medical insurance so uh this as a reminder I think I may have mentioned this before uh one of our haulers Republic Services um uh has a collective bargaining unit for their drivers and for the majority of their employees our other um local uh privately owned familyowned businesses do not operate under that collective bargaining but we use that Collective bargain targeting as the basis for what we anticipate the the uh escalation or labor rates would increase for the for the full system if that makes sense so for labor rates but does when you say labor rates does that include medical insurance uh no Med so medical insurance um so Aura which is the Oregon rep use and recycling Association it's a uh industry Association here in Oregon that all of the hallers and Industry members uh have so they have a group plan insance all right so it's not like some of the smaller ones don't have well absolutely they definitely have access to that and they're all part of that uh that group plan if they're a member or which is why it's separate from labor it's a really a different yeah thank you yep thank you so those are I think that kind of covers those to um the next uh disposal we've talked a lot about disposal but I want to just go into that just a little maybe with a little bit more granularity um Municipal Solid Waste generally Salem Maran side um so we talked about that rate is approved by the Maring County Board of Commissioners there's a combination of things that go into that one is how much is the actual cost of disposal which is what we're talking about with reworld and their contract with re world and how much Maran County pays them per ton the difference in that pays for uh Maran County's solid waste their U Environmental Services uh um waste education and Outreach um the uh Earthwise program and you know all the work that they do to support that and so there's a there's a margin in there there's more than that there's um so they uh Maring County uh owns and so there's Browns Island out by meau there's the north Maran transfer station there skirts so they own a lot of these other properties as well and there's some uh long-term reserves and some liability and costs that come with those as well uh it also pays for battery recycling the paint program you know a number of other types of things that we um we don't normally think of but are are paid for by that by that margin so that's where is that margin you know there's a $20 difference or reduction in that margin Maran county is going to have to be asking those hard questions of what do they pay for versus maybe that costus maybe they as an example they decide hey we can't pay for the battery program directly ourselves we're going to let the cities take care of that or or something you know they may have to make some of those tough decisions uh the P County side again we talked about that is set by cofin be landfill which is all operated by the services the mixed organic side that rate is set by Maring resource recovery facility uh two main factors on that are the cost to reload and transport that to the Pacific Regional compost which is one of the two facilities will be ter room tomorrow and then of course the cost of actual disposal at at the PRC at facility uh and finally Co mled recycling um again we talked briefly about that earlier that's the average actual year-to dat um uh year-to dat actual average of the market rate paid by the holler so at that point in time you know when we were looking at rates uh was it last August we were trying you know in May it was one number in July was another because we had more information we had um more actuals that we were able to factor into that average and so we're always trying to refine um as close as possible to the time we're adopting rights to have the most any questions on the last one is just general inflation this is pretty much everything else uh that wasn't covered by something else this that's applied to all the other costs uh in general so the base um uh talk about this but the base that we use for all these is the previous complet fully completed year so we take what 2023 was and we take whatever that inflation factor is and that's how we come up with the fact the expense forecaster expense for the current year the escalation Source on this is Compu consumer index uh all Urban consumers so it's a CPI more specifically it's all items in West uh size class BC all Urban consumers not seasonally adjusted the kind of the the the process of the uh mechanics of it again similar table to what we had before the dark or the gray area are the actual CPI uh what you have down below is the uh change in percentage from the previous year uh for that month to the current year for that month fact what we're doing though is we're taking that uh annual average of the CPI and coming up with the difference now with fuel if you remember we took whatever the most recent month was and we just extend that out yeah right a little different methodology here the longterm CPI average is 2 and a half% so goes up and down all the time but the average long term is around 2 and a half% so what we're doing is right the last one was a 3.7% in April 2024 which",

        "text": "ball seasons, we don't get those calls from the private sector, rent them. In this mass, we've got the one or two travel ball teams. I've seen this facility get built because I am active with baseball and I do see we travel up and down 326 a lot when we travel. So I've seen it mature and seeing it grow from the Ocala tribe with the barn to what it is now. As far as the 10:00 p.m. turn off, that's a condition that I think the applicant was looking at APM. And I think that's solid. I know even at our parks we struggle with 08:00 p.m. sometimes specifically with active sports. So the games do go longer sometimes. And I don't think we want to shut off lights in the middle of the game just because the clock hits nine or eight, whichever. So this is not supposed to be games played, though. This is supposed to be a scrimmage on and off in a training facility. Yeah. They should be able to hand at 08:00 pretty on the dot. Sounds good. Sure, Brian. Well, so you talked about, about the buffering. What would you recommend? Because I know that you are an arborist as well. No, I'm not an arbot. I'm one step above that. I'm a landscape architect. Sorry. I've got a degree and a license, not just a certification. So here we go. Because. Humbleness coming. No. There you go. Know, you know, I'm going toa wait for my time setting up with all these engineers. So here I am. Well, and I ask you that because. I'm sorry, I knew that you were la architect. I said the wrong thing. I asked you that because you are. You do have that knowledge. And because of what we're looking at with those stadium lights. We know they're going to shine, but we also know that it takes time. It does. For things to grow. So what are our recommended plan? I would use a mixed canopy of different varieties of oaks. You could. I mean, people hate Larel oaks, but they do grow fast. As long as you're using some intermittently, you can get some good mixed apple shade over a longer period of time. So this idea of spacing trees at a certain distance, I believe that's a firm code issue across this country. It's not nearily a formal dictation or edict on how trees should be planted closely because they're not planted that closely in the forest. They're actually jammed in there. And that's what makes a good tree canopy. So looking at variety of trees would be good. Fast growing, slow growing native trees are going to be fine there. And I think that description that I gave you right there is enough for a qualified designer to give a wholesome plan too. Okay, so Mister Coulyard, the exterior lighting, the section 6.19 of our Marion county land development code, does it address what you shared with us of the luminum? It's almost like we need an as built of that. But that's a bit of a requirement to put on the applicant right now. But as the plans come in, if they don't change the lights from where, where they are now to where the plans are submitted, we'll see an accurate reading of how bright those lights are. Because that grid is usually on a five to ten foot grid on a plan that'show you where the lumens fall away the further you move away from the light fixture. So the condition states exterior lighting shall adher to section 6.19 of the Marion county land development Code. Yes ma'am. So I'm going to ask again what you described with the photometrics. And that's in there? Yes. Okay's thee to confirm that it was covered here. You're fine under that. Reg chaires under that plan. Is it correct to say that they have to keep that light on their property and or shade it or whatever they need to do to keep that light from going off their property? Yes sir. See, you'll see light pollution, light glare you'll see all those terms. You'll see the words hooding baffling everything that you can use for physical structures to help prevent that. I don't know if you go up and down Fort King at night, but you can see the tennis center. It's been years since they've added the hoods to those lights. And before they added the hoods to those lights, the Yances s front yard in their house is completely well lit at 10:00 at night. So thankfully those do work. Those hoods do work. We use them extensively in all of our new sports field lighting. Mister Mintor, does Commissioner Gold have anything? I have not received any new questions or emails from Commissioner Gold, so I don't assume he's still listening in. Okay, very good, Ma. Vice chairman, you're done. Can we also ask our code enforcement? I got some questions. I want to understand how this works. Thank you, Mister Coolrard. If we could have code enforcement come forward. Forward. Mister Gold just said 09:00 p.m. shutdown is good. I'm in favor with the conditions except change in time to 09:00 p.m. i also have no problem with a five year expiration of May 16, 2028. Very good. Thank you. And thank you, commissioner Gold. Good afternoon. I'm me, leter Holley, code enforcement officer of Mary county. Hello, Mister Holly, can you just go through the process of when the code enforcement issue started, what the response was, and did you talk to the owners themselves originally? No, I did not talk to the owners. After the last PNZ meeting I was able to speak with her directly, but it started. We got a call from parks and rec about them removing trees without a permit before anything was built. Before anything was built? Yes. On a one property in Marion county. I'm not sure if you're aware, but a one property, you're not allowed to remove trees without a permit unless it's for pastures, building a house, stuff like that. Miss Kelly did tell me that they didn't remove any trees, but I've looked at the previous photos to now and there's been a lot of trees removed from that property. You can go to 20 nineteen's aerial photos on the GIS map and see many of trees have been removed from what I was told she was working. They were working with Susan Hayen, who is in Parks and Rec. She is the tree mitigation specialist over there. So I've kind of left that off to the side and lets you and take care of that because that's her specialty. But we do have notices, a violation sent to them for the zoning obviously not permitted uses. And the biggest one is the setback of the barn that is there. And you can see this is the previous picture. If you look down in the southeast corner and on the east side, if you look to the pictures that are today, you can see all those trees are gone. But where they built the batting cages, they said they just converted a pole barn. But they added to the pole barn which encroached into the setback. And agriculture, you got to be a 25 foot setback. I believe they're at 18ft, so they do not meet setbacks. They have not applied for a variance to cover that setback. What about the fields and the building permits? You're not taking care of that part, are you? I'm not, no. Building department has their own officers that take care of that. What did they tell you about the setbacks for their'letters? They're still working on what to do. I told them they either need to redo the building or apply for a variance. I've put everything on hold since they've applied for the special use permit. The original person that worked with them at Tillman and Associates called me. I don't know if you remember Mister John Harvey. He called me and I spoke with him and I told him about the variance that was needed. And they, you know, I thought they would include the variants in the special use permit, but they didn't. So. So now we're still waiting to see what they're going to do about the setback violation. Okay. And do we know where Susan is at on the tree mitigation? I have not spoken with her. Do you know? All right, madam, if vice chair, is it ok if I misterute. ##e Mister Coyaard, if you'll please come back to the podium. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. We appreciate your time. So I believe we're just waiting for the final of the tree plans to be submitted so we can see what their proposed plans are. So we do have an idea of the acreage or the inches being removed. But as far as what that actually goes, we don't have a site plan to base that off of. Currently we only have the two parcels and we can calculate the acreage times would have been under the tree preservation standards of 100 inches per acre. But I don't think they were quite at that. So it's just a matter of taking a look at some of these old photographs and taking a look at street views of bigger trees. That were removed, those are the ones we're mainly concerned about. Is there a timeline as to when that is expected? No, I don't. I think that might be something Mister Tilly can speak to, I believe. I didn't know if it had been provided to. No, not that I'm aware of. Okay. Thank you. Yes, sir. Yes sir. Mister attornney, just a couple of comments. One, Mike Savage apparently is listening in. He's texted that they are",

        "text": " 530 000 customers and their their power system includes over 4 000 miles of transmission line including um under 700 miles in oregon um they also operate um some stations and distribution lines um uh several of which are in oregon as well this table here oe1 is from proposed order 62 and this lists uh 230 kb transmission line projects that the applicant has constructed they also describe the department summarizes uh they provide in the asc application and the department summarizes in the proposed that the applicant has um has constructed from 1981 a uh 345 to 500 kv transmission line that's about 84 miles in length um and then that line was constructed to 500 kv standards but it actually is energized and operates out at 345. um however it has the capacity and safety standards to operate at a 500 kb um and then we talked about in the proposed order that since 2009 the applicants built about 27 miles of 69 kilovolt transmission lines in oregon and a 16 mile 138 kilovolt transmission transmission line in oregon um and the applicant describes in the afc an asus application for site certificate for application new users really constructing and operating because at this table here you're like well it's kv they don't it's not 500 kv and this is mostly a 500 kv transmission line um which we do give examples of uh a transmission line that was operators just not operating at a 500 kv but they the applicant talks about how it's largely the same it's very um to construct and operate a 500 kv transmission line to a 230 kb transmission liner in between um the difference and a lot of that of why it's similar is because it's not actually up to the applicant and i'm going to touch on this on my next slides it's really that the the design standards for this are are one regulated by state and federal federal agencies but also by the nes seat so there's certain design codes that that dictate um the uh the spanning distances based on tower types um your type of cabling um the the configuration your right-of-way clearances um so uh and that that that notion that engineering principle of transmission doesn't largely change um with your so that's um part of why the department is recommending that they can use this experience their experience with these lower voltage transmission lines along with just the long uh historical history of being an operational utility as part of the basis to rely uh on their organizational expertise to support the standard yes councilmember um thank you mr dean and again along those same lines um this the transmission line is significantly longer than is 72.7 miles the longest that i don't know power has constructed and it can the same thing apply you know yeah yeah um well um i could go to the proposed order so that is from the table but what um so there was this three four this 500 kv right to 500 this transmission line that was 84 miles which is significantly much more um that and one thing to note here is you know that this we did we did put a pin in time right when we deemed the application complete and then wrote the draft proposed order um so i i don't know um what has happened in the last four years but that we can't we can't really we can't really think about this we're really looking at just what this is what this says right and my question is based on um given the department's experience um is there nothing particularly significant about a line that is 300 miles versus 84 mile you know concepts and construction essentially is the same i've never done a transmission line yeah i mean well there's then uh i mean when you think about it with the overlay of the council standards right later to today i'm also going to talk about the citing standards for transmission lines right so there's certain like there are there are the the impacts and evaluations under council standards but to me i would go to and maybe maybe it's helpful in this next part maybe that answers it is that regardless of the length of your transmission line that that all of the same engineering and regulatory requirements must be met even if it's a half a mile transmission line or a 400 mile transmission line so i i don't want to say length doesn't matter you don't think i can't say that i can't say that but regardless of the length all of the same um you know checks and balances um apply just looking at experience and expertise and is there something different about it yeah yes okay thank you on that no okay so we talked about idaho power public utility right so it kind of has a different um different different set of rules as far as like the council's uh consideration council has some applicants for other projects that are utilities um but council does often see that um applicants for energy facilities are are private developers um so they kind of have a different um not a different category but public utilities or these utilities um also have an additional regulatory nexus and in oregon that's the oregon public utility commission so they are also going they also um take managed in a regulatory fashion uh the operation of the transmission lines and also some other aspects of just bigger energy portfolios for utilities um but the so the applicant implements maintenance programs for each of its transmission facilities um and so some of and i've talked about some of the the safety reliability standards are from uh nesc the natural national electrical safety code for the federal energy regulatory commission the uh nerc the north american electric reliability corporation and the western electric electricity coordinating council or wek um so and then i had mentioned that there is the the regulatory nexus with the puc so all of these entities um are have either standards codes or some sort compliance or check-in mechanism um so the applicant's also developed its own um maintenance maintenance program and so we have and this is also part of the application is its transmission maintenance inspection uh plan or tmip so on the applicant developer uh reviews this annually um and then every three years there's also web audits and uh which the web audits kind of looks at compliance with those nerc so in accordance with the applicant's tmip or their their um transmission maintenance and inspection plan there's three types of inspections um that occur routinely uh one is the routine controls and inspections one is unscheduled emergency line uh patrols and then one is the aerial vegetation patrols so the routine line inspections include a visual inspection this happens about once a year of the whole entrance that full transmission line there can be either done on the ground or in the air and they're designed to ensure the integrity of the system by identifying you know uh obvious issues and then then there's the emergency inspections which that kind of is like that's exactly what it sounds like there is a problem and it has been reported either by an individual or um through just the transmission system and the remote control of it if there's issues um with the line or tower um then those would be triggered and would be serviced and fixed um and then there's also the um the uh the arborist arborists who regularly um survey the line just to address and make sure that there's no hazardous or trees oh and so that is this yeah that's so that is this recommended organizational expertise condition one um we we have a condition that ties um that requires this tmip and we do i believe i don't have that in front of me but i think that we say oh we want the results of these inspections to be provided in that annual report so that council does get this um i think i know the answer to this but because you call out in this the audit in 2015 and there was there one in 2018 you know i realized there's a time that the application is complete but it's elected an audit looks like in 2018 maybe and then 2021 and is there any look at those you know as we're in this process to to augment the information we have here that's one question and uh coupled with that is in the we don't have a condition i don't remember reading it elsewhere that that web audit is reported to us is it reported to us in any report the web audit um i'd have to go back to see um the applicant likely submitted that information as part of me a division 21 application information requirement um you know it's it's hard because uh the record closes after the record of the draft proposed order right and then the record opens back up again when we're in the contestant case based on those issues that were raised appropriately as part of the contested case and this just wasn't yeah there just wasn't an an issue um uh at this time you know um now of whether or not like when did we deem up complete wasn't it twenty years 2018. i don't know what month but you know it just does something that was oh they they offered it as evidence of how they're in compliance or not no violations and i think that it was more so we were relying on it because we're really concerned about demonstrating the maintenance um for the transmission line and i think that that's really what we were trying to to focus on um no there's not an updated one a lot of it probably was just timing but it was just not an an issue and there wouldn't be anything in like our rules that would require like that that audit that said um is it in this condition sarah the issue so under this recommended organizational expertise condition one where we say hey you guys do your you know inspections and reporting but we do actually have them um right so here like including days inspections issues identified and any corrective actions taken we we asked for that information really if there was going to be something that was like flagged by again that's what's the question is that included here it strikes me as it would be odd that we include it here um substantiating organizational expertise but we don't we don't have times where that continues after the fact and that's a third-party audit so if it if it's included in this condition that's that's fine it's just not made clear again so yeah but the record talking i mean substantively it is so do they have quite a whack on it no they do not and i don't think we want to put that in there but did that provide the same substantive information yes so that's that's all we care about we don't necessarily care about the web you know audit or any of these other ones we care about",

        "text": " knows there's a lot of things on the wall but I think I would not develop your plan around this one specific industry in this one specific point of time but having a broader Advanced manufacturing um you know to where you might want to grow that sector of the economy would just being more flexible and more open-minded because we don't know how the tools and policies will really pan out uh I think there'll be a lot of positive energy and activity but I'm not I'm just a staffer you know I'm not making I'm not I'm not an elected official and I think yeah I think there's just going to be a lot of debate and uh there'll be new policies new programs but and and those will be coming in over multiple years and I think the tendency what I'm hearing is that this focus on high-wage jobs and Manufacturing that offer jobs or have a career path for non-majority populations is going to be a Focus right so obviously semiconductor has started to do a pretty good job of integrating women into the workforce of uh black indigenous people of color into the workforce so uh yeah I I think being flexible being adaptable and that's you know maybe I passed the Baton to Nick but you know one day we might get a lead from a biotech firm the next day it could be a semiconductor the next day it could be a warehouse the next day it could be a pet food company the next day it could be a croissant company it's just it's never you know there there's just keep your tent big enough that you can capture those opportunities that make sense for your community and yeah yeah so I think it's really good call and that does then relate to Nick because Nick may not have been telling me this but I know I think even before Nick got to greater Portland Inc greater Portland used to tease me about the number of types of industries that are our Target Industries they're much larger they're larger than gpi's Target but for the next Target because frankly we don't have the funds to go to trade shows so so we don't go to the trade shows in the Bay Area or do recruitment trips to see site selectors in Atlanta or what have you we're just not in that in that business and but greater Portland Inc has to be much more selective so we are really I'm going to use the term more agnostic I don't know if that's the right term or not we are very pleased to see food production uh manufacturing we now have a company that's in the Machinery production of uh for for for uh Frito-Lay for example there's a company that's doing work for Frito-Lay produces the the uh some of the Machinery that's used for them and for Quaker Oats uh we've got we've got a company that's doing work for SpaceX that's that's going to be growing another 35 000 square feet right uh very soon we can and and that's just the beginning of what we really want to see so I mean we'd love to see some some batteries we don't have batteries and and uh clean tech all that much and Sherwood at this point and so we're really very much open when we say when we see a a a a project list or a project inquiry coming from either business Oregon for greater Portland Inc uh if it if it generally looks like it's going to meet our land ability which in most cases it doesn't we just have to turn away a lot of stuff but we're going to submit we'll spend time submitting for it uh and and with our development partners and try to see if we could qualify and it doesn't have to be semiconductor and and and and that type of thing uh as long as it's some kind of traded sector we're we're very much open to clean traded sector companies so maybe Nick Nick has some Nick has some thoughts on that quick thoughts though I will go ahead and say as a proxy member of this meeting I will also loop back around with Brett Bruce and make sure that he sends his notes to you as well I don't know but uh certainly agree with with uh Colin's comments and do appreciate the comments of of Kirk and Suzanne as well I think especially as they relate to land availability and site Readiness um in within my purview in the business attraction space on a regional level you know I don't have uh any any suggested edits to the language there on some of the uh the goals and deliverables I'll think on it but I do want to emphasize uh the the importance of time to Market as a as a meaningful and compelling way to keep Sherwood sites on site selectors and on companies lists as they evaluate Sherwood and the region for for future investment and that comes down to how um you know you can get a site annexed or how quickly you can move through a permitting process because time is money as we all know um so I I think that you know priority prioritizing those things make sense and I think we'll stand the test of time uh to Colin's comment about you know Trends um and uh yeah I think let me think on a little bit more Bruce and get back to you yes okay I don't mean to put you on the spot I I I just started to think I'd start calling on folks to see what their what their thoughts are who have I not called on yet who would maybe like to comment I'll jump in um this is Lee from dlcd I just following up on Nick's comment um you know there there is a requirement that cities in Metropolitan planning um keep 25 of their employment land Supply and short-term Supply but I can tell you uh from my desk that I don't see a lot of cities who are actually keeping up with that and the more that you can emphasize continually moving through that cycle um of bringing you know bringing these sites to Market consistently uh the better position you'll be in to benefit from all of the economic opportunities that are coming both through you know state and federal Investments on the horizon so I think that I think that would be an excellent policy to make sure is included in your AOA um but also one that you know maybe has some enforcement shops in it locally because that's that's where we often see a Slowdown okay good that's a great Point Lee because that's what we run all the time is people always underestimate how long it's going to take them to actually get a site truly online and available and even the pros developers underestimate it so a company where it's not their core line of business uh absolutely and yeah I really like Lee and Collins and Nick's points a lot um Colin talked about flexibility and I do find that in the current uh EI development code uh or code for that particular Zone there are a lot more industrial zones out there that sure would should really stay away from um you know there are some municipalities that just say no distribution and as a developer it's it's really hard to make that investment if you come across um you know particular uses that are just outright uh not permitted um you know each building I mean the building's behind me which is the uh you know in in Sherwood on the south west quadrant of of TS Road and 124th you know they could have been distribution buildings too um you know we we got lucky really uh there was there was more demand that needed something faster in the advanced manufacturing space so which leads me also just to another point I want to make where you know we should all be cognizant of that objective of of you know the the quantity of jobs relative to Advanced um they're kind of counter to to one um Advanced manufacturing is an operation that doesn't require a lot of um and so maybe one way to think about it not necessarily exclusively but in conjunction with is is you know that capital investment of a particular facility and another thing I'll just say on the industrial zone for Sherwood you know it makes the buildings look good because you have to have 15 percent glazing that faces a major road three materials on the buildings these sort of things I think are appropriate rather than limiting uh limiting uses um uh to create some jobs but again you know just caution on on the quantity of of jobs relative to Advanced manufacturing okay good point who else would like to chat provide comments that uh we could fashion that into uh recommendations in the eoa it's a great discussion comments I have a few specific code Type items and then I think maybe just a broader thought about development review process um so a couple of really specific little things that have come up one is actually kind of related to par uh employment is the parking minimums and um and maximums are limited by Metro well Metro sets that so they're pretty much the same in most jurisdictions but there is sort of an ambiguity in the Sherwood code about parking for warehouses over 150 000 square feet which is a little bit weird so looking at it's kind of unclear whether the lower ratio applies to the first 150 000 and then the higher ratio applies but I so I don't know how much flexibility Sherwood has to look at their parking code because Metro has set the limits anyway but this is something that we're seeing across the region is that a warehouse today is very different than a warehouse when these parking maximums were set 20 30 years ago so we're getting we're requesting parking adjustments or typically processed as instead of variants for you know FedEx distribution facility some of that's maybe not quite as likely in Sherwood but even for so for crosstalk warehouses I've even had them for other warehouses where it's just a standard warehouse but they just have more employees now than the big old Mattress Warehouse they're just they're just more efficient and so these are usually approved because we have shift data to show that we have more employees than you thought we would um but it's like when you just keep getting an adjustment every single time like the code should be looked at so like I said I'm not sure if that's how flexible that is um but parking ratio for warehouse is one and then the variance process it's I'm pretty sure you have the class a variance which is well you know there's like the smaller Erica could comment but um which when once you go above a certain type of variance or adjust adjustment variance you have to still have to demonstrate hardship and so it's just you're getting that higher level of variance because of your percentage of variation from the code but sometimes I mean again this may",

was a great visit I do want to call out to Marnie and Jess Larson Barney Kyle and Jess Larson and the whole entire housing team under marnie's leadership really put a great presentation for the the congresswoman really elaborated and explained uh the the purpose the reasons and and the lives we're saving by housing people in the building it was a really great experience and great conversation to be part of yes I did uh so I carried forward I think our board chair Harrington and some knots in the head made a recommendation to do some ask to the congresswoman and she really appreciated those asks can you remind me what the ask was yeah so we uh I'm a quite known paper um you know obviously we needed uh some increase of federal funding uh homelessness is not really something that we could just attack at the local level we need every partner at the regional level at the state level and the local level and the federal level to provide uh there's a comment about this uh our board saying that this was the last time some of the fundings um were even discussed at the federal level was the Reagan time was the last time so she resonated with a lot we talked about you know really needing help to tackle this funding challenge in this problem so it was a lot of those Nationwide problem and we need help tackling this challenge a lot of those Runners some of this discussions that we had and some of the things to carry forward as the board representative attending that it's a really good discussion uh a lot of the boots on the ground really brought forward even bigger and and some as that was really important to the congresswoman I feel like they shared some experiences some of the real challenges and the federal level barriers that could cause people to be homelessness and besides the funding that we brought forward so that was really good experience kudos to our staff kudos to every Community partner organization that was there there were quite a few people that a lot of people showed up and it really made the congresswoman happy to see a great turnout and and I did let her know that all of our board members couldn't attend I'm here and did the welcome and did a whole you know let us feel about hardwood Commons in District One in some of our good work so Kudos money and just Larson and your team and Metro was in prisons quite a few teams of Metro was there so we really did demonstrate the ask from our board to say look everywhere you know the the collaboration that's here we just need your federal funding give us more money in and she is going to work hard and Aaron Doyle Aaron Doyle our government relations was in the room so I think it will we'll get some money hopefully right Aaron just because Aaron was there yeah the lobbyist the lobbyist is in the room so uh so a good um Good Tour congratulations very well organized very well organized and that concludes my update yeah well I have a tour tomorrow as well with a want to meet you Hillsboro where congresswoman bonamichi and um and of course County staff will be there as well City Hillsboro so what are you going to take a look at continue this um where are we going to do we know the hills oh very good okay yeah that Hillsboro shelter site that's great yeah oh yeah the the right by the WinCo yeah all down so yeah and then of course uh I canceled all of my vacation and all of my meetings to be at Tom's retirement party oh thank you thank you I appreciate it prioritize that Tom yeah just just noted it's the only Commission of this anyway um well with a little luck I will be on an airplane and not delayed by weather or other logistics yeah so I would rather be celebrating on Friday right yeah me too I cleared my calendar for because Jerry that's right I also had a GPI meeting this last week um they've had a couple of marketing consultants you know working for a GPI to try and first of all work on gpi's messaging and enhance their membership and certainly their focus um in in the Portland region and then they also have another consulting company that's been working how do we enhance uh Portland's National image I've talked about the Wall Street internal and the New York Times and others that have written disparaging articles on the city of Portland and so how do we kind of reach out to that our media folks and get them to maybe modify that so working on that I'll cost money to do those kinds of things in which case we need sponsored and GPI would need sponsorships to do that so um so that's their focus I also had lunch today with a person I hadn't seen for quite a while she used to be with PGE she now works with zabtec which um Melissa Rogers so um she explained it to me that when we have especially our data centers when we have a power outage and to the time that they can fire up their generators there's a 12 second Gap in there so they're working with them on battery so battery storage is kind of becoming a big deal PG is of course more interested in that as well as a number of other companies but so I should kind of explain that to me and what the purpose of and why she switched jobs she'd been with PGE for 20 years and decided it was time for a new adventure so she did that but other than that it's a pretty quiet week and we're going to enjoy it because after Labor Day it's back to work so that's all I got here yes according to my calendar next week isn't going to be a quiet week but I am going to enjoy the fact that it is the last week before Labor Day weekend and therefore the month of September so continuing on the theme of the Congress August reset uh last week Congressman bonamichi had a tour of the thprd terpening Center this is related to the Natural hazards mitigation plan and a grant request that thprd has made to Congress and John Wheeler spoke rather well about this and thprd was one of the 11 Partners in that in the development of that joint Hazard mitigation planning project and they approved their Annex to the county-wide plan this spring which was the same day we approved it they requested a 950 thousand dollar Federal appropriation through the congresswoman and if approved it would give them funding to address six of the 17 mitigation actions on their their Annex of the plan that would include engineering studies to address seismic vulnerabilities HVAC and other structural and Equipment limitations at Several of their facilities so for example we had the opportunity to go into the tennis center where they don't have air conditioning for the main part of it just for the office but if they need to House people for a mass event we're going to need air conditioning during the hot summer months similarly better Heating in the cold weather um we also similarly walked over to the um the building I can't remember the name of it but it's where the volleyball courts and the pickleball courts are as well so it was great to physically see the structures and to see where the dollars",

        "text": " limited to 3 minutes thank you thank you no worries we're going to just take a quick technical pause while he finds the presentation I can start at least by um saying good evening mayor and City councilors my name is Julie Hansen um the transp Transportation Planning manager for the public works department and um seeing various presentations pop up in front of me do I need to do do I need to do something else sure sure thanks actually I think I might need some help coming tap dancing right okay I think we're getting there that is very tiny it let's see um are you driving or am I I am okay I'm GNA stop driving dueling mice it's a pretty short presentation so could you go to the first slide I think we want to go to presentation mode okay it's the button right there next to slider we getting there okay well I'll go ahead and start to say um I want to start by entering the staff report and this presentation into the record um tonight we're here for a public hearing on the Salem transportation system plan this is an amendment very specifically related to the alignment of a future collector Street in West Salem um in the area of Orchard Heights and does fairy Road it's okay part of me wants to drive but then I'm scared that I'll mess it up even more you want the next slide I just want can you go into presentation mode it's the button right there next to the slider in the bottom right hand corner there you go that should do it there we go okay great okay now I'm going to drive so currently in the transportation system plan the very small map on the left there shows the alignment of a collector Street alignment in West Salem that travels from Orchard Heights and then Loops back around to Orchard Heights again um using um landard Drive Northwest which is a currently under improved street that was built when it was outside the city limits with this amendment The Collector Street alignment would instead shift and sort of curve over over to connect to does Ferry instead of connecting directly to Orchard Heights therefore landard would become a local street so this map is in your staff report I realize it's also hard to read here um but this is trying to zoom in a little bit and I guess my mouse oh may maybe my mouse will show so the green Dash that you see through here is landard Street as it exists as well as a potential extension of it and my mouse is not going to cooperate so um that's in green so that is currently in the transportation plan shown as both as a collector Street and a future collector that would become a local Street the orange line where it goes from does fairy on the right um and then it goes up to that new street that would become a collector Street and then to the left or for West and North is already in the transportation system plan as a future collector Street connecting up to Colorado um way or drive I'm not sure exactly which one is correct so this is a considered a minor Amendment to the comprehensive plan and the criteria for an minor Amendment are included in code as you can see referen there it's a legislative land use decision and findings addressing the criteria are included in the staff report and in the ordinance bill before tonight so so this is really a pretty limited Amendment but it's related somewhat to the Titan Hill subdivision and so I wanted to just talk briefly about that because I know that there's been some questions around there so as part of the Consolidated land use application um for the development in that quadrant um there the extension of Colorado Drive whether without that name was an alignment was approved the subdivision was done in a way that there there were conditions included that would be applied if Council approves this um Amendment tonight as a collector or if it remains as a local street so the subdivision approval decision goes forward whether this uh tsp amendment is approved or not and that's important because we really it's not really good practice to approve something conditioned upon a council decision that has yet to happen so instead there was an approval that basically said okay if the council decision is this way you go this path if it's the other way then you go this path the key difference between the two is that um if this amendment is not approved then the the street would remain local going over to Dukes FAA it would be constructed with sidewalks but without bike Lanes um if it becomes a collector Street it would be constructed with sidewalks and with bike Lanes there have been a number of questions about the grade of the street and as a local Street there would not is my understanding that there would not need to have been an adjustment to the grade but if it's a collector Street there was an adjustment that was required and that was included in that process and that is because our code has a um standard of 8% as a maximum grade for collector streets this street because of the topography in the area um I believe goes up to about 12% so the question was do we have other collector streets around town that um have similar uh topography issues or similar grades and the answer is yes we do um particularly in West Salem and in South Salem the topography basically doesn't allow us to meet those standards and for that reason we have the ability to get an alternative Street standard approved um as some examples uh Christina Street in West Salem um is about 12% in places and that is a collector Street a portion of Michigan City Lane similarly is about 12% Titan Drive in West Salem as a collector um actually exceeds 12% in places and then it's important to note that does faery north of Orchard Heights which is a major arterial fronting the this site actually is about 12% in this area and the the standard for uh major arterial is actually less it's at 6% um another example not in West Salem is um Lone Oak is a collector Street in South Salem that um exceeds that 8% standard so with that I would be happy to take any questions thank you we do have uh members of the public signed up for comments I think we'll go to them first and then we'll come back for questions okay great thanks first up we have online uh Wen laara Midkiff as a reminder I'd like you to introduce your introduce your name your either your address or your word you have 3 minutes um to testify go ahead am I heard yes Mr Mayor and counselors um good evening for the record my name is I'm a res can I ask you to pause for just one moment I apologize could we get the volume adjusted that's pretty difficult to hear here in the room is there any way to adjust the volume up is this no all right looks like we're if you could just be sure and speak uh clearly and as loudly as possible that would be fantastic and we'll start your clock over again all right I I'll lift my mic up that might perfect thank you um Mr Mayor and counselors good evening for the record my my name is hakin l mkff and I'm a resident of Ward a and I appear tonight to join the wsna and speak to the inaccessibility of colro Drive in the proposed tsp amendment that bounds the Titan he help development earlier this year and Late July when I provided testimony arguing against the approval of the development of the area I suggested that while every development has its challenges and West Salem certainly has many topographical ones as was just alluded to this s in this area in particular was especially ill prepared to the meet the needs of the areas's disabled residents I spoke to the hazards of the two major roadways that bound the development and attested to the reality that disabled and aging residents would face for example being unable to meaningfully access the beautiful parks in nature for which wem is known including notably St Nature Park which is literally across on do's fery and this is not to mention the ability of residents to access the nearby West Salem high school and other local schools in July I wrote that while residents of the development might in theory have access to their living facilities and practice their access to life is significantly curtailed at the time City officials said that bringing the streets into compliance would cost millions and was not tenable the sole Saving Grace this last summer was the city and applicants State commitment to ensuring that accessibility minimums would be met within development carado drive will be used heavily by residents should this amendment move forward as it appears tonight with an unlawful 12% grade despite examples of other grades around the area the city would be permitting a double disservice to our elderly and disabled residents in an already challenging area as a wheelchair user understand that the difference between an 8% and 12% grade is not just inconvenient but burdensome unnavigable and outside of the law the city's commitment to connecting roads and making living living easier for residents is vital but it's an

        "text": " be and then we have the Durban quarry alternative down in malheur County which is proposed to avoid potential impacts to an ODOT Rock Quarry and then this uh is a 2.8 mile alternative which it would offset a 2.8 mile segment of the approved route so there would be no additional length associated with this alternative so the scope of council's review when councils so in in council's Amendment um there's various types of amendments that come across Council uh Council to review some of them are extending construction deadlines some of them are transferring ownership from one certificate holder to another certificate holder some are maybe proposing a newer alternative technology within an existing site boundary um some amendments are requesting to add an area to a site boundary um and so generally speaking this amendment is adding area to a site boundary so the scope of what council is looking at is whether or not those areas comply with the applicable Council standards and rules now for every amendment in your rules it does say we do take a look at the bond or letter of credit to see if it is if that amount is and then um as as we we heard in comments on the DPO and which is is clear in review of the DPO the certificate holder requests amendments to serve a site certificate condition language and that the department also recommended several um to condition language as well to facilitate implementation um to actually give the department more authority to implement a condition um or to um just just clarify condition for implementation so so really you know under even though that is open for uh to be able to comment on um one it could be triggered this area of the council's rules that you're also asking yourself as it relates to the condition amendments whether or not the facility with the changes complies with the laws as well so here's our procedural history slide just kind of reminding us uh where we've been and where we're going um so let's see we issued our proposed order on August 8 and then the deadline to submit requests for contested case for September 8. so um and then so kind of going on that Council received its first staff report on the proposed order on September 8th um and that was uh you know you're you're basically a staff report for Council describing what we did what did we do in response to the comments received on the DPO certificate holder responses and Council direction that you provided us in your review of the DPO um because Council actually did ask us to to to incorporate or clarify several and so the deadline to submit the requested case contested case requests was also September 8th so then on September oh nope uh oh I have it here on September 15 we provided a staff report which also a supplemental staff report which provides our recommendations to counts to council's decision tree here in a little bit as well okay are you gonna just one second there it is there was a delay there um in the um notice of an opportunity to request a contested case as well as in the staff report as well as in the front end of the proposed order um and draft draft proposed order there's a lengthy description of what it is in the process that we go through when we're evaluating a request for a contested case for an amendment this is highly paraphrased because I want everybody to stay awake so uh so and I also am focusing on number three here because just in short um in our staff report um and then there's some asterisks that I'll clarify but we're basically recommending that that the folks who submitted a request and properly raise an issue so right we aren't going to really dive in to the properly raised um but but we we could say if somebody attempted to raise an issue that was outside of council's jurisdiction altogether say if somebody was raising an issue of um being compensated for a landowner lease or something we would be looking at that and saying no that's outside of council's jurisdiction so what we're really going to focus on today is this number three so this is the threshold to get into a contested case so after Council identifies properly raised issue which issues which we're recommending the issues raised in the requests were properly raised the council must determine whether any properly raised issue justifies a contested case to determine that if there's a contested case proceeding the council must find that the request raises a significant issue of fact or law that's reasonably likely to affect the council's determination on whether the facility With The Changes proposed in the amendment meets applicable laws and Council standards so that that is kind of the the question that we're asking ourselves and answering today these are these are our decision trees I'm going to provide these in various various ways um again I'm not going to read all of this I'm going to kind of paraphrase it but um uh your um Council Ratcliffe can help clarify so there's there's three Pathways so if the council finds that the that a request for contested case does indeed meet that threshold that I just end up um identified Council may make Grant a contested case and have and hold the contested case proceeding um on the issues properly raised and so if Council wants to go with a contested case proceeding pathway we will go back to these rules and then we will look at the other items listed in here that that Council would need to do to proceed with a contested case proceeding another alternative that can happen today is that if if Council sees that a request is properly raised but that the issue raised in the request really doesn't meet that threshold for a contested case but Council does indeed see something that should be reflected in the proposed order to substantively change the proposed order in response to a request for contested case then the pathway is we're going to amend the proposed order reissue it and then there's going to be another opportunity to submit requests and then we're back here looking at those at another council okay and then the third pathway here is that if the request is is properly raised but it does not meet the threshold of um whether or not the hold on uh reasonably likely to affect the council's determination on whether the facility With The Changes meets applicable laws or standards if it doesn't meet that threshold and council's comfortable with the proposed order then Council would would um deny the request for contested case and then move on to adopting modifying or rejecting the proposed order um so and I just want to take a minute minute in the room here today I haven't checked the participants online so there may be other folks that are calling in right now but in the room I do have um from Idaho Power who is the certificate holder I have David Stanish their Council and then Joe stipple the primary contact and then I also have um Miss Irene Gilbert who also commented on the draft proposed order and submitted a request for contested case um who's here present in the room so thank you folks coming to Salem um all right so um the department received we received three contested case requests and in those there were four primary issues so uh so miss Irene Gilbert filed a contested case request on behalf of herself and the stop b2h coalition um and though so miss Irene Gilbert filed both of those so really the request is kind of verbatim exactly the same for both of them so the and in that there were two issues identified that are functionally exactly the same as they were raised in the request so one of them is non-compliance with the forest Practices Act or FPA and the other one is the adequacy of the bond uh adequacy of the retirement bond to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition Miss Irene Gilbert filed a separate request on behalf of herself um and it uh it's the failure to notify the public of the ability to comment on proposed site certificate amendments or and the Mr John Williams filed uh contested case request can anyone hear we can hear you we can hear you just fine and then Mr John Williams filed a contested case request on the issue of the availability of cultural resource mapping I'll kind of get into a little bit of the the details of how we've issue statements um here in a little bit so so what how we've framed the staff report and our recommendations and Council and we can and how um uh suggested motion language has been provided to council is to kind of bundle the first two issues together to where Council would be making a decision on the request on the FPA Forest Practices Act and the bond amount together on those issue topics for Miss Gilbert and stop b2h because the request was identical and then make a separate decision on the request for the the notice issue and then a separate decision on Mr Williams request um is does council have any questions or would you like me to proceed in that looks like uh I'm seeing head tonight so proceed pleads so this is just another kind of um highlighting what what we said so Forest practices acts stop b2h Miss Gilbert retirement stop b2h Miss Gilbert the procedural failure to notice of an opportunity to comment on conditions Miss Gilbert and then cultural resource mapping is John Williams from our PowerPoint presentation and go over to the staff report where we have our recommendations and uh if you spend any time uh with the Department we love overly complicated tables uh however I we do think you know once you spend a little time staring at it I think we we like tables because it's a good way to present a lot of information in some cogent and cohesive manner to be able to track the decision making that's designated in rules so this table um which this kind of also doubles down or it this table was derived from the table that was provided in the proposed order which was in um and then that table got plucked out and provided to council and members of the public in our first staff report that table was functionally the ultimate deposition of what was there any change in the proposed order or not in response to a DPO comment Council Direction and a certificate holder response so this table built off of that because as we are aware that is that's what we're building on right um councils reviewed requests for contested case goes back and it looks at how sufficiently something was raised on the DPO what was the response is there still an issue how did you raise your issue and what are we doing now um and then I have stop V2 up stop v2h here up first um and then for Miss Gilbert on this same issue we have the forest Practices Act",

efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project and it's here at howard elementary school and they added a battery storage system and a new potable water well to an existing 50 kilowatt pv system that was on the roof there and as a result of the planning efforts we now have a facility there that includes a um potable water fill station for the community in an event of a water power of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and the school can serve as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the community which is great of course but it also has these water and energy resilience features and the school benefits from energy savings all the time and eweb is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during day-to-day operations as also just wanted to share the schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served during a power outage the battery storage unit shown in black can be charged by the solar and natural gas generator assuming natural gas is available the water well and critical loads within the school are shown in green and then the switch shown at the main breaker ensures isolation from the grid to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines during the grid outage now that this program is nearly up and running the agency has started to hire the staff that will run the program from here uh pandey and krishnaswamy is on the line today and he's our energy services manager and then james kogel has been leading work on the program nuts and bolts and he's

questions you have regarding the program uh if there's any specific information you would like to know more detail on please let us know uh we've got the contact detail for the the program uh on the slide there as well if you have questions after after great and then i stopped sharing i just think um i can go ahead and put that email address and phone number in the chat in a minute but i thought it would just be a little bit easier for a so um does anyone have any questions for us you're welcome to put them in the chat or you're welcome to just unmute yourself and talk away so if it's a small group i'll just ask um so you mentioned that the additional funding rounds uh will be announced uh after this one are you do you know is the intention to do them all within like a couple years or um do you have like an overall goal of how how soon yeah yeah go ahead no you i was just gonna mention the um we have a allocation for this biennium which is uh just less than 27 million um and so we are okay 12 million for the first round and we'll kind of uh release more in the next round plus if there's any funding not spent in this round we'll be able to kind of pull that in um and then the remainder of the 50 million so whatever the 23 million is kind of for the next biennium as well and so that'll kind of through the next years as we'll kind of continuously release opportunity announcements through the next biennium as well so like a four year before your horizon then yep yep and essentially because um we had um it took us a while to set up the program it'll be like a you know three three or four three and a half year program basically yeah but um we also imagine um and i've heard pretty clearly from legislators that this program is popular on both sides of the aisle and could imagine being continued but as of right now that's that's the plan and that's what passed in the statute thank you that's helpful yeah no problem just to clarify that i understood that right that would roll forward if for example the 50 million wasn't fully at the end of that four years uh 2026 or whatever that is that would then roll into 2027. it's the it's around the um legislator that the um state budget timelines which annoyingly run like mid-year to mid-year every two years like no one else but anyway um this program right now has funding for what's called 21 23 and then 23 25 so mid-year 25 the legislature would have to make a decision with any unspent funds they could either roll them forward let us continue the program they could call them back and end our program they could also decide to continue the program and put more money into it so i had another one um the definition of geographic diversity um how will that be applied so a lot of the questions i've had people asking me is um you know is that is that urban versus rural is that uh you know or is that meant to spread projects around the state and uh you know is it unlikely that multiple projects from a single area could be james do you want to take that one on sure so uh the idea behind that was to try and kind of spreading projects around the but it is only a small piece in that scoring criteria um you'll see this it's not work it's not a huge proportion of the total points in the scoring criteria so it's not like if there are multiple projects from a a county that they won't all get approved it's just this we're trying to encourage um opportunities in like different parts of the state um and",

        "text": "It. It. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County Commission planning and zoning meeting for this afternoon. I want to welcome you and ask if you do have a cell phone, if you'll please set that to silent. If you do need to have a conversation with anyone, if you will take that outside of the auditorium. There are speakers out there in the foyer as well as in the courtyard, and you would still be able to hear what's going on in the auditorium should you need to step out to talk with anyone. As always, we always start our meetings with an invocation and a pledge. So if you'll just rise with me, please. Dear heavenly father, we come before you with glad hearts to be able to serve our community as a united board. We ask that you will just bless our proceedings, give us good discernment and direction, and that peace would prevail in everyone's hearts as they share what's on their heart with us as we go through these proceedings. Lord, I just ask that you continue to keep protection and prosperity in Marion county, and we are grateful for all the good blessings that you continue to provide for us day in and day out. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Madam Clerk, if you could please call roll. Yes, ma'am. Chairman Stone? Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Commissioner Curry? Here. Commissioner McLean? Here. Commissioner Zalick. And give us proof of publication for today's meetings. Yes, ma'am. I have proof of publication of legal ad number 100-4322 entitled notice of intention to consider adoption of an ordinance published in the Star Banner newspaper on April 2, 2024. Wonderful. Thank you. And Mister Minter, our attorney, is going to give us all some instruction on how the proceedings will go throughout this afternoon, and I will turn it over to him for those instructions. Thank you, madam Chair. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the best free live entertainment you'll find in Marion county today. All kidding aside, this is an important hearing because property owners have paid significant money to apply for these particular cases that they have before you today. We have three zoning cases and one small scale comprehensive plan amendment. That single small scale amendment is related to one of the three rezonings, and so those two are kind of coming through the pipeline together. It's called a concurrent concurrent plan amendment application and rezoning on that particular case, which is one 2.2 and one 2.3, that's Richard Bernasol in the state of Florida, your comprehensive land use plan is the land use constitution. It's the basic law that everything else has to conform to. So when we have a case like that, a concurrent plan amendment, and rezoning the plan amendment is a legislative policy making decision of the board. You get to the zoning, that's called a quasi judicial matter where the board is acting like judges, but the bedrock is the comp plan. The comp plan has to be, the requested comp plan amendment has to be approved first. If the applicant doesn't get that approved, then the concurrent zoning application would have to be denied because it's dependent on the comp plan being approved first. So as I indicated about the comp plan amendments, legislative things. So that's talking about the Board of county commissioners thinking about policy making for the future. Our current land use plan comprehensive plan is called our 2045 year 2045 plan. It's looking at the future, how we envision development to occur, long range. Again, the zoning applications, they're in the guise of implementing or putting into effect the policies in the comp plan. So when you get to the zoning applications today, what the board has to find for those is that the application is consistent with the comprehensive plan. They have to find that it's compatible with surrounding property, and they have to find that the requested zoning is in the public interest. And so that's what you're here to testify to. It's important that your testimony be factual and firsthand knowledge to the best of your ability. In a moment, I'm going to ask everybody who may give testimony today to stand up, and I'm going to administer an oath to all of you. You'll be under oath for your testimony. And when we have the testimony occurring, we have two podiums. Each one of the podiums has three lights on it, just like a traffic signal. Green, yellow, and red. You get, if you're not the applicant, you get two minutes apiece. And really, you can. You can say a lot in two minutes if you've ever been to a toastmasters meeting, sometimes they have these brief opportunities to say something, and a lot of people don't feel like they can even talk for two minutes. But the important thing is get your main point out first, and probably with this many people, whatever you forgot to say, one of the other people here with you will say it. So make sure you get your main point out first. Address all your comments to the five commissioners. Don't turn around and engage in conversation with the audience or look back and say how many people agree with me or whatever, you know, it's these five people you have to please both the applicant and the opponents. If there are opponents, maybe you're all here in favor of the application. I don't know. The board doesn't know what your position is. But anyway, the drill is that our planning staff will get up first, then the actual applicant or their representative. Like somebody like Mister Tillman out there. He represents a lot of people in land use applications. He may come up after our staff provide additional information. And then the floor is open to the public for anyone who is either in favor or in opposition to the application. That's when you'll come up to the podium. After all of you have finished saying what you have to say. Then as you're saying that the board will take notes regarding any questions you have or any issues that you want the applicant to address. Or if you have specific objections, the board will make note of those. And at the end, we give the applicant one more opportunity to come up and give answers to whatever those issues are to the best of their ability. After that, the public hearing is closed. And your job at that point is to watch the board deliberate. They won't be engaging in any further testimony after the public hearing is closed. So I know that's kind of like making you drink out of a fire hydrant as far as downloading that information really quick. You know, in the final analysis, the board has certain rules they have to follow, certain laws they have to comply with. But a big feature of all land use cases is the board is too, to a certain degree, engage in a balancing activity. We've got private property rights on the one hand, we've got the concerns of the whole community on the other hand. And it's not an easy job for the board to deal with that. But that's what they're elected to do and that's what they will do today. They will make decisions today. So having said that, madam chair, I'll turn it back over to you. Thank you, sir. Are you going to swear them in the. Oh, thank you. Got so wrapped up in my talking I forgot. Okay, if you're going to testify, please repeat after me. I solemnly swear or affirm the testimony I will give today will be the truth and nothing but the truth under penalty of law. Thank you. Very good. Thank you Mister Minter for the good detail on how the proceedings will go today. And if anyone forgets, we'll help remind you because it is a lot of information to take in at once. The first item on our agenda today is item 240411 ZP Sun Golf LlC. And Mister Rison, excuse me, if you would please go ahead and present. Yes, ma'am. This is a case for a rezoning case. It was listed initially on the consent agenda. That was an oversight. It is for individual consideration. In fact, we do have speakers in the audience that are signed up in regard to the case. This is a request to amend an existing pud for approximately 1.37 acres. The site is part of the overall stonecrest development project and a portion of the meadows phase which is in the southwestern or western or eastern portions. Excuse me. And it's requesting a change in the PED development to go to residential use from what was previously golf course recreation open space which represents a change in that acreage and a change in the character. And those are requirements by our code that those kinds of changes must be considered by the Board of county commissioners in a public hearing setting because they warrant that kind of level of review to be looked at. Other more minor changes can be done purely by staff. So this is that upper level that has to come back through this process. That's why it's being considered in this manner. Just to give a broader perspective of where this site is located. These Red Cross hatched areas are the locations. The larger purple areas are the former golf course tracks which are now owned by and conveyed to the property Owners association with the original company retaining these two pieces here as the subject of the request. And then you see other portions of the Stonecrest development. Then also there is an additional golf course that is active on this site. And these are smaller pieces of that in that respective. The current proposal is to create five lots from these holdings, one on the north side and then a series of four on the south side which would then create new housing sites that would be developed. They are proposing that they would conform to the",

        "text": " else it's simply there's not enough transmission to bring resources from the east to the west next place all right well we will go into the project overview at this point the cascade project is envisioned to run about 100 miles it's about 105 and it will interconnect the eastern interconnection is near the existing big eddy substation at the delts it would be slightly above and below the by above on the i mean up up on a hilltop and just short of the dallas dam the western interconnection is envisioned to be the harberton that was recently expanded by portland general if you look at the sort of call outs at the uh toward the bottom uh on the left is two options to get to the harberton substation but i guess i thought was obvious the sort of feature of this project is that other than the converter stations and very very short underground buried uh stretches the project is envisioned to be buried in the columbia river so there's no visual impact there's no overhead transmission lines there are two conceivable options i'm looking at the lower left call out to get to uh from the harberton substation the most likely one is option a where we take it out of the columbia uh bring it for a couple of miles on to a point uh right across from the harvards and we understand that the willamette is a in that stretch is a superfund site it's probably not conducive to uh cable installation in that particular area but it would be feasible if if there were no super fund the middle call out is uh we proposed to take the cable around the bonneville dam there's a stretch i'm sure you're familiar with it on the washington state side that would allow for cable burial it's about two two and a half miles in that stretch and then you would bring it back into the river and finally on the right hand call out you can see where the cable would leave the river south of the bonneville dam or i should say west go another two or three miles up to the big eddy substation all right next so there's three sort of basic to a project like this there's in river construction there are land to water transitions that is such as the bottom milk bypass where you have to take it out of the river and then bring it back in there's upland construction and that primarily consists of a converter station at each end what's a converter station the converter station is to take the ac power uh convert it to direct current alternating current converted to direct uh use the the underwater transmission line take it 100 miles west and then convert it back to ac why do that because the um dc power is efficient it's controllable and most importantly ac power cannot be transmitted 100 miles is the best and really only means for long distance transmission photo on the top is a barge that we used during the neptune project to install the cable in the river the photo on the bottom is an existing converter station it is not one of ours but it belongs to the trans bay cable in san francisco bay the most kind of closest western example of the kind of project that i'm speaking of is called the trans bay cable uh it goes underneath san francisco bay from one of the east bay cities i think it's pittsburgh under the bay and right into downtown san francisco and so that's an example of a converter it looks very very much like a fairly typical uh it has somewhat different equipment to do the conversion from ac to dc or dc to ac the footprint there and the footprint that we're contemplating for each converter station is approximately five acres i would say five to seven acres so it is not a huge footprint for the convert station uh next place uh to talk about in river construction i'm going to start with throw at the bottom because this i think surpr surprises people who aren't familiar with it uh that is an actual slice of the neptune cable and remember the cable carries 660 megawatts and in our case it would carry 1100 and of course it's being compared in size to a typical so what i'm saying is is that well it would be reasonable to envision a cable carrying 1100 megawatts to be massive and require a massive incursion into the riverbed uh in fact that is not the case that that cable right there is has a diameter of about six inches how is it installed if you look at the upper graphic we showed you the photo of the barge typically a barge or a chip feeds the cable off the back of the barge and into a machine called a hydroplow or jet plow the jet plow is basically a framework on and the key thing about the jet plow is the blade you'll see the little plow blade down that cuts a about a 18 or 20 inch in the riverbed and it has nozzles water jetting nozzles fluidize the sediment and as the ship or the barge moves along slowly cuts that narrow trench and simultaneously lays the cable into the trench the fluidized sediment rises up within the trench and then about 75 of it settles back down into the trench so it's it's a one continuous operation through the sediment the plow blade can be adjusted uh not only in terms of the depth but also in terms of for instance the water so that it can be varied according to the nature of the sediment depending on where you are in the river um obviously installation considerations have to uh are you know contingent on what's the nature of the sediment uh whether there's rocks whether there's whether there's utility crossings that all needs to be studied and understood very in great detail but i guess relating back to my previous point this is technology that has been used by has been used in other parts of the world has been used in san francisco it does work if you have the right team including the the contractors associated with it in our case uh our team of cons and constructors were siemens the technology company and frisbee and cables and systems which is a worldwide manufacturer and installer of cables like this both uh land and on land and in water all right next sure grill hi this is prairie choctoo i had a question on your last statement um with the area that you've noted this is going to go in in the columbia a lot of these areas that are covered with water right now are ancient indian villages that were flooded by bonneville dam how are you planning to not impact those inundated uh villages with the placing of this first of all and we'll get to that a little bit later we have had preliminary uh conversations with uh the treaty tribes uh we're quite aware that those uh resources exist the short answer is we plan to avoid you know it's easy enough to draw a line on the map and say okay we're going to take it from point a to point b but as we sort of micro site the uh route the routing of the cable in the you know the good news is that it's i can't say a thing like that it's easy to control but it moves slowly very and uh it is precisely controlled with so we will have already identified uh cultural resources like that uh as well as natural obstructions i mean there's areas where there was a you kind of ancient rock slide steep slopes so we will be microciting the to avoid it what we're not doing is proposing to just sort of ram the thing down the river that's that's the opposite of what we're planning to do thank you uh just to illustrate a little further uh the photo on the the cable itself we refer to it as a cable singular but in fact it's a uh two cable bundle and so the photo on the left shows that bundle is of the neptune cable and as you can see on the right hand it is fed off of turntables uh on the deck of the barge or the of the ship and down into the water and into the hydroplant so it's a kind of mechanized operation that goes that way and you can tell by that photo the relative size of the cable bundle which is like i say pretty small we're talking about a diameter of the bundle of approximately a foot uh the small cable sort of stuck in between is a fiber optic cable it's not for commercial purposes it's for communication on the system itself so it's kind of internal to our cable all right next place okay we'll we'll briefly talk about uh the fact that you know we we will need to move the cable in and out of the uh to go around the bonneville dam and also to bring it on to land to um to get to the converter stations this is a this is meant to be an illustrative uh sort of picture of what that typically looks like uh on the lower right of the um photo you've got the submarine cable coming in there are conduits placed from the land to the river by way of horizontal directional the cable is fed into the conduits and pulled up onto land where it is joined with the land cable there's slight uh kind of physical differences between a submarine cable and a land cable so that has to be jointed the submarine cable and the land up on land in sort of a vault and then it can be buried along its land route until it reaches the point where we go back into the river and essentially the same thing happens only on the bridge we understand that you know horizontal directional drilling is a while it's commonly done you know you need to understand the geology you need to understand what else is there that you shouldn't interfere with for instance around bonneville there are fish passage facilities we're aware of that so clearly it has to be cited cable installation has to be cited to avoid anything that that shouldn't be touched all right next the areas we are looking at uh for the point of interconnection and we have not a specific site control at this point as i said before converter stations require five or six acres each um photo shows the uh vicinity you can see that kind of on the left it says harvard and substation uh what we're expecting is to be able to uh obtain rights to a small portion of some of that vacant land that is across the willamette and to basically drill across the willamette uh to the harvard and the um bottom photo is near bigot again uh there",

please take that room for rent peace out of make it all about the trees in the downtown and the parking says that didn't have a piece of stuff out of this piece of your proposal to the city because I tell already the city accounts it's probably disabled that's what they do with the taxes saw what happens so please look at this cut it into two pieces if you want if you would make it two separate items to send to the city and I wrote a little doctor read about it but this is very disturbing I'm going to talk to Wendy's not happy about what's coming specifics here and I looked at the state bill whatever it was 32.95 and it referred to this so are these room for rent concept but it was to the newly uh called Urban growth factor here it says the urban area in Salem Adams my neighborhood your name is open to this guys thank you your time's up sorry I appreciate you taking the time to come down and share your thoughts and you can tell that you have big concerns about it yeah but before you step down somebody might ask you a question does anybody have a question for Mr Bell I'm wrong but this is being mandated by the state of Oregon and we are simply implementing what they're requiring us to implement so that this Planning Commission in the city council has no discretion on whether to adopt this or not and I was wondering if you were aware of that well I looked at Senate bill or whatever was house built for 3.95 and again it says Urban growth it doesn't say the urban power I don't know if his staff wants to clarify that um since I thought it was directed my information is that there was not a lot of flexibility I think that's correct commissary we will uh bring that up in questions of Staff which is going to be our next section so we'll ask them for some clarification on that yeah um any other questions again thank you for your time appreciate amen thanks for listening now we've got another opportunity for Austin would you like to address that one question the urban growth boundary versus the urban it looked like maybe you just wanted oh I bet she does she's dying uh it has about 33.95 that does mandate that local governments within Network request allow these and so it is it's not just it's almost and when you say Urban growth batteries you made the entire space Within existing properties because she's going to add that good reason we combined this with the code Amendment on the parking lot is that it becomes effective January thank you additional questions of Austin or units at this time for a closely thank you that we adopt case number CA 23-04 is rewards facts and findings and recommend to city council for adoption sure thank you I need a second okay this is our second discussion automation I I like the concept of what's being um I I seriously question if at the state level that the 40 was true embedded with you for making potential conflicts and there's that that 40 percent the reason it gives me some pause is that when we look at site development of property there's percentage numbers that you can use as like a scale so for industrial property we don't want to exceed 35 of the property with building area and that ensures that you have proper circulation for large vehicles and trucks so Apartments retail strip malls shopping leader centers they all have a magic formula number and they'll start to see similarities as you're looking at like retail strip malls a lot of them cover about the same amount of area of the land is other ones that they have about the same percentage-wise of parking so we were looking at this much canopy cover on parking areas the thought of landscape debris vehicle accidents um and we're not talking life or death but Defender vendors the running over it or clipping a tree um there's a part of me that that when I saw you that it initials 48 was just like vaccine is like really too much how is that going to function um the the sample that was put up is the seven Acre Site when we do look at those um retail centers those are much more easier to get to where this mandate came from but when we look at apartments um that's really going to impact developers as far as the number of units that they can get onto a site or the number of prostate parking that they're able to offer because they are going to be taking out parking stalls for these trees I know that we've reduced minimums but we also we are seeing the early onset of the experiment of build marketing and in downtown it has created a decent amount of conversation so I have some some reservations about the numbers the rub for me isn't necessarily the numbers in the start of this because this could also be changing you could go back as a city in 24 months and say this isn't working we had these developments that then withdrew and failed or didn't develop in the city because these added expenses that the developers were able to show and document Etc the rub that I have with this and why I would vote no for moving this forward is it doesn't adequately take into account the industrial property and the the ramifications of requiring islands of trees in the middle of a giant asphalt turn around area between industrial buildings where trucks need to be able to circulate back up yes it's nice to think that okay there might be reasonable interpretation by a planner at that time but that that doesn't cut it for me I I've seen and been a part of too many of adoptions and code amendments where it wasn't applied intelligently it was applied with a broad brush and closed eyes and it didn't make sense I'm not going to do that again so for that um I would not support this in its current form and if my colleagues would be open to a motion to men or a request the staff to go back and add a language to clarify and refine how this impacts specifically industrial um I could get behind either request for additional language or emotion but I would not support this why I go to other people's comments discussion on the mission and then we'll have discussion on that um so I would disagree with that General assessment just as a I do think that this has been a well thought through approach and there are alternate paths to achieving the climate renovation that they're asking for through these different strategies and not fully a la carte approach but at least a comprehensive approach to achieving that goal and I think it's really important for again the long-range vision of of Salem and creating as the state mandate is called climate friendly and Equitable communities and that really should extend across all types of development having been involved in numerous developments myself on the architectural side I it is achievable and it becomes a prioritization within the overall project structure I would definitely support it as currently stated if not as I mentioned thank you Mr other discussion on the current election of the course any other discussion on this question so did you have an additional um so I I I'm in total agreement with commissioner Fox comments um I also recognize that as we try and deal with these questions of a new strategies to combat climate change and create new kind of structures for neighborhood that we're going to create a huge cost problem for the public sector for the private sector and we really have to figure out a strategy that kind of get us there I had talked a little bit with Austin um incentives and what kind of price waves and other ways that we can do to minimize the burden of private sector adopted some of these and I think response is consistent with what he said today which is we need to get this moving forward to revisit that but I do think that's a conversation we have to figure out as a planning commissioner I have no idea what it said those we even have available to discuss so I don't have any idea how to approach this but my sense is you look around indeed it is significant and I think down the road we need to be involved in terms of discussion about issues very carefully monitoring whether we're stopping the kind of development that we need because even if we don't help 40 here for example we still have the green infrastructure land space all the other requirements that'll be worse if we are killing development that will bring in those because we're adding a few requirements on top of that so I just think there's some balancing act that we need to have talked about in terms of the financing of all of this I think the direction is correct we're not fully accommodating the issue of cost so um yes but I don't know how to have that second conversation yeah it's really a conversation that I would have loved to have seen a front end just really make that decision easier to to make I know that you're under the gun to get this moving to meet that state mandate I don't know how we get assurance that we can come back and visit for example how do we incentivize which I've always been you know even on that star Salem let's find ways to incentivize Rhonda with a hammer and I I don't know when that happens I don't know can that happen when will that happen to alleviate some of the Lynn's concerns similar concerns so I know you're asking for us to move because you've got to move it which I get that state requirement but um commissioner Slater's concerning at others it would be great to know that we're going to have that conversation about looking at incentives to defray some of these costs that are going to maybe preclude what we really need in our community housing being environment go take it Lisa do you have an idea about that inspections is urban development of the housing authorities by our department and so the federal funds for housing or no money for housing Etc I know that comes to the Planning Commission um this is not set up that way and so I'm not an expert in the US means except for what I hear Council as I sit and wait for my item um or if we're talking about creating money or using money to better for um then we don't currently have thoughts about money right set aside for that kind of thing but it is something that the planet action plan for my name is cellular design could be looking at and stuff like that we don't count those those parking spaces today we don't look at them as a parking area for a car instead of you know to add up",

community thank you very much comments well I really appreciate I remember back when I moved to Oregon in 1990 and worked for my first private firm here and uh they had a uh heritage month for Asian-American native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community members and it was my first experience uh and my first introduction as I had moved to the West Coast for the first time having been raised in the eastern half of the United States both in the North and the South so I can really speak to how um how useful it is to have Heritage months uh proclaimed and sharing and learning opportunities for community members so thank you for joining us tonight thank you for volunteering your time over these last six weeks on the committee and I look forward to learning more including uh through the various spotlights that I know that our um Horizon's uh employee Resource page will will bring to us as well so thank you and with that Commissioners do we have a motion or so moved second we have a motion and a second to adopt this evening's Proclamation for Asian-American native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you Commissioners any opposed the motion carries unanimously five to zero thank you very much alrighty next we're going to move on to presentations and uh I know we have Matt craigy and uh is Ashley here with us there she is Ashley horn horn here as well uh to highlight uh an important aspect of how Equity is embedded in the kind of programmatic work that is done across departments here in Washington County so please take away thank you good evening chair Harrington and board my name is Ashley horn and I have the honor of serving as the equity policy manager with the office of equity inclusion and Community engagement I am here today to present to you our quarterly report on behalf of the office of equity inclusion and engagement as was shared in the County's recent three-year Equity report there is a lot of amazing Equity work to be proud of here the office of equity inclusion and Community engagement has worked to lay the foundation for Equity diversity and inclusion work and we work in collaboration with departments to advance Equity across the organization Together We Are One County we appreciate that our quarterly reports are an opportunity to recognize and highlight the great Equity work that departments are leading you will be hearing more about this in today's quarterly report as well as in future reports today we will hear from Matt craigy Washington County's economic development manager about all of the great Equity work he and his team have been leading OAC has worked to advance Supplier Diversity goals of the equity resolution and we partner with the economic development team in this work and with that I am passing the mic to our very capable and inspiring Matt craigy oh that very nice thank you Ashley uh good evening uh chair Harrington uh Vice chair fi and Commissioners uh it's a pleasure to be with you all this evening I'm excited to share a brief summary of what the economic development uh team has been up to um there's a lot uh that we tried to pack into five slides and I'm not going to be able to touch on all of it so please do ask questions I know you've got your questions so ask some questions after afterwards and I'd be happy to fill in uh some of the details uh as a starting point and for some context I wanted to Anchor this summary uh and where the program started um I joined the county in Spring of 2021 that feels like a really long time ago and I think you'll remember that spring it was uh right in the middle of the pandemic this was actually before the Delta variant had come through um I was so excited to get this job here at the county and it was all remote I I can't remember the first time I think it was uh months later that I got to meet uh all of you in in person this is also before the American Rescue plan Act was passed the substantial uh Federal bill that has been funding a lot of uh the work that we've been doing at that time your board's Direction was to coordinate Economic Development activities countywide with a focus on unincorporated areas small cities and with strong emphasis on Equity so we've taken those directions to heart and I and I hope that in this presentation you see your vision and imprint on how Washington county is making a difference in promoting Equitable economic development for all Washington County members I want to start with this slide about how we work a county economic development program is given the scale and scope of the county organization the positionality uh sorry for the jargon of the county between local governments Regional governments and the State set us up to work at a systems level to convene to bring stakeholders together and to sure that ensure that the ecosystem that Fosters economic expansion is healthy and strong a centering of equity means that we approach this with uh this collaborative work with a focus on inclusivity access to services and in partnership with culturally specific organizations cbos Workforce Development Partners educational institutions private companies and others you I think you'll see if you look at the top of the slide here we have a few Concepts that we wanted to get up here uh that I think guide the work these concepts are collaboration information sharing capacity building and strategic initiatives these Concepts have defined how the county has in these past three years brought people together to create new opportunities and capacity that form the foundation for business creation and expansion and Workforce advancement there are two images on this slide that I've purposely included to illustrate how uh we work in our program on the left uh hand side that image is of the Washington County small business support network we need a different name for this group it's very long I apologize uh this is a group of business uh support organizations n nonprofits that work together they convene quarterly to Workshop challenges and strengthen referrals to serve small businesses um building Partnerships across the entire County I'd say that name fits that's right seems to be attracting the right set of folks thank thank you Herrington there are over 40 organizations that participate in this forum and again it foreigns that basis of an equitable ecosystem that supports small businesses countywide I will also note that this uh Forum continues to expand we've been including Workforce Development organizations and others that work to support business expansion and Workforce Development we're very excited about this forum the photo on the right is was taken during a recent tour of uh our friends at working Theory Farm a uh Hillsboro based nonprofit that focus on providing meaningful job experience uh for atrisk youth in the picture you'll see folks from alante Moes the Northwest Native chamber unite Oregon the sustainability office uh and others we brought this team together because all of them in one way or another is working on advancing uh opportunities for wealth creation in the food and agriculture sector so again this is another example of how the county is working to bring together different partners to innovate to uh create opportunities for more businesses and Workforce Development now let's get into some outcomes let's talk about uh all sorts the different work that we're doing and again there's a lot to cover here and so I I do invite your questions uh after the presentation on this slide I wanted to talk about small business support we support small business expansion small businesses in Washington County in a number of different ways one of them is through supporting the ecosystem like I've been talking about so I discussed the I gave the example of the network we also bring together Economic Development uh managers and directors from all of the 12 cities in Washington County to talk to talk about economic development at the city level we support trade shows and hiring events for small businesses uh we working with uh other departments uh host the Westside open house which is an opportunity to uh to think about procurement in the public sector giving opportunities to small businesses to contract with the county and others in uh local government uh the access to Capital Forum I want to just give a quick example here uh of ways use this as an example uh to to talk about how we're supporting businesses so the access to Capital forum is a an opportunity to bring together a number of cdfis lending institutions and others that have Capital products for small businesses in Washington County we had a panel discussion and then we talked about what some of the gaps might be and work together it was a really interesting conversation to hear all of these bankers and lenders talking about how they have tried different ways of trying to support small businesses and entrepreneurs uh and it was a robust conversation it was also informational for others other business support organizations we're going to be following up uh with that access to Capital forum for businesses having an event for businesses putting out to businesses in Washington County saying come learn about different ways that you can get Capital to either move your your startup forward or expand your business in Washington County we uh do all of this work in collaboration with other County departments and offices um this is how we work we are a team of four we like to say that we're small But Mighty and actually I'm going to pause and turn around and I think I've got one uh Adrien Chalet from our team is here this evening I think Christian Salgado who is the Broadband coordinator couldn't be here this evening and uh Alisa Brasi who is our management analyst so we are we are four and so we uh we work uh with other departments like oeic with sustainability Public Health land use and transportation we are always talking with them of course in this one Washington County approach economic development is one of those uh disciplines",

        "text": " Colin mentioned my name is Morgan schaer and um I'm here to talk you about the priority climate action plan or what we call the pcap so um slide please I want to let you know that the information that I'm presenting today was done in collaboration with Whitney door at DEQ as well as Zach Baker at Odo the mar due March 1st our priority climate action plan will be a compilation of near-term 3 to five year implementation ready priority greenhouse gas reduction measures there's many requirements for the pcap including a greenhouse gas inventory low income and disadvantaged communities benefit analysis and review of authority to implement shovel ready projects that is just a few of the many requirements for this plan and there are a number of others that we're also working on EB EPA has framed key sectors to address greenhouse gas reductions which are shown in the image on the slide we aren't required to address all of these but it offers a way for us to focus the development of action Oregon is well positioned for this work having already created extensive inventories and future planning uh some of which you heard David talk about today including the commissioner's recent work on the road map to 2030 slide please our goal is to utilize the work already done in our state by building a on existing analyses policies and programs for the 4.3 billion EPA is anticipating to award for implementation grants there will be between 32 and 115 Grants awarded nationally for the general competition that is not many grants with this in mind we are focusing the actions to be included in the peap to also be those that meet the criteria for the implementation Grant and maximize our greenhouse gas reductions for Oregon the development of the peap has been on a short time scale so we are utilizing past feedback and efforts to inform this plan as well as working with other state agencies tribes and local jurisdictions to get input and shape the plan to align goals and avoid duplication of actions we're also collaborating with Metro who is leading the local Peak cap effort with the Portland hillbo Vancouver MSA which was the only MSA large enough in Oregon to also be eligible for planning funds from the EPA under the CP gu we plan to submit a single state Le Grant application that Echoes the peap this approach is in alignment with epa's guidance and makes the state more competitive for the limited amount of Grant Awards and will include local and actions this approach also reduces agencies from keep from competing for the same funds and consolidates resource efforts if funded our intent is to utilize ig's sorry intergovernmental agreements um and memorandums of an understanding to fund existing programs the peap will not represent all of the needed and necessary actions in Oregon to address climate needs again there will be an opportunity for further discussion of actions during the development of the comprehensive plan slide please we will be assessing actions to include in the p peap as I mentioned based on the evaluation criteria provided in the implementation Grant notice so again mirroring our peap to what will go into a Grant application the table here shows the scoring for the implementation Grant emphasizing greenhouse gas reductions within five years as well as that low income and disadvantaged Community analysis that I mentioned earlier you can see that there is mostly emphasis on the greenhouse gas measures via the point allocation um by budget and timely expenditure of Grant funds so those shovel ready projects really will matter on this slide please in addition to those state agencies and local jurisdictions we've also engaged with nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon to identify actions to include in the state's pcap so that they can point to the state's pcap to apply for implementation funds as they are also eligible applicants under the program and in fact there are um specific funds set aside for tribal ini as well not all tribes are developing a pcap um however the Affiliated tribes of Northwest Indians is developing one and tribes within our state and region can point to that in addition to the state's PK engagement with interested tribes in Oregon has guided actions for inclusion for tribal priorities and we continue to build opportunities for DEQ has extensive experience collecting greenhouse gas emissions data as you can see and as you know the largest sector based greenhouse gas emissions is transportation followed by residential and Commercial then industry and then agriculture this data has already helped Oregon time and time again in making decisions around integral programs that will help meet our climate goals so again on the screen here is the sector-based emission inventory slide and here is a Snapchat of the consumption based inventory as David described to you all earlier Oregon also estimates um this submissions inventory and is working on updating them these two inventories together provide a comprehensive picture of opportunities for emission reductions and a very unique approach that Oregon is taking to inform its keycap when you look at the data from both of these inventories there are specific Cate that contribute to the most emissions transportation is the single largest contributor to both inventories next is residential and Commercial which also represents the electricity and fuels used to heat cool and power buildings and finally the next tiest is the waste and materials which includes food and beverage as well as those materials used for building that David also alluded to next slide in addition to the inventories our approach has also been informed with the Oregon climate action plan to 2030 and the associated transformational integrated greenhouse gas emissions reduction project report for Tiger Tiger underscored the importance of our existing programs and regulations to reducing emissions which in the context of peap are also key for funding shovel ready projects Jer also identified a number of additional actions to accelerate emission reductions with the most in the transportation and building sector and while tiger only focused on sector-based emission reductions the road map identified the potential and need for action on materials management and other efforts that would reduce consumption based slide informed by all of the above as well as multiple other analyses and resources we've been working to focus the peap our proposed focus and Associated possible actions are aimed at addressing those areas that contribute the most the state's greenhouse gas emissions and have co- benefits this includes and there probably no surprise Transportation commercial and residential buildings waste and materials management we are still receiving valuable Concepts from partners that we are evaluating with the grant Lans and reviewing data support actions for the inclusion of the SL I'm going to dig a little deeper in that Transportation category so this SE is the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions in the state comprising an estimated 35% of overall contribution medium and heavy duty vehicles are responsible for 7.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gases while light duty is actually at 12.1 million metric tons of greenhouse gases potential actions to include in the pcap and then the grant include light duty zero emission vehicle incentives for low and moderate income medium and heavy duty zero emission vehicle incentives and supporting development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure reducing greenhouse gases from Transportation also will have significant co- benefits including the reduction of particular matter which um especially impacts environmental justice communities throughout our state slide please Heating and Cooling of our buildings account for a significant amount of greenhouse gout commissions incentives to improve the efficiency of existing buildings and also support energy efficient new buildings include things such as weatherization Appliance upgrades which might be heat pumps or energy efficient water heaters incentives to build new buildings beyond the standard or Base building code to achieve additional Energy Efficiency so that's referred to as reach C buildings also impact the climate through the act of construction and manufacturing the Mater manufacturing the materials that go into them reducing embodied carbon of projects at whole building and product specific scale these actions offer a lot of co- benefits including improved indoor air quality especially from Wildfire smoke and our rural like so this one tags along with some of the work that um David already presented to you today but a new analysis of EPA reveals that 58% of methane emissions from us landfills is result of wasted food and the emissions associated with producing that wasted food in the first place is six to seven times higher example actions to address this might include expanding the Pacific coast food waste commitment industry partnership grants for food Waste Recovery infrastructure such as and arobic digestors or composting and grants to enhance landfill gas controls another priority that has been highlighted by the White House Council on Environmental Quality is to reduce emissions resulting from the use of single use Plastics through grant opportunities such actions will also support many communities including rural areas indirectly through job and directly through reduction of slide in summary we're excited to continue the development of AAP actions with the lens towards a competitive climate centered implementation grant our timeline and next steps are to have a draft peap out by early January that then then we'll have um a month for public comment so starting in early January to early February and then a final peap is due to the EPA March 1st implementation Grant applications are due one month later April 1st 2024 and along all of this we'll continue to focus on the development of that comprehensive climate action plan due in August of 2025 thank you for your time today that's what we have to um present to you if there's any questions let us know thank you Morgan and Colin and just to clarify or make sure we're tracking it the the governor has asked the commission to review and approve the recommendation so I'm assuming that we would do that after the public comment period uh in February is that correct I'm going to defer to Zach because I'm not actually um sure if you're having a meeting in February so we might have to um work work that timeline out specifically yeah thanks Morgan and I think that's uh with the legislative session there was some worry that we might not be able to get everyone together and so maybe thinking about the approach similar to what we did with a road map which was to have the recommendations informed by the public comment come to the commission and then the commission uh provide a thumbs up on the recommendations while then staff uh finishes up the the last uh cleaning up of the report and writing of the report so um thinking our next uh global warming commission meeting or uh organ climate action commission meeting uh we were thinking would be towards the end of January which would give some time to be able to um see what public input is coming in and shape that and so maybe the week of uh January 2 second or a couple days after that it would be nice to make sure we get to see as much of the public comment",

        "text": " and so and then we have under this um sub 35 of the uh noise control regulations there are just give me a moment i'm going to check with my notes to see if i need to go back to my powerpoint and if i'm on target here with what i want to say okay very good um before i go into exceptions and i'm just i'll just leave these here but i wanted to talk about um and to give some background about ambient or baseline noise levels so here really what we're doing and these are for all of council's facilities what is modeled is the worst noise that could potentially come out of a proposed facility so with other types of facilities we generally talk about for example with like a solar facility what is the noise generating equipment and it's usually associated with the transformers and the equipment associated with any battery storage and we they have an applicant has to model the most possible equipment that they're proposing and put that into their noise here um part of the the noise the noise the maximum or worst case noise that we're talking about is the corona noise and so what the applicant has provided in exhibit x which has information about noise is the worst case noise sit or a situation where corona would be the worst so that is that is kind of one bundle of assessment that that goes over here but then because these are not existing facilities these are proposed facilities so we're projecting ahead and we're modeling and part of that modeling has to take into consideration the existing noise levels at a site and that is the baseline or an ambient noise level because and we can just run a scenario of say that we had a facility or this facility was criss crossing or right adjacent to i-84 as opposed to maybe hanley's house which is rural and you know nestled and it's very quiet and peaceful out there the ambient noise next to i-84 is going to be louder and so therefore any noise from the corona noise from a transmission line even in the worst case scenarios when it's the loudest likely would not even be heard because the ambient noise is so out at hanley's house it is very it's it's rural and it's quiet your ambient noise are the sounds of maybe dogs barking in the distance and birds chirping and some back maybe traffic far away airplanes these are the ambient ambient noise levels so this is what the applicants all applicants have to establish and so that there is ambient noise monitoring where the applicant goes out into the field positions monitoring devices and measures during the day and during the night in in time spans and then and then takes the most again we're applying the most conservative assumptions so usually what's used is the ambient noise level in like late late night early morning when it's just the quietest and that is the ambient assumed for that site all the time so it's it's the most conservative and then we add that we take that ambient and then add on the projected maximum corona noise and that's how that's what is applied to that ambient degradation standard of the no more than 10 dba per hour and the maximum noise so those are kind of a very high level summary of those two and we we will get to this and the applicant has conducted that modeling and there are several areas where the applicant does not meet or anti-ambient degradation standard so the noise level in any hour would be more than 10. so there are several instances in this so an applicant in its application has requested counsel apply consider and an exception to the noise rules they also are requesting a variance to the noise rules in these situations so i'm just going to work that's we're going to look at these rules here and these are this is the findings that are provided in the proposed order so for an exception upon written request from the owner this would be the the uh the department may authorize an to these noise rules that i've talked about and then these are the circumstances this a through e the circumstances under which an exception may be granted um the applicant is representing that the corona noise would be an unusual and or an infrequent event and provides evidence to support um that so that's the exception so in here it tells us tells us to point point here so go here so we're going to go there now this is exciting so here we are and so this is what this is what the department does we read rules and we see what an applicant gets us and we draft findings so in establishing an exception department shall consider protection of health and safety and welfare of oregon citizens and then we also consider feasibility and cost of noise abatement the past present and future patterns of land use relative timing of land use changes and other legal constraints um for exceptions the department shall specify times um so all of these items in here the department has evaluated in the proposed order and made made recommendations so each of these aspects is is represented in the proposed order and then and and so the council as the decision maker for these rules um is has the authority to do this evaluation and grant or deny these exceptions and apply the noise the applicant is also requesting that council consider a variance to the noise rules so the commission may grant may grant specific variances from the particular requirements of any rule regulation or order to no no for such specific noise sources upon conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health and welfare if it finds that strict compliance with rule regulation or order is inappropriate because of conditions beyond the control of persons granted such variants or you know so we're going to go procedures for requesting this is the second part in the proposed order where there is an evaluation and recommendation for council's um okay let me go back here did that was kind of a lot of rules and i we can go back to that and maybe i'll just proceed um but if council has any questions about we can do that now or at the end so just give me one minute i'm almost through here i had these snippets of rules in my powerpoint and i just thought that it was better to actually just look at them so under uh there is a table nc4 which is the summary of acoustic modeling result results comparison of predicted facility sound levels to late night baseline it provides the results of the applicants noise modeling so this is establishment of the baseline at and then it also and and so it includes the baseliner ambient and then their maximum modeled and in that table it does include the results of the anti-ambient degradation standard so the increase of 10 dba per hour but it also has the results of the maximum allowable and the mac in that table the maximum noise at any um and i forgot to give counsel the background council has heard it before in the deq noise rules they call them noise sensitive properties in general those uh council can think of those as their their properties normally used for sleeping that's a very that's part of the definition but it's a residence that's what we're looking at um they're called noise sensitive properties in the application and just in the department's vernacular we commonly call it an nsr or a noise sensitive receptor so the nsr or noise sensitive property that has the which would experience the loudest noise it would be at 47 dba which is underneath the 50 dba which this is that table 8 that those noise rules pointed to this is just taken out of deq's noise rules and again we're kind of looking we're going the most conservative which is the l50 when council sees the l50 l50 is generally the statistical noise level that is the quietest so everything is kind of the most conservative application within these rules so the the and so when we talk about maximum allowable 50 dba is that threshold because it's in here it's the most conservative it's the lowest noise the in that table at the nsr it would be 47 so we're recommending the maximum allowable noise standard is met that concludes my portion thanks kellen so um we have four issues that uh are part of the contested case that exceptions were filed on related to the noise standard we're going to take those issues one by one so our first issue is nc one the limited party here is stop dth the issue is whether the department improperly modified slash reduced the noise analysis area and exhibit x from one mile of the proposed site boundary to one half mile of the proposed site and whether one of the department's application rules one of the application materials rules in division 21 requires notification to all owners of noise sensitive property within one mile the proposed um contested case order opinion the hearing officer found that department's application rule does that an applicant identify and address and include addresses for noise sensitive receptors within a mile of the boundary um a separate council rule allows for the department to modify the information to be required in an application for site certificate if that modification is reflected in the department's project order we've heard about the project order a few times and again that is the document that is intended to provide the roadmap to the applicant for the standards that are going to be required to be met in the application the in this case the project order was amended a couple of times so in the second amended project order the department modified the requirements of the application the application requirements to accommodate the linear nature of the proposed facility and establish that the extent of the names and addresses that must be identified for noise sensitive extend to a half mile from the site boundary rather than a mile so uh one of the issues raised by stop bth was whether or not the department's authority to modify these application requirements are limited to a situation the applicant has made a written request to waive requirements the hearing officer found that well that provision does authorize the department to modify requirements upon the applicant's written request it does not preclude the department from otherwise establishing on its own the applicable application requirements in the project order separately um and you know getting a little technical here but the the um the rule refers to the the mile uh boundary um the hearing officer found that that's not a requirement for issuing public notice uh public notice and entities that must receive notice are addressed in separate department or council rules that further the the rule at issue here does not establish or define the noise analysis so the hearing officer's ultimate conclusion here was that separately from modifying the information requirements in the the department acted within its authority and established the noise analysis area in the second amended project order as the area",

cover it is a drone that I hear all the time but you know I I signed off on it so I can't say much and you know around like how long it would be until those um decibel tests are performed is that going to be like in the next year is that going to be when the whole you know construction of this project is completed and if so can we do like something in the meantime like you know just on that Bess site you know maybe do a a decimal you know test and adjustment needed yeah I mean Ryan or I I can take that you do the analysis as per the the sighting rules pre preconstruction as as part of our pre-construction because as of right now as as Chase said the layout is preliminary and as we get into further design and we actually um start ordering equipment or start knowing what we want to order as far as equipment like the precise equipment then we uh update those and we come around to to the land owners um and and and discuss those so uh rather than a spefic specific time from now it would be within um that preconstruction usually you know the the months and and more leading up to construction now in to to um address exhibit why the applicant has has conducted predicted noise levels in exhibit y uh like already um so and they the applicant exhibit y goes into potential measures to uh reduce noise levels um and explains its compliance with the noise regulation so exhibit Y which is on the project web page uh is where you would find all of the data to date on noise including uh evaluation of acoustic modeling yeah and we'll we will uh you know hearing this as it we will come to you and um your your neighbors which are all family members and we'll we'll have a further discussion Lo um you know by all means I got one I'm Stanley Ral and my house is right in the middle of on the North unit now and right next to the main power line it goes out to the river now after looking at the map it's within it's within with 100 yards or so of my house that M and the the uh Transformers and it's going to be just across the road in Kil K now for me that's too darn close now when Chris came up and mentioned that this is where the proposal was at cuz he's farming all this ground around around me and as now well we were wanting it to move clear to the far end which would be next to greps and Kil Kines and starvation Farms which would tie into to the North or excuse me to the north east west side your transmission line between the two would not have to go as and I wouldn't have to put up with a rope going within 100 yards of my house and have to eat all the dirt which is which would be right underneath the rway the transmission line going out now I know this is not set in stone yet so that would be my brothers Chris and I proposal that it goes to the far end it' be all by itself and it would be take up less Farm ground and it be easier for Crystal Farm I wouldn't have to sit there and would I'm tired of practicing or whatever and have to worry about what's going on on on next to my shop or have traffic going by me all the time I don't have to put a fence all the way up just to protect my house and thanks with T's talking about noise the only noise I get is I'm about 500 maybe 600 feet away from the closest Tower I hear moaning and groaning like hey do I really have to turn that's only when the wind is blowing in the right direction you get to hear it thank you Stan um we we will the first thing I want to point out is there's two potential substation locations one is actually down Strawberry Lane further to the currently West uh south and west of the existing Blue Ridge substation right next to or very close to the existing onm building and um and so that is the what we would call the primary location the secondary location was as you described and we will um we we'll take that it's part of the public record and we will come and dis and discuss those with uh uh W with with you and Chris okay thank you and if I if I may add um the location of a proposed facility I mean specifically we're talking about the wagon trail solar project is is nothing that the department um and change we review and evaluate what the applicant proposes so it's what what wherever they propose their facility is where we review and evaluate um but would what would be a great uh or an effective comment on the record when we get to the DPO is if you had concerns about noise or um other impacts relating relating your comments to specific standards so that it can we can follow the follow the train of thought as it's linked to a standard well that'll probably come up in the next session well one battery storage but you group of together that would be do they take test the sound on all of it together or is it just based one if they're going to group them all together that's you know yeah no it it's based upon actually what we design the number and and the facilities that we okay I'll go ahead and ask question and if there's anything else just let me know um so case um in the outline I believe that um Chase was giving up for the process and where we are now um it stated on the chart that uh that the public hearing would be sometime in February and if possible I'm hoping that we can come up with a date um if not tonight which would be great but if not tonight then definitely before the end of the month because um I make a Lexington newsletter and I would like to put that date whatever date in February that you do that do have that D phase in the public hearing I know that there was a lot of um a lot of interest in this meeting and as you know um with the inclimate weather and everything I we're being we're dealing with it right now too we have free rain outside there's a lot of people that wanted to come tonight but maybe didn't because of the weather so if I could give them enough notice um and then also uh that there would be public you know the whole DP any information that you could give me for the DPO phase would be great before the end of the month so I can notify um our town people you know we have a sense of community that we've been working on and and you know just to be involved and to hear and just to know that our comments are being heard as well I think that that a lot of people have already the a part of that so I want to know that I want everybody to know that they have that option sure I appreciate the comment and we'll uh keep you as uh informed as best I can with with our schedule thank you um and then I have one question um for Ryan Ryan Hill you had somewhere in your presentation um that the energy operation of this project would not discharge or consume any water in the process of energy operation but what about in the construction process do you have um would it be con would you be consuming water that's my main concern in the construction process um yeah I believe I don't know off the top of my head what exhibit it is but we cover our water use and it would would be um I believe it's exhibit o as an Oscar um and it's basically saying you know for fire prevention Fire Control dust control um kind of those sort of things in the construction process um and then as um people know with the current side out there Strawberry Lane is currently a gravel road so water is currently being used um whenever it's really dry to keep to mitigate dust on the panels and adjacent residences and I just wanted to confirm exhibido is correct that's water requirements and that exhibido goes into an evaluation of what's needed during construction and operation as far as water is concerned actually I'll just look at exhibit of water consumption and then if I have any um comment on that I will bring it up at the public here well we can if you go back I know you weren't here then but during the construction they did use water water for packing the roads water to help the dust like you s through the dust but they went to other farmers in the within Mar County and bought the water and they just Ed mainly all it was for was dust control packing and not the water of the weeds but any yeah they didn't use it oh I have another question for Ryan um when can you tell me which one is Phase you got uh phase two and phase three at on the map and I when they plan to start this you know when you go down 207 you come to Martin is that phase two or three or one be on uh strawberry yeah so phase construction right now what's planned and it's preliminary is but we'll kind of be constructing radially out from um the substation and so close to the bluid substation will be the initial construction and then from there um as a project Bros will expand outwards so you're going to go west north off strawberry and then cross over into Kil kenes and go south by West okay yeah this is first yeah this is no this is this is this is lindsy and Martin you got you got kill Kenny you got Martin and then you have are there are there any others in attendance in Lexington that have um any questions or comments uh otherwise I'll I'll turn it over to the webinar and and ask we have any participants via the webinar that have any questions thank you Chase I do see that uh Miss Carla mlan has her hand raised uh Miss mlan I'm gonna unmute your mic and you are going ahead for asking your questions Carl mlan uh I'm the city of Boardman planning official um I served as a County planning director for about 17 years left the county at the end of 2019 my question um is not really specific spefic to the standards but has more to do with the applicant's approach to your construction housing if you wouldn't mind doing a quick summary of what your anticipated approach to that's going to be um we had",

        "text": " i'm going to turn it over to tracy but i'll um as she's getting off me i'll just put what she had in the chat or verbalize it she was if they're in a high risk area but not a high risk utility according to their plans if they would still be eligible for example um they're a lower risk utility in the center surrounded on all sides by high risk utilities um so adam you might want to address that and i think we can take tracy off mute in case you want to discuss it yeah i'd be curious um tracy which utility um you're you're with um i didn't catch that if if um someone mentioned it but um it looks like we're having technical issues trying not need folks but there we go can you hear me now yes um i'm with springfield utility board so we are in um we're landlocked service territory as you know by so low risk by nature but we're surrounded by all the high risk utilities so while we're in that highlighted red zone that you've got we don't have the same requirements to take care of wildfire mitigation so but we do have some that would fall under the scope of wildfire so would we still be eligible then to participate um i i don't see why not i might uh you know the way we're trying to set this up is really have it set up based on some binary data layers from the state now we recognize you know they may not be ideal but um certainly lane county including springfield was um severely impacted by the 2020 wildfires shows up in some of those other areas so so that's good to know because well our plans are not high risk per se because we are insulated by the others we still are impacted by those that we surround so i just didn't know because it mentions the plans but and admittedly you know um you know i think in an ideal world we'd like to be able to competitively score um applications and and um but given the complexity and the diversity of investment types um we don't want to rush into that without thinking it through so we'd like to think that through more with stakeholder feedback over the next year in anticipation of years two through five and it looks like richard do we have other questions yeah thanks tracy um yeah from tucker he was wondering if he was understanding correctly that a project has to be located in an area that is both on the fema qualifying map and within a forest protection district no i was proposing there and this is sorry for little bit of confusion with with all the maps i was proposing an ore there so it'd be um sort of a combination of what i'm trying to capture is areas recently impacted plus areas at high risk um obviously there's gonna be a lot of overlap in those two areas uh but the area is at high risk is a little bit more expansive than those that have been recently impacted that was my that was my thinking behind that but again i'm certainly hoping for feedback and looking for feedback as you think about this approach great thanks um adam there was another question about um community engagement and whether the bulk of these types of technical utility hardening projects is appropriate with community engagement and if we could explain a little bit more about what that could entail and i see janine came off and maybe she wants to talk about that one yeah thanks ruchi and thanks for the question jennifer this is an area we'd love to work with folks on and as adam said during the presentation really what we're trying to do is make sure this isn't a check the box exercise and that projects that come forward as benefiting disadvantaged communities and working with disadvantaged communities there's a way that the applicant can demonstrate that so we're open to feedback on how an applicant can demonstrate that they benefit and they work with disadvantaged communities as described by the us department of energy we have we're contemplating developing a an addendum as it says that sort of guides you through some questions to be able to demonstrate how you've worked with those communities uh and and we probably won't have the details of that ironed out before we submit this application but look forward to um working on those before we you know start distributing the funny the money or putting out the application details and i'd welcome adam or jen weighing in if you have anything to add no i don't i don't think i mean to add to that um anything mercy jen just came off yeah so i will just add that um as part of the biden harris administration's emphasis on the justice 40 initiative it is the federal goal that 40 of the funds um under under this program benefit what um disadvantaged communities or tribal communities and so this is um part of uh our understanding of of the initial guidance that has been put out from the federal administration of how to best engage with these communities make sure the benefits flow towards great thank you another question came in from joshua about whether there is potential overlap with eligibility for odo's state-funded community renewable energy grant program in combination with this federal funding opportunity and if so whether there might be challenges in project planning and scope due to the two funding uh streams of their specific requirements and whether odo could assist with coordinating that i'll start but would welcome adam and others to jump in with this one um you know there is maybe some overlap uh in some areas but uh we don't currently have a role in um assisting with coordinating that however we do have a legislative concept and a funding request in um to be considered probably in the 2023 to create a navigator uh program position that might be able to help with um adam do you want to speak to any of the overlap and eligibility that might be the case you know i i have not given too much thought to that i see um i think janine may have something to add on that yeah thank you um there is certainly some overlap in some of the types of projects i did want to point out that there's one big difference which is if you go back to the list of eligible activities shown one of the things that can't be funded with this funding this federal funding is uh electricity generation and the community renewable energy grant program is specifically for real energy generation there may be some overlap with the plan brands that we can look to explore in future years and certainly we do want help uh utilities and other applicants that over but um it's not a it's not a clean overlap yeah that's great um i do think that there might be some opportunity to think about that question a little bit more with the advisory committee as well um so i think it's a really great idea joshua that we would love to explore with you you know i also want to add here routine i don't know if gen center might want to add some detail but there's we recognize there's a little bit of in the federal language around so as janine mentioned there is an ex explicit exclusion of and i forget the exact language it was on a slide earlier but large-scale generation and um you know it's not entirely clear what what they're intending to exclude there because on the eligible list they do include microgrids uh which um would seem to include some some types of generations so um there's a lot of interest in getting some more guidance from usda we own what's in and what's out in their mind in that in that regard yeah that's a great point and i think that as we learned more from usdoe we're happy to share that and maybe have that be incorporated in the advisory committee process for subsequent years but we have not heard back on that question yet um another question that came in um is austin jackson based on the timeline how soon will resources be available for utilities to apply for funding saw jen come on i'm not sure if jenna adam wanted to take that one um i i can attempt um it's a little difficult to predict um so from the first step the state needs to submit our application on september 30th to the u.s department of energy the federal government will then review our application and potentially negotiate an award agreement with us that process could take as little as two weeks to as much as three or four months and um after that time that the grant agreement is in place then we'll be able to start our efforts to prepare an application cycle which i anticipate will will take it a minimum of a few months before we're able to open up um an application process from there so um if i had to provide an approximate guess i'd say it most likely won't be available for a minimum of of six months to even apply and then there will also be an approval process both from odo's technical review of projects and selections but also of the federal u.s department of energy that will have to do an additional layer of review before any project is able to be authorized to get going and start making the investments out there great thanks shannon austin we'll put in the chat um the link of where you can sign up for email updates we have a check box for federal funding where we'll make sure that we'll send out the information of when applications are through that list as well as other another question i think probably for jen came in from alec about whether you could speak to the five percent administrative costs of approximately 500 000 in the first year to support yeah so um part of the requirements that will be on the oregon department of energy is negotiating the grant agreement with um with our federal partners and then once that's in place we'll have to set up a identify the awards to monitor the financials to provide the reporting both from our grantees and from the state level back to the federal government we'll also be working on our plan for future years with some of those administrative funds and technical assistance funds so not only launching what's going to hopefully hit the ground in that very first year but planning for the future with those funding um during that that first year as well great um there were a few comments in the chat that i'll just vocalize about um uh distributed renewable energy microgrid grids and the earlier conversation we had about generation as well as a comment around community engagement and applicants working with union apprenticeship programs is a critical and it looks like ryan is interested in working with folks on that thanks ryan and then uh two other questions and then i think we'll go back to the slide and pause again later um the first is from harney electric uh",

        "text": " owners is there some way where from the city's point of view or I don't know we could mitigate it here the first thing is that we will be able to work with organizations that have these types of requirements. So, for example, if working with a developer that uses this type of credits that are for low tax incentives, if someone else is doing the work of already doing it, if we work, we also with those types of land trusts we've actually seen certain cities that are trying to do this on their own and it takes a lot of staff time. So I think the first thing would be to identify someone else who can also do it or have a very specific duration as well. I think maybe it would be an exception maybe 10 years I was going to ask a question but I just want to tell you that when about I really like to see something that we can identify what is being done so we can delve a little deeper into it. To another topic that is not related, we can see what has been proposed as part of the program that we have in general at the international level. Actually, what we have seen is that the article itself indicates to us that perhaps we can be skeptical about it. From what is really happening here, what we can also see is that this would allow us to perhaps allocate 1 dollars for another type of subsidies that are made for other buildings to also become good here. How can we also provide support? Also contribute to make these types of advances. All of this sounds very good. Surely the Federal Government will also be able to do it definitively. Now what I have seen is that well, all the hope that I have also helps us to see if we have some type of sponsorship that will be may have We also know that at least it should not be a problem But we know that it also affects really We also have more affiliations where we also know that We cannot necessarily keep 10% really a year I think that the project has really been very effective here in sal We also have various projects in this area we are in favor of continuing We also support this type of actions and it should also be something Federal, imagine if a Federal Government really takes us to see specifically the details of everything that is happening I believe Which at the same time is like a topic that I put up for reflection. We are also talking about 1 billion dollars which, well, they are not what they used to be, all these things are really very expensive, I am not sure about If we want a particular action also for us to continue pursuing this type of subsidies that are given then probably We would also like to have as a recommendation that is there of course we are going to have We subsidies also here H also mentioned that it is also coordinated with the plans that we have consolidated also here we have federal programs the actions also here that we have and that perhaps could also be very appropriate to be able to have this strategy So we are also doing this coordination thank you thank you to the mayor thank you all for the excellent presentation tonight there really is no topic that I would like to eliminate Not at all On the contrary, I don't want to go too far, but I've already heard a lot about the concept of the taxes that similar cities of our size have on goods in particular that we've done and that we've seen, but really it's just another example of how feasible it is. It could be really and and really see with this warning that our staff is really going to have 1000 less employees less in this we are also going to a way to see how we can just use the easiest actions to apply here The important thing is to understand Oin is also one of our clients and so here the staff really isn't many but well we know that in general they are trying to be as adoptive as possible so in Salem maybe it is a little easier to make these is one of the things that maybe we can do if it makes sense to have some conversations with the staff with eugin also to be able to do the implementation of those ct programs I know you see he was one of the main ones and the first to do this implementation one of the lessons learned at least to do it maybe in a different way as it is being done Honestly some of my colleagues probably had that kind of conversations too Yes please Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez a couple of things too Here we also have consideration we have all kinds of incentive ideas also here of development and We definitely also know that it may be a simpler or more comfortable way to do things to be able to do it and now we also have that it is very difficult to develop in some parts where it is available also where we can see it in this way and we also have strategies very particular for certain areas that already have limited space, let's see what we do with this because many do not know if it is allowed if it is only half an acre or an acre. And if we want to look at affordability options, it is better to return to each other when When least two plots it is difficult to meet their requirements to see what other strategies We also mentioned gentrification but they are good things where it is limited by reducing parking and people with that income if you are buying it and how The state can say okay we are taking equity into consideration but if I park many of the families I work with who work hard they need this So where is that disconnect where the message is being lost because people are paying the price I don't have an answer to The latter, but we can certainly see how we can bet on development projects in terms of comparing cities that other cities are doing. I would say that they are all with more than 10,000 people. Cities with more than 100,000 people already have similar production strategies as a requirement. There are many. Similar questions are being asked throughout the valley in the region of in this region in Portland and in Oregon I wonder if there are any ideas about properties within the urban boundaries to encourage construction Because if there are some open properties available but outside of The city would not need development but for some reason it is not being developed so some program to achieve the development of certain areas I think it is thinking of ways to encourage the annexation of areas without knowing anything I would say one of the first questions would be about the infrastructure eh have the list and how many the incorporation of areas Ah yeah it's going to cost yes we are not going to have infrastructure ready if it is not within the city the city limits but what would be what comes first we would have to have a lot of yes it would not be the answer but yes it is one so what we are going to do with the state is to ask that they stop imposing so many mandates on us etc. it is good what does the commissioner think the same line this has an impact on the workforce in adjacent areas close to industrial service areas because it seems like a lot of the uh a lot of the affordable homes uh end up in the city limits but we're talking about equity and well if we have people who don't have a car or the means to buy one and if you live in a part of the city that They simply do not receive public transportation service. What do you think about it? We have not seen this yet because we have not yet carried out that study, but here the question is what we have been talking about with the state, how to work on modifying, reviewing their new programs and not just anything else. It's about transit but about other types of but it's certainly something that we can review and I think it's where you one, for example, the housing that we talk about as multifamily, medium income to ensure that you have land and disability. In the area there are different comp requirements that must be met. Maybe it is easier to go for infrastructure than perhaps there is an opportunity to give to land that has those characteristics so thinking let's see I think it is a great point because we did our staff and everyone who put a lot of effort into it did a great job ensuring that we had reification of many properties so that they were mixed use. So as a city we are going to start prioritizing middle income closer to those areas allow us to explore other areas I think which is part of the Market analysis that we are carrying out to c and what we intend to answer I still do not have an answer but we will have one questions comments commissioner ro you talked about an issue of small developers against commercial development I know it is an important issue but what have you seen locally in Oregon encourages developments by local developers, many of the alliances and associations can be made with the city, that is, the city and small developers, this capacity of personnel that manage these these and these associations with developers, I don't know if it already has it, I don't know if is it viable with your existing city staff This is an opportunity surely there would be others to provide informational resources etc. Surely there are other uh useful tools that we can review questions and comments Thank you for the presentation s I want to say thank you to the city staff everyone is here and everyone is all of this is very helpful to us I mean the city of Salem doesn't obstruct anything But we're here helping to create solutions on the other side of the coin s I mean affordable housing It 's just not affordable it's not easy to build because from the developer's perspective Salem is full very capable developers But there has to be, I mean there has to be a way to cover the expenses if you need housing but also housing across the spectrum then what I have seen in my line of work For example, Portland has always been the pillar of housing development but let's say that it is going down a few levels in terms of large- scale developers, especially in tertiary markets. In Salem, I have seen a lot of main focus on Salem. The problem is that we don't really know How to sell Salem from a development point of view to attract external",

        "text": " the heat map so to speak of the wind speeds the strongest are down here in southern oregon we saw these on the last slide the last slide had some green in it and that was from a study from a few years ago the green the green colors were wind speeds less than seven meters per spec seven meters per second and then there was updated um data that that just came out in october 2021 that reassessed wind speeds with different meteorological years and it came out with with a little higher averages so this wit this map right here reflects the most current and so the bottom line here is that bone's been involved with oregon for a few years now dlcd is leading that effort so they're in the early engagement stages and looking to identify call areas very soon potentially next month yeah i'm gonna take one pause to check into questions and um so i am just gonna pause us here um that was such a great wealth of information that jason provided about the energy landscape and floating offshore wind there's been a ton of really great questions in the chat that um people have been offering i'm just going to cover them in case you don't have access to the chat or are not tracking there so that you have the benefit of that q a there was a question whether the agency will be studying impacts on marine life we shared that oregon department of fish and wildlife and national oceanic and atmospheric administration also known as noaa fisheries have been involved in that topic on both the state and federal levels and those would be two agencies that would be a good place to start on potential impacts on marine life our study is more focused on the energy but and we don't have the expertise in-house to study fishery or marine life issues so we don't uh want to pretend like we have that expertise but our colleagues over at oregon department of fish and wildlife and noaa fisheries have been working with boem and other um through various other processes that jason had mentioned in that bubble diagram and there's some good research that they've done and analysis that they've done on those topics if there are studies or reports that speak to impacts on marine life as it relates to the potential for energy development or energy costs or markets we would really welcome those suggestions um there was also a question around how the west coast faces challenges from earthquakes and tsunamis and what the plan is to ensure infrastructure could withstand those catastrophic events we expect potential challenges related to earthquakes and tsunamis to be a focus for potential developers or utilities and those who are working on floating off for a win platform and technology itself but if you're aware of studies or reports that could be helpful in our literature review related to that we would welcome those suggestions there was also a question of what the unit of measurement for wind speed was miles per second another attendee actually answered that which we very much appreciate it's typically meters per second is what eric from virginia energy shared there was a question around uh you know given the slides jason covered had some discussion about how there's some complexity in installation and what the maintenance level might be and how much shipping traffic there might be to maintain a raise as well as whether there are any studies or information on how floating wind turbine turbine mooring lines can impact commercial fishing that is a great question it's also a space that we don't have in-house sort of expertise on but we do expect that maintenance needs would be an area focus for developers and utilities as well um and those typically are kind of represented as a potential cost for a project that is reflected in some of those market dynamics that jason was talking about uh buren bureau of ocean energy management and department of land and conservation development may have more information about shipping shipping traffic they are looking at some of those siting considerations as well as commercial fishery fishing related issues so if you have suggestions on studies reports related to that that have a focus on energy we would really welcome those suggestions in our literature there was a question about whether cables would be buried until out of the water laying on the seafloor um i think jason i'm not really sure if that's been covered in the literature but that might be based on a sort of case by case proposal by a developer is that right i think so the question was whether how the configuration or how the offshore cables would uh be deployed yeah i think the literature at least what i've read from you has shared that there could be you know different configurations based on what a developer proposes um in a potential leasing opportunity and so i don't think we have the answer to that question tim but the literature does i think show that there are some different um configurations so i think the answer is we're not sure but we welcome any studies that we might have missed that have some sort of energy related specific uh implications on on cable burning or laying on the sea floor let's see there's another question of how will existing various undersea cables existing in territorial sea and federal waters affect planning and siting my understanding is that fishermen and industry alike don't like to cross these lines so may be may narrow opportunities for sighting and landing as well i think that's a great point charlie and i think that might be something that comes up in the boam and dlcd process and thinking about citing considerations through a potential leasing that odo is also following as well and we have a section in our study about citing and permitting that kind of narrow some of those topics to think about how that might relate to the energy implications in the market so stay tuned on that uh our transmission lines used for hydro and fossil fuel generated power compatible with wind energy generated power is there more management involved due to inconsistent wind patterns great question mike it's a topic of conversation within the oregon department of energy quite a bit um jason do you want to share anything on on transmission lines i know that you authored a um an article in our last biennial energy report about transmission anything you want to add yeah for that for that question the answer is uh yes i think um in the affirmative in that the transmission lines are capable of sending any electricity from any type of technology the kind of management piece in terms of inconsistent wind patterns as compared to sort of like a fuel that can be turned on and off is a issue that many in the energy sector are are um are dealing with and thinking about and we've had a number of renewable energy projects both solar wind on land that have that same um kind of consideration for utilities and those that are responsible for balancing the grid um and so i think that there would be sort of a similar application of the lessons learned and management strategies that would be applied offshore so um the question around transmission lines and how that is managed is an area that has a lot of people working on and i think that there would be some similar management you know um strategies involved with the offshore wind piece for wind patterns mike if you're aware of any kind of studies or reports that we should be looking at in that topic for offshore uh we would welcome those suggestions in our um in the comments in the literature let's see here uh definitely suggest need for assessment of potential impacts on marine mammals and seabirds thank you michelle will odo study attempt to capture the varying economics of placing turbines in different wind speed areas the focus of our robert thanks for that question the real focus of this bill and this implementation is to conduct a literature review and collect the perspectives of our stakeholders and the public in the potential for three gigawatts uh being planned for um development offshore but it's not an actual citing question or where we might be able to anticipate varying economics we don't expect to have sort of um our own technical analysis occurring it's more about reviewing the literature sharing it and giving an opportunity to get those quantity qualitative perspectives in from stakeholders on those questions as well so i don't the study to capture that type of let's see here is high intensity when red on the map always better for wind energy development i recall there was a land-based proposal on oregon's south coast in the past and it was discussed that wind intensity could be problematic for maintenance has new technology rectified that concern jason i think that might be a question on that slide that you had that had the color um kind of color coordination on each coast and the great little wind blowing in the top left corner um i think that might be from that that uh that map i think in general the higher wind intensity is uh meaning that it's a it's a sort of greater um potential for uh the resource to produce more energy so it's more for that reason i'm not sure about the maintenance piece there i'm not familiar with that or whether new technology has rectified that concern but if you have some links or sort of report your studies on that topic and we would really welcome those suggestions in the portal there's a study suggestion on cumulative impacts to existing ocean users there have been many report recent past 10 years pressures closure areas management restrictions to existing uses and all this creates a cumulative impact that was from k jacobson thank you so much for that idea that's exactly the type of you know comment that we would appreciate through the comment portal uh there's probably some study needed related to cables and impact on crab given results of similar studies on brown crab off scotland thank you tim all right i think that i've managed to get through oh here's one more the recent legislation directed agencies to study offshore wind up to three gigawatts virtually every area where initial offshore wind proved viable has experienced a rapid follow-on expansion following initial feasibility determination given that offshore wind is scalable will any consideration be given to expansion of offshore wind beyond the current study level thanks for that question mike we're really focused on the three gigawatts um part of the direction in the bill the bill does talk about sort of ideas for further research or analysis and that might be something to consider in the comments if that's something that you would be interested in all right i think i'm going to close sort of q a here and i'll just reiterate um one of the kind of scope scoping questions in the in the chat has come up a few times and just want to reiterate that um our study

        "text": " be better suited to go through OEM great I've already called them before this uh perfect yeah they would be they're they're a good partner for answering those types of questions um but this is State funding and we'd be happy to um you know Hannah um would be happy to communicate with OEM to make sure that um they understand this grant um in a in a you know in a different way um you don't have to do that explaining that's great because I know that you know the state is prioritizing natural Hazard M or Hazard mitigation plans for the use of brick funds so yeah uh that would be wonderful thank you yeah and just as a a note um in addition the University of Oregon is also a great resource um for some of that work and they are also on our list of technical assistance providers which you can find on our website so um just as a note um for that resource for everyone else Hannah Max do you have anything else to add to that um yeah I would love Max's opinion on using these funds as as match um and just this the perspective if we have it now um you know I'm inclined to say I think they should be able to be used however if I need to do some more research to confirm that I will yeah I think the answer is we don't know at this time it's a good question uh we'll look into that and um and let you know Justin we I I love the idea like I love the concept and where you're going with sort of a broader perspective energy is is one of the community right Community lifelines ESF like so I'm esf2 emergency support function 12 for fuels uh in the state and so we understand that structure and how to respond the program still has its own requirements and so my thought is maybe it can be used for matching funds but you'd still have to meet the obligations of the grant program specifically I mean maybe that sounds obvious but just to kind of reiterate that um but I think it's a good thought and we will track it down might need to go talk to our lawyer uh and see what they have to say about it thanks Max yeah I'll work on that Jus I'll get back to you um Justin if you don't mind dropping your um your email in the chat too that would be helpful in getting back to you um or uh maybe Hannah can drop her email in the chat and you can email her um either way um we'll definitely get back to you thanks Justin um I just want to make it pretty pretty clear that we have um a little over 10 minutes left um and also that Hannah is um 100% of her time is spent working with these so for more of the specific questions um I I would love to um set up those um those um meetings maybe outside of this and have more broad questions for the group um John I see your hand up and then we have a um question from Molly in the chat as well about um uh EJ community so I'll hand it over to you John if you want to come off mute yeah just a quick question you know there's over 800,000 people live in Moma County um and you know we have lots of different kind of cult culturally specific communities um and someone wondering around the energy resilience like I just don't like what what's the planning expectation there like there's is it that some percentage of the population has access to emergency power I mean we can't even we don't even have our Mass Sheltering figured out for you know postc Cascadia I mean I I would say that I think the goal is to set up a plan that identifies where those potential resilience centers would be what the alternate energy um generation or storage resources would be that you would need to make them functional um to set you one step closer towards being able to access implementation to make some of those plans into reality um you know there are limitations it's um we're not you know we we want you to um we recognize there are practical constraints right so I think we encourage towards the most functional outcome possible for your community and you know it might be that you're like we're going to outline some more details on these P like top priority ones and then we're going to have a list next steps or next locations that we would do that with that's what I'm inclined to say Max I'll I'll turn it over to you yeah um this cat on my lap of course work from home um I totally understand John and and you can imagine how you know a program that provides you know sort of a broad scope for the entire County I'm sorry the entire state may not be able to provide every you know the ability to provide the information and funding necessary for the bigger populace counties bigger Geographic territories I can Envision I can Envision A system that you know if you haven't identified the local community hubs uh as called for in statute that maybe an alternative is some type of a broader scope of you know I'm picturing like a map that has bubbles like we need to have a community resilience Hub in this location East of 205 in this community and needs to have these criteria but it's not yet done and so maybe it's like a planning step in your process I think what you'll find is when you sort of get into the statute and read 3630 and it's it's basically one page of Statute um know there's a lot of information in that one page um but I think you'll be able to sort of see what it requires and then think about sort of the broad options for how that can be applied to your county and sort of to meet both the requirements of the of the Grant and the and the statute but also be practical and sort of understanding that this might be a stepping stone towards um future efforts with other funding sources agreed um something that I want to make sure that I get in here before time is up that Justin um thank you for this comment in the chat you you did note uh in relation to Tiffany's question that communication services are critical public in critical Public Services facilities and that just makes it clear to me that is named um they are named in statute as part of the critical Public Services facilities as you pointed out um and I'll make sure for our next round of webinars to put up that definition to avoid you know increase Clarity and avoid confusion so thank you for for throwing that bone in the chat I appreciate it perfect okay um Tiffany is has her hand raised I apologize I didn't see it earlier but we're GNA go Tiffany and then there's a question from Molly and Debbie um Molly from Clackamus and Debbie from cous County um so Tiffany if you want to come off of um mute um feel free thanks so much I have two questions uh the first is related to uh something I uh experienced in supporting the fuel action plan about 10 years ago and during that process Deanna Henry provided All Counties with data regarding locations of all liquid fuel sources I'm wondering if that's updated and still available I'm in a new County now I could really use that to get my head around the the environment um but also for um for the other um energy types that you talked about and then my second question relates to scope of the project and involvement of municipalities so yes we have infrastructure located got that but when it comes to mapping essential and public service buildings 3630 is silent on this um what do you have to say about in incorporate so County yes but cities also what's the expectation thank you Hannah I can feel the first question um Dianna works on our team and if you haven't heard di is retiring at the end of the month by the way uh so well we're all sad about that um future questions on that program send them to me and we can help out uh we do have updated information around fueling infrastructure um we are pulling it together as part of our energy security plan and we if you want that information some of it has um I have to check on sort of how to share it the right way uh we'll be in how about if you want the information maybe you can talk to to Hannah or me directly and we can provide it um specifically I'm trying to think of the best way to share that information it's not published on our website yet because it's not done done um but it's sort of in process right now with a contractor that um we've hired to put it together so it's it's almost available and should be available by July um is what I'm thinking August at the latest uh to the second question about counties and cities Hannah what do you think about how that works yeah yeah we thought about this recognizing that some count more populous counties uh often have some populous cities that are not in for example natural Hazard mitigation plans um I think our interpretation is that the plan should cover those cities I mean they're they're pretty important right for the county um you know we can't mandate that cities collaborate though we are hopeful and um looking at some other County plans not natural Hazard mitigation plans that do cover cities with the note of we don't have jurisdiction here we can't require that this happens but we can support collaboration and support efforts and so I think that is the approach to take with these plans um hoping that cities are collaborative and helpful um in this planning process but I think you know the plan should cover municipalities in in your community as well um thank you uh okay we have five minutes and three questions so speed round um again I have put hand 's email and Max's email in the chat um Hannah is 100% on this program and can continue to answer questions and love to set up um meetings um to talk out questions um if there are them that are specific to your community Molly from clamus county says what is the community engagement requirement for this planning process mentioning environmental justice communities what are the expectations around this engagement yeah that's a great question so um the statute says that counties must consult with environmental justice communities to identify communities within the county that experience social vulnerability so that is the um direction from the statute however um you know we encourage more significant collaboration with environmental justice communities with your community more broadly as is possible um around um engaging with this plan thinking through the IDE what are Community needs um but in terms of specifically the expectations I think the expectation is that you reach out to environmental justice communities in your county um see if you can connect with them",

        "text": " Veeth, and added that cost into his financing package. If we advance forward on nine seven, we applied for a permit. Utility signed off on 913. The customer closed on their construction loan on 920. And then we received our building permit on 928 and we started site work on ten two. So we're moving along quite quickly. Had a scheduled rough inspection for ten, let me see, for 1021. And then utilities placed a hold on our permit on 1020, stating that the grant funds had expired and it was necessary to pay a line extension for 365ft of $37,000. My point in coming to you today is that just puts an undue burden onto an individual. And I'd ask to see if the county would somehow either grant a waiver for Mister Veeth to get a well. This line extension would not serve either neighbor because there's wells in those locations already. There's no way that he could get any of that money back because it would extend to his far end of his property, and there's already a house on that location, so this burden would be totally out of his pocket. So if the county would be so kind to either help with that extension fee, lower that extension fee, or grant a waiver that Mister Vith could put a well in, that we can continue with the project. And since you closed, since he closed on his construction loan, he's already paying interest at this point. We stopped construction yesterday. The utilities department released our hold, so we are able to get our plumbing inspection, but we're not sure Mister Veeth can't afford the $37,000 to add that line. And I can give you the parcel number and the address if that helps you. The House address is 10943 Southwest 39th Court. That is in Ocala Waterway and the PID is 3507, 800-6017, you know, normally these go through the DRC and then they come to the commission. This is a little bit, I apologize, and I probably jumped the gun, but I was trying to keep the job running, so I apologize for not doing that and be happy. Jody, is jody here? Jody Kirk, do you want to come up and give us some guidance on this one? If we go back through DRC, what's the timing? And this is the short line extension program, is that what we. Yes, sir. Jody Kirkman, utilities director. This was actually ran through the short waterline extension program. When the application was submitted, of course, everybody had been warned or at least informed that the project, the funding was actually starting to be depleted. So they were kind of running at a little bit of a risk when they basically did go to get their permit. In this case, the money basically had been exhausted. So that's kind of where we're at in the whole situation, at least to this one particular item. To answer your question, in my opinion, it'd be better that we run this through DRC. At least let the DRC committee evaluate it, make a decision on it, and then if it goes to the next level, bring it here, following the rules outlined accordingly. What's the timeframe to do that? Since this fellow's paying interest on his loan, I would assume with support from staff that we could get it on for Monday's DRC meeting and at least start that process, and then it would come back to us on November 21. I again would have to work with staff to make sure that we can probably make that happen. Mister chair. So just one last question. So the thing that concerns me in this is that it appears that, that they relied on the county. And is that fund completely depleted at this point? It is. Basically we had set aside the full $5 million and basically that was utilized in the first year. Commissioner, Byte refresh my memory. Did we run that? We haven't run that line yet, though. We have. Not this one in particular. No, ma'am. Okay. And it would serve no one else for us to run that. It would actually, there's existing home, it's a cul de sac. It's a short cul de sac, about 340ft. What I recollect there are two vacant lots. So it'd be two, it'd be this as the running, the catalyst, if you will, and one benefiting the other. Folks do have wells. If those wells ever went bad or if they wanted to connect, of course they would have the potential. I believe there was ten overall lots on that cul de sac. And Mister chair, based on the information that's been presented to us today, if the board agrees, I see no problem with moving ahead, letting this go through the DRC process for approval. And if this board approves it, I believe we could go ahead and move things along and let them ratify this on our next, at our next board meeting so that we don't keep this project from moving forward. Yeah, I agree. I think they took the holds off. So it's, it's, it's not. They are, it's going to move through permitting and building and everything else. It just needs to figure out whether they're putting in a line or putting in a well, right? Yes, sir. I mean, so I don't think it stops construction at all. No. Once they took the hold off, no. But they want to kind of know what they're getting into. And the homeowners stating that they can't afford the $37,000, this commissioner would be fine with granting them a waiver, and ultimately it's going to come back to the commission. There's a gentleman raising his hand. Do you have an interest in this particular project? It's his afternoon. I'm Robert Veeth. And hearing what you guys were saying, I really appreciate you all, you know, listening to us on this, and I absolutely cannot afford this $37,000. I had no idea this was going to come at me and talking about moving forward with the project and not knowing what's going on with the water. This is a huge, huge problem for me, because if it comes down to it, I may just stop what I'm doing now, because I just do not have the funds to pay that $37,000. So I'm kind of at your mercy on this. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, commissioner. No, I completely understand, although Mister V. I absolutely sympathize with you. But when you get, when they are pulling permits, people know that the funds are going to run out at a certain point, and everybody is warned by the paper and documentation that you received, hopefully, about that. As far as I understand, I saw the, I saw the piece of paper at one point and it told everybody, hey, be aware, this could be a part of, you know, this could need to be included in your building projects in the future. We only have so much money, and once that $5 million runs out, it is going to be on the buyer. Beware onus of doing, you know, so I just. And also, we can't just do this today. Brought up as kind of a walk on. It does have to go through the proper land development code process. If I could address that, because we actually. Unless you got something that says we were going to fund it, Mister Plunkett, I mean, I'll waive it today for you. I wish I did. I had a magic piece of paper that'd be great, but I don't. And I understand that. I personally, I knew the funds were eventually going to run out, but I would. I am surprised that the county would sign off on utilities knowing that so much. So much of the funds have already been exhausted and so many permits were already in the pipeline. And I'm sure I'm not the only guy that has other permits. I mean, we don't do this many water line extensions. I know, like they do in Mary Noakes, but I'm sure there's plenty of guys down there that are going to get a big wake up call coming forward where they've already processed their permit. We've actually gotten our permit, had our first inspection and then put the hold on, I think. Great for us. We wanted to keep things first. Settle what where Rob's at because the lot's been cleared, the dirt work's been done, the form boards are in, the plumbing's in the ground, and we want to give him some peace of mind. Do we have an alternative? Rather than he's already had that expense, plus he's already closed on his loan and had expenses there as well. Mister chair, I understand where your commissioner Brian is. What was that? Pid again, please? 3578, go ahead, dash. 006017. Sorry, my battery to the right. So I'm going to borrow Commissioner Stones here. What sounds like where we're headed is going back to DRc November 21, try and get it agenda that will give us an opportunity to get with staff. This is just kind of hitting us square in the face. So give us a couple of weeks to kind of sort through it. Yeah, I think we can work through this right here. I mean, we do stuff all the time. We just did a walk on item to approve a million dollars to change appropriations, so I don't understand why we can't use a little common sense here and take care of this Jody, while she's looking that up, how many other potential parcels are we looking at that could be in the same. So, commissioner, you want a whole pile of people coming up here every time they have? They don't like the short line. Hold on. I'm",

might think uh assuming you know I'm not sure what process you may have or maybe that's the question I have is let's say one of your subs is is um not paying somebody for job done and you've paid them and what process would that person have is there a way that they can go up the ladder where like you're the final back stop what's the process in that person or is it does it stop at that leadership of that subcontractor like what what could someone do in that situation what would you recommend that they do because the last thing we want is these projects that are happening in downtown which are very important um to be stained you know and um have hurt have that hurt certain members of the communities sure I I I well first of all I want to say I have in the project we did with for you in Salem I I haven't heard anything about that now they bring up a project in um Portland I'd be happy to talk talk with you about it uh they can lean the project for unpaid wages so that's what I would suggest that they do councelor gwy I'm I'm just wondering if there be I I don't know if there could be a misunderstanding so um are how many of the workers on these projects are your employees and how many are employees of a subcontractor so I'm and would you be willing to look at the video that this gentleman talked about and at least find out if that is a deacon employee or is it an employee of a subcontractor well none of the none of the employees on the project are employees we hire dokey construction they're the general contractor they hire the subcontractors uh we're we're the we're the the developer of the project um so we we don't have any construction employees I asked because you said that your your employees so you mentioned your carpenters and so that's why I asked well I they were referring to a project in uh Portland which I they didn't name the project so I don't know what project it is but I'm assuming there was a deacon construction project uh this is Deacon development that you're talking to here and uh we don't hire any construction workers and in this particular case in Salem we didn't even hire our sister company Deacon construction we hired Dy because they have such a long track record uh in the in the city and with the subcontractors so yeah we don't have any uh construction workers on the pro Pro councelor Stapleton thank you um yeah I want to pull us up and out of um kind of an Us Versus Them conversation and I want to talk about the industry as a whole um because uh sometimes we can uh get into the weeds and then get defensive and not really get at the heart of the issue and the Heart of the issue that I understand it and this is new to me um I am just now starting to learn about what's happening across the state um in this industry as a whole and so what I am concerned about is that it seems that the industry as a whole has an issue uh with unfair labor and even human rights violations I would say and it isn't in a space right now that it is monitored or regulated by the and so we're in a space well I'll just speak for myself I am in a space now that I am being asked to vote on something that I am learning more about that gives me pause um because of the indust the issues within the and so a couple of questions and I think councelor Gonzalez got at this a little but if we are you know these nine folks here are going to vote we're going to put our name on this um and we're going to say yes we want to do this what kind of guarantees can you give us that these types of behaviors or concerns will be addressed in a way that is accountable uh to you uh to the general contractor um and that that information gets back to this body that is really putting our stamp of approval on on a project with you we are partnering with you to see this through and some of it is making me personally uncomfortable so what kind of guarantee can you give me um that you understand the issue at its heart and that you are doing everything possible to make sure that it's not happening on projects that you are involved with well this is the first I've heard of it so it's really not fair to ask me what I'm going to do with it because I don't even know what you say it's a pervasive issue I think you're listening to one side of the story I really do and I think it would be better to have uh an open discussion and not when we you know not in quarters like this but where we can sit down and talk about the situation because I I don't think you're getting the I I I'm being given the impression that every construction project has all these unpaid workers that don't get paid for 6 weeks and are paid $8 an hour or whatever and I don't believe that's anywhere close to being accurate so I think we need to identify and Define what it is that we're concerned about first and then talk about if a remedy is is necessary uh these workers can lean the project if they if they feel like they've been um unjustly or not paid um this is the I can tell you this is the first time in 20 years that anyone's asked us to okay how are you going to prove that the people uh that work for the subcontractors that work for the general contractor are being paid area wages area standard um I think it's really important that everybody gets paid what they're do and there's you don't need more state laws in order to um enforce it now maybe they need uh the workers need some awareness of what laws are available to them but that doesn't mean that there isn't a mechanism for them to bring it light thank you um I think I might have some more questions but I'll let that one simmer for just a minute thank you I'm wondering uh Miss rord if we might if I'm trying to look for a way to resolve this or at least bring have a a more robust conversation other than during public comment CU I don't think that's the place to do it and I'm wondering if maybe we could discuss you convening a meeting or something a followup so we could talk about these issues more broadly and if there are specific questions uh for this particular developer if it's just in general with the industry or I I I'm just trying to figure out a way a path forward to uh get more information and to get some of our questions answered and to let Mr Deacon you know actually be prepare for some of these these questions and that sort of thing so I'm just trying to figure out like how do we do you have any advice well I'm absolutely happy to convene a meeting to bring parties together with council members to discuss these issues secondarily to that there is the item that's on the agenda tonight so then that leads to some procedural issues in how we address that um I think there were also some other issues tied to time less of the project and depending on what may or may not happen this evening that we're of concern to the development team as well so um all of that said we can move forward with the path of convening a discussion but then there will continue to be conversation this evening around the agenda item unless there's a motion to do something else right and I guess we I guess some of these answers won't be known right in this moment but later after we get to that portion of the agenda but I think regardless of what happens with that agenda item that this is an important conversation I guess that's my way of my way of looking at it sounds like there's enough interest I'm seeing nods from councelor Gonzales and and a couple of others so sounds like whatever we do with that we would want to have a bigger conversation very happy to facilitate that conversation thank you I I I want to say one more thing if I can um you're being asked to do is to um invoke uh Union prevailing wage wages on in your projects in order to have the uh the tax exemption um I can guarantee it would stop this project it would be it would be done I I heard the question a little bit more with some more complexity than just that one thing and that's why I want to have an actual conversation where we can I can really understand what the folks were saying and understand the implications and understand what you're saying I I don't feel like I can do that right in this moment I understand but it it seems like a rather complex set of issues I didn't hear it just as one thing but I want to understand it better um so that's that's just my take councelor Phillips uh thank you mayor and uh thank you for being here um to talk about the project uh that we're considering tonight um I mean this caught me off guard too I wasn't expecting to have this conversation now so I I can commiserate with the fact that you know this is challenging to get brand new information and Concepts at the last minute um I don't know why it's happening tonight tonight I would like to learn more about that as a counselor um and that's not something you can answer but I think there's a couple of questions I should ask you or may need to ask you as opposed to staff although I'm not sure uh first is you know how big of a deal is timeliness like do you need a vote tonight or does that risk the project I I heard your other comment on uh prevailing wages and that's not my question separate from that you know is a vote absolutely needed tonight I think we meet the second Monday of May would be the next time we meet as a body um and then the other question I have uh is um so I don't want to give the impression to the community that this is completely unregulated like we're this is obviously a very regimented thing from our perspective as counselors and as has been said by my colleagues you know uh this is a partnership uh that we've done before and what we as a city are getting is affordable housing it's roughly 15% or 16 of the 105 residential units and that's not a",

        "text": " low medium high or just that dollar amount which I heard um being a point of conversation amongst the group as well impact on local econ economy the environment then legal viability and then the impact timeline so this was something that we didn't ask you all but uh in for the focus groups we were interested in how important it was for them to know that something could be realized in the short term in the midterm or in the long term so really um understanding the full portfolio when it comes together what could be enacted now and you could expect to get near-term results what is worth putting energy into to achieve kind of that longer realization Horizon and then the last one um people were not actually very interested in whether or not things worked in other cities so there you go and we'll put this up again and I think it's in the right order um against the results that you all provided via the survey it is confirmed it is so then this was our investing question and so we asked folks to um play our investing game had 600 Monopoly dollars um to invest in the six Ci's strategic goals um so we gave people a little bit of time and again this was oriented towards understanding um where people's values lied in lay in terms of how Services of the city showed up in the community what did that look like and so the number one um area that most people invested in was a safe community and so again thinking back to of those takeaways what a safe Community meant was different and was nuanced for a lot of people it was everything from well-lit Parks well-maintained streets um to a presence of police and fire um quick response um of emergency services and emergency preparedness those kinds of things uh and then kind of the second highest area was a safe reliable and efficient infrastructure so that was another really interesting one so thinking about the uh how the city's facilities are maintained so really big orientation towards uh making sure that infrastructure keeps Pace with growth uh and then the third one was having a welcoming and livable Community there was a lot of conversation about how all of these really intertwined and intersected with each other so lots of conversation around can you have a welcoming Community if you don't have a safe one um and what does that look like for different people there were a lot of different perspectives um on what that meant for folks so we always like to play this um investing game just to see where people's kind of priorities lie and then their understanding of what this looks like when it comes to the city strategic goals and how it shows up them so any questions um next up we're going to get into the decision-making framework but any kind of questions about some of the focus group yeah Matt ha H how strong was what you alluded to earlier about the particip ANS wanting to make sure that any revenue generated went to specific items or was or they could track how that money was spent how it was used and things like that I'd say it was um about 5050 it really showed up kind of more towards the end of the conversation there was a trend um in some of the feedback that we got where there was just a desire to know um a lot of folks felt like well uh I pay my taxes and then go into this general fund but then what do this general fund do it seems like it covers a lot of things it seems like I might not necessarily know how it changes or how it flows and just would love to learn more and have it be more easily accessible about how that's portioned out and then really um when we ask the question about what might make you more or less likely to pursue a different Revenue generating option understanding what that money would be used for was a high priority for I would say the majority of folks yeah good yeah Sean Sean ncas would you say from these results that people were more likely to be open to any type of tax not just a levy but any type of tax that had specific funding goals attached to it yeah thank you we didn't get into I didn't ask the specifics again because we didn't expect people to know the difference between a levy and a tax kind of based on how they were showing up but there was an overall interest that folks would be more likely to support in either of those options if it was associated with something that they could say ah I see how this then shows up in my community yeah so Keith Norris related to that right that last poll you showed of of kind of the city's uh goal areas how much explanation were they given about what each one of those things meant right so in terms of you said it was interesting to kind of see what their understanding was of these and how they believe this stuff shows up well how how did they believe that right I mean like where where does that get into because I could make each one of those things basically say the same thing uh in terms of its delivery right and so what's the what is the vision there in terms of of that was there data collected on that not that I expect you to outlay all that for us right now but like do we have that information in terms of those Services they wanted to show up uh in funding these particular areas we didn't dive into the specific Sur and how they showed up in each one of the areas but what we did do is we provided them not just kind of the the two or three words um that you see on the screen it was an overview to say when we think about a safe community that mainly refers to Public Safety police fire emergency preparedness and response yeah so there was a little bit more than just two words that we did folks great questions all right so next up on the agenda um we're going to chat with you all about that decision-making framework so thinking of and through all of the 41 options plus the five additional ones that were chatted through um during the last session we want to make sure that um and talk with you all about putting together and agreeing to a criteria that can help shape how you evaluate assess talk about prioritize the r different Revenue generating options um into the future as we kind of shift from this information gathering stage now into getting a little bit more input from the community coalescing around different uh Revenue generating options we did our first past later today we're going to talk about like Colleen said potentially kind of um scraping out of the bottom saying great these ones we can kind of remove from further consideration these are the ones that we really want to think about and prioritize evaluating moving forward when it comes to things like how um the level of importance or whether something is worth pursuing through analysis in the whole way this uh decision-making framework and criteria is going to be really helpful to put numbers to some of the opinions that folks have about the level of importance for those different areas yes Becky Becky ban uh I found when I was going through these there's only one of these options that I definitely said yes I'd take money from the state for for their buildings in Le of property tax most of the rest of them were Mayes because so much depends on how it's implemented if you implement the the wage tax all the way down to minimum wage I got issues but if you made it a place higher up are we going to be able to make those boundary condition string contingencies Avail stick to the options yeah so we're going to go through all the ones that had the lowest interest and talk about those exact things and then agree to as a group does it make sense could we say yeah it doesn't feel like this is worth pursuing or diving into that level of analysis for these ones because it's just a non-starter all right so we asked you to rate your the level of importance that you associated with each of the different criteria so um the most important for folks 70% of you said it was highly important to uh evaluate different options based on their ability to generate ongoing Revenue over onetime uh Revenue next up is uh currently legally viable so that was also very important for folks congratulations um you get to stay on the task force um the next one was Equitable um this one really kind of fell between highly and moderately important um looking again at the difference between regressive versus structures uh and then in the following is where we start to see some not so importance pop up so have widespread negative impacts on the local economy um that one kind of started to shift it's moderately important mostly with a little bit of high importance um and then negative impacts on the environment uh it was very interesting that one kind of got a little bit of all three and then kind of moderately important requiring that administrative effort so again kind of thinking to that implementation and the return on investment if it costs us more to implement it then we are going to gain in Revenue is it worth it uh and then the last one again very low interest 20% not important at all is if it's been proven to work elsewhere in Oregon so we did math um for each one of these we ranked um we assigned numbers into each of the levels of importance so highly important was given a three moderately important given a two not important given a one we added them up and divided them to get the weighted scores which are um which gave us kind of that priority ranking in terms of criteria so again sustainable legal Equitable um not negative impacts on the local economy uh not negative impacts on the environment um administrative effort and then proven torque elsewhere in uh in Oregon or how you all ranked the different criteria options so putting them up against um kind of what we learned from the focus groups uh so folks kind of resoundingly there's a lot of agree um agreement between these two groups on this sustainability so a very high level of importance placed on whether or not different options can create ongoing Revenue sources versus onetime onetime options or things that may need to be renewed um or go up for a vote kind of periodically um then there was a little bit of a difference so Equity came in second for focus groups and came in third for this group um and then we didn't ask this group cuz it was a little bit of a gimme but we did ask the focus groups about um how important the estimated Revenue potential was for each one of these so that was very interesting that that ended up third uh and",

        "text": " to um essentially uh issue The Joint statement um you know Chris has talked about that so we can sort of conclude this revision um today and then with some followup on on stas part with with director Benner um you can say this is still a little bit um unclear we can put this on the agenda for the next council meeting and and not have more details and not have a representative from PGE but have staff take a little bit more time to kind of frame this up so so it's more clear and better understanding for you and and we would be happy to do that or as I said that third is set that meeting up um with a PG representative so that you are given whatever information is allowable to give to you so really I see three options um and hopefully those are clear and thank you council member con Condon again um I I think that option to move to March and for me it's just the lack of the draft of seeing the draft sure there's going to be a letter written on our behalf I guess I'd prefer to see a draft and all of us nod our head and say yeah it's it works can I just speak real quick just to to answer one of these questions here that I probably didn't so acting on your behalf to revie I reviewed the security plan to to ensure that it was adequate for the safeguards that were needed for the ISC and also included a site visit with physically walking around so acting on your behalf I'm comfortable that they have met those requirements based on my experience in training Cindy coning again and yet I mean I I certainly um understood that and so that's why it is that letter that draft um that we're saying yet that speaks for so council member buer I would just like the draft to say exactly what you just said that you were acting on our behalf that you have this expertise that we delegated this visit to you back in last year and um also with some summary of what Chris provided on the nature of the amendment because I think that set some context for us um but that finding that you've made that this meets health and safety requirements because that's the finding we need to make so if we can see a draft of the statement um by March but really just to lay out those key factors would be perfect and I will add also that PG advised me yesterday that rev 10 is coming so rev 10 they expect to have out by the summer okay well we'll see you again yes Mr secretary U thank you madam chair for the record Todd cornette so what I'm hearing is sort of one of the I don't know I don't know if it was exactly one of the options that I provided but um one that is certainly doable which is to my recommendation would be then to not take action today um that we would set this as an agenda item in the March meeting we would have the draft statement um that was previously discussed um that'll give us time to not only give it to you in advance but to give it to to director Benner in advance make sure she's okay with it as well and then to whatever extent whatever information that we can um provide to you you know in terms of framing you know the issue the the site uh visit the evaluation of the security plan we will put that in another staff report that hopefully provides some more clarity again we're going to be limited um but we'd be happy to do that so this is Marcy and I don't want to speak for anyone but for me I don't even want staff to go through a bunch of Hoops and make another staff report what I think that is I think we all clearly understood what we have asked you to do so I don't think burning manh hours that way it's I think a letter and then I'm gonna look over at Patrick because he's here to help us if he sees the letter too then I think we've we've covered our BAS I think we've all worked really hard to make sure that if somebody goes back and look they'll be able to say oh yeah they didn't just whatever that there's something than there in context so if you all are agreement I don't think that Sarah and the team need to be scrambling around doing extra work we just want a draft letter in the context that Mr ree just said Christopher is all on board and Patrick's like yep that makes sense not that you can't do that but he's oh yeah no I I'm happy to defer those things he is everybody fine with that council member delin and council member chud that work for you yes yes you all right well we're going with that so good for all right thank you for your time thank you for joining us we appreciate you you were in my neighborhood I live in rineer so uh I could have said hey good to see you thank you all right um we are looking at let's take 15 minutes uh to get up we uh need to get some lunch and then we're going going to have a working lunch I guess is that what we're doing everyone's saying yes so the time is now 1208 if we could be back let's say 12:25 we'll get an extra couple minutes out of the deal 12:25 please okay we are ready to resume from Recess the time is 12:28 and we have the financial Assurance review forms sist tions this is an action item and we have sicy Fleming financial analyst excuse me Fiscal analyst uh to present to us good afternoon it is now afternoon Perfect all right good afternoon chair GRS member of the council for the record I'm sic Fleming the fiscal analyst for the sighting Division and I'm before you to recommend that Council add mizuo bank and deut Bank to the council's list of financial institutions pre-approved to act as issuers of bonds and letters of credit as you're aware the council rules require site certificate holders to obtain a financial Assurance um instrument to meet the retirement and financial Assurance standard from a financial institution approved by the council Council evaluates its financial institutions and forms annually and the last annual update occurred in November of 202 three um Portland General Electric the site certificate holder for multiple fsec projects is requested Council evaluation of mizuo Bank um for the pre-approved list for their use in potentially obtaining a letter of credit for their cardi Port Westward or big Lo projects we have reviewed the qualifications of mizuo and they're displayed here on the slide for the major credit rating agencies and have concluded that mizuho uh demonstrates sufficient Financial strength to act as issuers for the state of Oregon next slide please n in addition uh yellow rose bush Energy Center LLC the applicant for the yellow rose bush energy project has requested Council evaluation or Council consideration of deut bank to be added to the list as well and we have evaluated them and found that they too demonstrate sufficient Financial strength to act as issuers for coverage required by the state no you're and so those are the two entities that requested and then next slide and then as uh Mr kette mentioned during his Council secretary report the request that we have previously received from Herston power project to add language to the letter of credit template has been removed so Council consideration of that item is no longer needed um and then that is that's it so I will turn it over to you um your options are going to be displayed on the slide and I appreciate your time well thank you very much council do we have any comments questions um Cindy CL for the record um just a question because mizumo Bank was um their um report was at of March 31st I'm just wondering because it's you know it's been almost a year is there any going back in like okay what will there March 2024 right yeah there to I actually did look at that so their next report is scheduled to come out at the end of March and I just put it on my calendar to just go ahead and take a look just to make sure that everything still seemed you know consistent with the ratings and the the Outlook that we're receiving now yeah and and just if there were a a difference would would you come back in absolutely yes I can't remember when the banking issues came up but it

        "text": " was previously at the county um there as Peter said there um are zon to Zone setbacks and Landscaping buffers things like that also building and Fire safety so any building perits would have to go through to help make sure that these are um developed again the contamination of the soils um this involves at least 15 ft of excavation assuming that the soil stayed on site they don't necessarily recognize property line so this very well could have meandered onto the neighborhood properties there are a few errors so it's not in in this this issue better terms the property the previous property owner air in not alerting the city of the deed restrictions and the city air in changing the zone to a deed restrictive designation these are public record and it would it would maybe be um it um it would have been nice for the the city to say okay we're changing from an industrial property to a residential property let's see if there's anything that would cause problems city council has recognized that there is there is an error by reducing the application application fee by 50% uh we believe that there's no fault to the current property owner and they're just trying to fix this problem so that they're not in violation of DEQ and they can utilize their industrial property as they purchased it our city comprehensive plan in the economic development and employment section specifically talks about um the growth and stability of uh existing small businesses and how they should be facilitated uh and expanded upon and that we should you know um the allowances for those types of businesses US Supreme Court has extended the principle beyond the fiscal seizure of property are taking and states that the general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent if regulation go too far it would be recognized as a taking and we believe that restricting 63% of the property uses is a taking it is too far the state looks at these two items highlighted in pink that show um you know reasoning behind it that the land owners been denied all economically viable uses and that the Reg imposes burdens or costs on the land owner that do not bear a reasonable relationship to the impacts of the community in summary we believe that as presented without the additional conditions the city should approve the zone change comprehensive plan Amendment um and any questions questions um you said that the property is currently being used how is it being used there's currently uh vehicle storage warehousing um there is I believe there are offices uh there is an office inside they're not utilizing the outdoor storage but they are using structures on the so as the change outlined in the staff recommendation would the current uses of the property be fall within that of the what the staff is recommending for in this condition one with the current use meet condition one sound sounds said vles would probably be the vehicle services and storage which dided okay thank you any other questions I guess I'm just curious of the 63% that you say um in uses that aren't available to you now some of these just seem maybe heavy vehicle storage but what other what other uses here could you anticipate the owner of the property considering its location in a residential neighborhood or a zone or neighborhood would be reasonable so I can't answer that specifically because I'm not the property owner or uh but the the property owner purchased the the parcels with the designation were under the impression that the designation was industrial so they wish to just utilize the property for industrial uses at their Leisure uh for what it wasn't what it was done previously so at the at the previous hearing we discussed the timelines of when the property owner was uh purchasing it and our Salem and so that's where that error where the previous or where the seller didn't disclose that the Zone was being changed to something that was not real so as as much as I wish I could say that I know exactly what the current property owner wishes to do I I don't but they would like the allowance to utilize it as they purchased it thank you appreciate it is there anyone from the neighborhood justify all right so there's no one here from Association um any any public testimony as long as this um uh do the Commissioners have any additional questions for sta now I'd be curious to know um from staff how you went about choosing which um which uses would be permitted and which uses would not be permitted sure um we compared both what was allowed in the current rm2 zoning with what would be allowed in the IG Zone and that's how we structured the list um a lot of it was based off of the previous case um turn Ro where there was a lot of similar igti and mostly we looked at what industrial EES we consider to be more noise traffic potion so what sorry could you refresh my memory of what is currently being stored and done on the property uh currently there is a vehicle storage and warehousing St so the is it's not it's not commercial parking because it's not a public parking lot it's it's a tenant who is or is it is it the owner's equipment that's par there my understanding is it's the owner's equipment okay okay so they wouldn't NE according to the list it wouldn't necessarily be precluded from executing the lease and storing vehicles or commercial equipment so long as it wasn't commercial parking it can still generate potentially Revenue out of leasing the property out for storage of industrial equipment so long as they're not doing sales or service or heavy vehicle Sales service and let's see vehicle and Trailer Service and Storage so it could potentially be least for equipment storage and material partment as I read this is maybe I guess I guess where this is coming from is is I I I sympathize on on both levels I understand that the owner is between a rock and a heart place and that the city also has uh concerns of the community in the neighborhood to uphold and so working within the um condition one of the recommended not permitted uses how do you still use this as a industrial type site um and if they but if they are still able to generate a use out of it while being in compliance then it might accomplish both this is what I'm trying to for St wants to add that all of the ideas I'm filling in for administrator uh so I guess I would add is there all every one of these has like a bunch of different categories of what is in there so heavy vehicle storage um would be wouldn't be just your pickup truck stored um I think it would be helpful if we knew what the equipment was for um because based off of what the equipment is for that would probably fall into a use so it's difficult to pinpoint what use they would fit under without knowing what the equipment is that's being stored um if it's just vehicles um you know vehicle services would be the storeage so that it wouldn't be allowed under under the condition as proposed um again PL commission could edit um this there are some uses that are allowed um warehousing um that are going to continue to be allowed um and those are pretty low impact um again without knowing what's in there in particular it's hard to fit it into the box in the code I know that's UNH helpful look I open this Rabbit Hole I don't know where it's going but um I I guess I guess where I'm coming from is is in in my daily course of action when I see an NFA it's it's a it's double short it's a relief that there is DEQ oversight but it's also a red flag of there is some sort of known issue so how do we work with a property owner around this issue of what is known to accomplish what is best for the community as well as what is best for the property owner and um as I look through the list I'm thinking okay what what can they do here well it appears that a sizable trunk and I guess a percentage 63% has been eliminated uh I think we can eliminate some but i' like to see it maybe a little bit less than that because uh manufacturing for example if you're going to manufacture shelters you're going to store them outside is that General manufacturing or is that light manufacturing um excuse me I think that uh are you are you just expressing your opinion or because that's that's what we talk about afterwards do you have questions specifically for the applicant or this staff because I think you're what you're talking about is very interesting i' like to hear more I can I can hold okay my tongue that would help uh if there no questions for the applicant of the staff uh or request oh do you have I just have a question to clarify um I cannot speak to it is that correct or ask questions I think you can be involved in discussion I think you can be involved in the discussion and ask questions it might potentially problems actually vote but I think it's okay for you ra issues yes okay so are there any more any more questions for okay sorry go ahead little so the you know 6 % is calculated basically as the number of uses eliminated as compared to the number of uses um which seems like a big number and and it is but do we have any idea of in terms of the industry that's in sale percentage that would be instead of just saying there's a list of 100 things and there's 63 you can't do if 60 of those things are things we never do anyways that doesn't seem like a big loss so are uses that that were blocking there are they things that happen around here a lot or are they pretty infrequent uses because I guess to me if they're infrequent uses I'm not really concerned how many infrequent uses for blocking but if there are things that get uh utilized around here frequently that that does seem very serious and so I'm curious if we have any idea we could like wait these I don't have that kind of information on hand right now I can probably check with our long range cers what amount of land that's designated for uses but how many actual uses are established I I I don't think we have the data to support that um there are some things on here I've never seen come through in the nine years I've been here um maybe a handful of them I mean there's not very much surface mining in in s besides the things that have been existing um you know we don't do a whole lot of waste related facilities Marine facilities are do far between um but a lot of these we I mean I think that there are things on here that come in routinely um you know the aviation facilities I would imagine would only be around the airport

making process um that is I think about to conclude do I have that right Alan you were Alan was sitting right next to me at the meeting um and there's concern from the business Community especially about how they will reduce their use of um you know different fossil fuel types to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and I felt very happy um as a member of the trans board uh all the attention and direction we have been taking in Greening our Fleet and um sort of reducing that because the the concern from the business Community is that it will increase the cost of doing business and then that we'll have to pass on to the consumer um so that was a very informative meeting with some very strong coffee there was some really strong coffee at that meeting um and then the Metropolitan Transportation safety action plan um comments were submitted from the steering committee uh on the 22nd of July so Monday um on version two version three we'll have an online open house between August 4th uh or August 4th or 5th um and then the steering committee is meeting with a consultant over zoom on September 4th or 5th and then the scats policy committee will review the Metropolitan Transportation safety action plan on the 24th um I'm very hopeful I wish it could go further um but it is a regional plan that involves all of our partners within the mo and so there are some limitations um on people's feelings of comfort how much we should do um for safety um but some good guidance I think coming out of that plan and I will go into more detail um in the future and I'm sure you're looking forward to that and then I have to say a thank you to director Duncan for serving as my alternate and attending the scats meeting that took place earlier this week on the 23rd um and then I think it's next week on August 1st the grant neighborhood association meeting is departing from its normal location so that we can all go tour the new affordable housing apartments um at the former site of Evergreen Church on D I don't there's a name for that development and I can't remember what it was but that has been a project that has been long in process um from the neighborhood association and getting the permits to build and then moving forward with the construction I ride my bike by it every day on my way to work so I'm pretty excited to go inside and then finally just super relieved and happy to see punks in the park coming back and thank you to chariots for being a sponsor that was such an uplifting I'm not like a huge punk music fan but I'm a huge fan of that event it was so inclusive it was so uplifting um if you didn't go last year or any of the previous times that they have done it I really encourage you um to stop by and check it out and attend um and visit the Chariots Booth um because it's really just a fantastic Community event um and that is the end of my report thank you thank you very director thank you president noost pressy um so the State Transportation uh Improvement fund advisory committee did not meet this month um we did not get to meet with um mayor Clark and the rest of the representatives in Kaiser for coffee with Cathy um this last week there was some scheduling conflicts so that's going to happen tomorrow um so I don't have a whole lot to report there um but I just want to um emphasize that we are going to be doing the ribbon cutting on the bebs excuse me the battery electric buses um at the Kaiser Transit Center uh so I'm really excited about that and US inviting Senator Merkley and his team out there um let's see what else did I have we had oh the Kaiser Fest is coming up on the 11th uh August 11th um and to the point uh that director Carney just mentioned right now about um chariots getting out there and supporting other um events into the community I saw chariots out there at the Kennedy neighborhood council meeting they had a a family event that that was out there that was pretty um awesome it was actually well attended and uh which was really interesting for for Kaiser and how fast they put it together um how supportive they were of uh including other partners they had a um passport system so people could walk around and you'd have to you know uh interact with those booths to get that stamp um and then we stayed close to the very end and uh I I got to take my kids and so they won some prizes out there so that was really cool to attend and so yes team Chariot is showing up um and with that that concludes oh sorry no that doesn't conclude my report I got one more um AstroTurf at Kaiser Rapids uh so the construction on that is almost done um I did not get an opportunity to ask mayor Clark about um where we are in the process of including uh space for uh a bus to be able to get in there and make the turnaround so that um patrons at the park have access to public transportation um but I hope to do that tomorrow and um we're we're moving right along so um here's to you know

Personal account numbers are 213-1700 portion and 2131-7001 portion. Site address is 13123 Southwest 41st place, Ocala, Florida 34481. Those items are for your consideration. Very good. Is there anyone here that would like to see any one of the five of those pulled and heard evening seeing none. Ask for a motion from this board. Have a motion. Do we have a second? I, Mike Behar, second the motion. All those in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? None. We'll move right into those that we're going to hear this evening. 2.1. Good evening. Kenneth Odom. Transportation plant or guard services. Item number 240401 Su K nine rescue kennel is a request to continue to operate a rescue kennel for K nine s only being able to house up to 25 animals at this particular site. The site itself is just under 53 acres. It is located northwest of city of Ocala. It's a one general agricultural and rural lands surrounded by basically same parcels. A lot of agricultural misuse, a lot of larger parcels as well. This is a site plan that was submitted by the applicants. There are currently three kennels on site, as you can see, one, two and three. These are all located to the forward portion of the property, which is located just off of northwest 100th street, fairly close to the home of the applicant. There are also two larger, or, excuse me, three larger barns that are on site, two that actually, one has animals, one has avian birds in it. At this time, there is a larger barn on site that actually has a separate breeding facility for siberian Rottweilers, but it's not affiliated with this applicant. That space is being leased by the applicant's daughter in law. And we'll go into a little bit more information about that in just a few moments. This is the subject parcel. As indicated. The applicant's home is located here. The kennels are located at, basically this location, this location and then this location. The other barns, as I indicated, are on site. One is here. The birds are located in this particular location. And then the breeding location for the Siberian Rottweilers is at this location. There's also one horse that is still on site that I forgot to mention. This home that you currently see on site is not the primary domicile. That is actually in a modular facility that is located behind it. As it was indicated to us, this home is scheduled to be demolished. These basically are the photos you're looking at. This is the driveway entering the property. And the other three. This is one kennel. Kennel number one. Up in the front, there is one animal that's housed in that, a german shepherd. This is kennel two. This is almost immediately adjacent to the modular home that I indicated. There are a number of different animals that are located at this location. I would like to bring your attention to the picture in the middle right here. This is a light switch. These are lights. It also came to our attention that this particular location is not permitted through Marion county. No electrical permits were pulled. No concrete permits were pulled for the structure. The size of the structure alone would dictate that it would need to have a permit, much less having the electric attached to it and operational. Final kennel is to the north of the home, near adjacent to another barn. This is also where the additional runs are to the indication of the applicant to growth services staff and animal services staff. There are currently 20 canines on site. There are a few more smaller breeds that are actually located in the house with the applicant. These are the birds that are located in the area to the northwest. And this is the male horse, older horse, that is in the barn to the northeast. Staff is recommending denial of this particular application. And I mentioned the approval of the kennel for the Siberian Rottweiler before that was approved in October of this past year. This had. The applicant for that kennel had absolutely. The breeding kennel had absolutely nothing to do with the violations that you were seeing before you. These are a list of violations going back to 2012 under this particular applicant, many of which have to do with horses. There are repeated offenses. These are documented. These are all coming from animal services. Of particular interest coinciding with some of these are the items that you see on the right. The applicant was indicated or told that she needed to have a kennel licensure and that was indicated to her in 1027 2022. She was also deficient with some of the rabies vaccinations and other vaccinations for the animals that were currently being on are currently held on site at that time. Animal services cited Miss Romani after a number of repeated visits where there was no compliance for the Kennel licensure application. We finally received the kennel application this, or, excuse me, in January of this year, once the applicant was cited for this. So this will bear important into our final conclusion, and I'll get to that also in just a moment. As far as the previous application that I had mentioned to you with the breeding kennel for the siberian Rottweilers, as I mentioned, this is for her daughter in law. She leases the space. Her daughter has converted the space. That area has been inspected. It was improved by the board of county commissioners. It was recommended for approval by staff. However, condition number three that is included in the special use requirements for that SUP listed here, and it was based on the conditions that you just saw as far as repetitive violations under the animal services monitor. While the property is owned by Judith Romani, Miss Romani is in no way to be affiliated with any operations of this kennel or be in any way responsible for the care of the animals within it. The animals and their care should be the sole responsibility of don toddle only. This is her daughter in law. This is on site. This was something staff included, but it was also insisted upon by the board of county commissioners when they were making their, or making their determination on this site. Staff is recommending denial at this location. You know, we. There was an identical analysis as far as the issues of compatibility and things like that. The effect on the impact on the neighborhood itself. It's the same property, the exact same property. However, there were different things that we had to take into account under this particular condition, and that includes with animal services. This was discussed at length in order to make this decision. So it's very important that I make sure that you're all aware of why there was one that was included that had an approval, and there's one that staff is recommending for denial and that is based on this statement, staff recommends denial of the applicant's request. It is the position of gross services staff, working closely with animal services staff that Miss Romani, through an extensive history of repeated violations and continued delays and attempts to obtain required licensure has exhibited a lack of fitness to operate an animal rescue of any type. Mister Justin McClure and other members of animal services are here. One of the instances that were on site were so bad that there had to be horses that were euthanized on site. If you look at the items that are included in the documentation that has been presented as an appendices to this report, and in the report, there are a number of items that are included in those violations that actually show miscare of animals, including simple things such as barriers, dead animals, on site equines, and then a point where all animals had to be removed from this site that coincided with the. The multiple animals that had to be euthanized. So with that, I believe Miss Ramoni and her agent, I believe her son is here with her. If you have any questions. Animal services is here as well. Quick question. Yes, sir. You said that on that electrical work that was done there, that was never permitted. It has not been permitted, sir. Staff and I have even had other members of staff try to see if I was missing something. We have a pretty. It's not a simple system, but it's pretty easy to find permits, and there have been no permits that were assigned for that. We haven't seen any permits that have been pulled in quite some time on that property. Based on that, what would be the determination of code enforcement? We. This just came to our attention after the site visit. So code enforcement will we know about it now? We've seen it. There potentially could be a citation, but they will have to go back and back, permit that location. In the event those dogs hadn't, the runs hadn't been put in that building, would it have still needed the permits? This is an sup. They're requesting up to 25 animals. No, I understand that, but had they just been built there on the farm, would it have still needed. They weren't going to do the dogs and didn't have the kennels in there. If they are. If",

        "text": " going to be that's going to be up to you I would fact if if we come to you for an easement I would be unafraid to factor that in to a request for compensation the goal the goal through that compensation is also and again I say it this way intentionally at the end you will feel less angry at us if we compensate you appropriately but if I put a line near your property I've never had anyone say thank you all right um any other okay I see one more um you mentioned that there's a small section of residence on hillbrow that already have transmission lines then stacked on top for single pole those go away at all if not the transmission lines but the high power lines go away Bill Gates drought yeah no no this doesn't replace alignment this is needed in addition so if there if there's a section of transmission line that is like the one that goes near Kirkland Road near the north we would double circuit it you would see a single set of poles with two sets of three wires or six wires or it will be on the other from the existing the existing ones the potential to see two sets of lines potentially depending on the location that is let's say that is a potential and you you do see that a lot especially in urban areas um in residential we do the best we can to avoid it kind of going back to our conversation earlier we're trying to find routes so we we have conflicting requirements as well some of the agencies like if this was a federal federal government process they actually require us to push it as close to existing lines and keep it away from impacting pristine areas or landowners who are impacted more negatively by numerous lines are going to ask us to push the lines further away and go where nobody's been bothered yet so I'm sorry I'm just confused because earlier when I asked my question about running a second set of lines parallel or piggyback existing ones you told me that there had to be this great distance between the lines now you're telling me in this case it's okay to put two sets of lines really close to each other remember what I said though they have to be on the same circuit so if I have a 115 KB line I can put it right next to a 230 kV line they are not on the same circuit they are not safe they are not serving the same loads and uh recipients you have to have two lines running from Lone bind to Whetstone have to be separated but if I have a 230 line that runs from somebody brought up Roxy Ann earlier that's a different circuit than a line between Lone Pine and Whetstone so that's what you have to keep in mind is what circuit are these serving if it's the same they have to be segregated if it's different they can be next to each what I suggested was having different the Redundant system would be a different circuited lawn correct no no it's redundancy of the same circuit because if it's two different circuits then the loss of something a line or a Transformer or a substation it doesn't impact the other circuit so making the other circuit more robust does nothing to help the circuit that we're worried about hopefully I'm making sense do you comment at all on the uh lawsuit yeah uh let's do the power and the I guess two billion lawsuits for the buyers will rub in Multnomah County area that's way above me I I have nothing to do with that acquires can happen absolutely and as it's been pointed out we're required to consider it and how to minimize the potential of it through our construction and our sighting you're aware of that kind of a PTSD of you know knowing that we're getting fired down here that these lines can and have awesome yeah I'm not just I'm not disputing that but I don't yeah I can't speak to it in detail I'm sorry English I'm sorry I just was asking is that the reason maybe you preferred that Eastern route no I I believe in looking at it in some of our studies to me it seems uh that the Eastern route is going to be found least impactful but it you know that's pre-decisional and I'm not making any choices but it's just off the cuff looking at it it seems it would not Shock me to find out that that's the way it pulls out so do we have any other comments or questions in the room or on the phone or nobody online and I forgot to mention earlier there's the gis station that I think some of you are already working at you can give them your property address and you'll actually see where the line is proposed to be in relation to your property so you may find that some of you don't have a line near you you've been contacted because you're within that area that we have to study okay well I think at this point we're going to adjourn our meeting if there's no further questions or comments but I do want to thank Pacific Power and Power Engineers for being here really want to thank the members of the public that have come to attend and if you haven't signed up for our notices um please chat with Erica before you leave and she'll get you signed up in the back of the room but thank you",

        "text": " we'll cut things back some leave it sorry so I'm just waned to make sure that we're capturing this kind of also I was thinking and I'm glad you're here Alan but like as we get ready to do this building project this building like what are we get I really want to be sure that we're capturing all of the energy efficiencies that we're going to be creating I mean I'm hoping that we get to the point where we start doing motion sensors in room so lights actually go off automatically you know those kinds of things but I'm hoping we're capturing that all of that kind of stuff and Reporting it yeah those kind measures construction so it's just a matter of make sure and right right so actually you know show that we're making some progress right LS all that stuff and Council your it's kind of at Le two prong approach one of course is our own operations and turn over into battery powered whatever we've got the other one is on our ongoing contracts as renew contracts with our service providers for landscaping what do we require and how we do that both those thanks for bringing that up mayor yeah it just struck me I mean it was fast to watch this Army of people like surrounding building blowers they really love their blowers so we have to we have to walk softly yes I'm familiar I actually had to discontinue the employment of a landscaping through at my house because they were so enamored with their gas bar yeah well my husband really likes his and so he and I have I have an electric one it's amazing I know I really I just have to be able to switch over all right sorry no that was excellent um additions so how this could look like um again ke trucky green did a couple really great um aspects of their dashboard um they had their renewable diesel usage and um how much they consumed uh and then what their uh avoided uh carbon dioxide equivalency was so for municipal Fleet U most of these measures are um available internally but they might not be reported as we are looking for so they won't be easy to use but um after we manage them and make sure that we're tracking um those measures they should be easy to report going forward um they would all be for uh mitigation and because they would be all internal operations be able to act on those so for solid waste um one of the main measures is pounds per person per day and then we can break that down to what type of waste they are generating and we can also compare it to State and National averages um though we would expect to have a lower per capita waste um per day because uh City of Salem has access to um Recycling and composting which not all rural areas have access to um and then if we want to get really fancy with our data we can look into the epa's warm model and do a emissions inventory of the waste audit categorization of the types of waste that we're um generating we can also look at diversion rates from various customer types so single family residential commercial and multif family and then construction and demolition um and then we could also have exhil measures such as litter cleanup reporting on those metrics as well as um using some other data that's being generated so um Ryan and the team are have created a GIS map for trash card size so using other measures that are available we can always um kind of capitalize on those and Report out as well we have a GIS map of trash card size brand new caught off the press wowor sorry yeah I want to see that thing yeah that's fascinating I missed this when we briefed earlier trash card size is the the big trash small trash can the big size cool 30 do they go into yardage sorry I I believe that since those measures are being collected you could report those out so I think that it would just be adding a different layer onto the gis map so I believe so I'll wait for her Solid Waste sorry I'm might of giving you too much of a preview there y It's s good um so how this data could look being reported out um the one thing I will say on this one it's from uh City of Redmond Washington sustainability dashboard they have it based on um annual tonnages I pref personally prefer uh pounds per person per day because these are too big of numbers for people to find compelling um but it does show kind of those ways um make up percentages and um it does track those year over year so um the caveat for the data availability is it's available for all of Maran County so we could extrapolate what is Salem's contribution so we wouldn't have any clear just Salem data what about C County we could get that as well I think that all of our solid weights goes through Maran County even the ones in no they're all under one group so like all eight haulers belong to one group so I think we would be getting that data from that group and then it would represent yeah that was my take on the information but I can certainly follow out um so um application of that would be for mitigation and um again we're asking for Behavior change so not actionable um the EPA War model it would be adding a layer of complexity so it would not be easy to use but it would give more um information on emissions um and then diversion rates from various customers um again that would be available and easy to use um and for mitigation as ecosystem services so the Natural Resources Group already is doing a tree canopy inventories um so they would we would be able to pull that data and report back out um I would like to have it down to the percentage coverage and four census blogs um and they are working on a tree inventory and by getting the number of tree species we could also um um get the carbon sequestration from those ecosystem Services um we could also do air quality uh particulate matter measures as well as the number of repairing Zone improvements that we um question we have the annual tree survey right that's already annual I believe it's done annual that's what I thought okay thank you plus we have all of that now and it's become a lot easier to do a canopy analysis one point it was done every 10 years that's all do y so um this is how some of these dashboards can look like um giving uh the area of canopy gain loss and where there's been no change um and that can uh be available in the acreage as well jul have you met with the gis guy yes good I was say you should just sit down at his desk one day and just have him go through all the things because it's pretty amazing need more than a day what's that you might need more than a day you might need more than a day yeah but to get the the mayor level view the day would be but he has he has access to some amazing pair yes um he is helping with getting all of this put together and he's going to be part of the very instrumental theme in getting it basing uh so tree canopy yes it's available it's already being used so it be easy to pull and kind of re- report um the application for that would be for mitigation adaptation resiliency and Equity that one is kind of the allstar of these um is it actionable yes uh tree canopy and carbon sequestration I coupled these in this one because on once we get all of the data it would be make sense to have it all reported out together um since it's not complete and um because the carbon sequestration metrics would be difficult to add on it's not um necessarily easy to use yet but once we have it it would be easier to use and report on then um also one of the allstars it would be applicable for mitigation adaptation resilien and equity and again is actionable um finally air quality measures these are available through third parties um it would be moderately easy to use once those were pulled in but I'm not sure if it would necessarily add anything additional to the conversation there are different dashboards that already have these metrics available and are publicly reported so it might be something that we prefer to just link outward to instead of um using our time and resources to re-report on their data um it would be for mitigation and um because we aren't the regulatory Authority for any air pollutants um it wouldn't be actionable water conservation um so we're looking at the main metric for this is gallons per capita per day we could go through averages uh monthly averages year-over-year possibly break it down by neighborhood um California did see that when they reported it down to the neighborhood level they were seeing um inter neighborhood uh shaming and that was something that was reported positively on conservation um efforts so possibly something that we look we could do it by neighborhood association just really feel that fire can can we do water consumption by type of user I think that would be important I think we can do that as well you um and then rain data so um weeks with less than one inch rain are really the only times that you should be um Watering your Landscaping so recording so reporting that out might be important to message that maybe people don't need to um water their Landscaping yeah how would you do like how would that would are there cities that do that and Absol look like um is it like a public announcement some people have a weekly um watering suggestion and it would tell you how much you need to water and on you know 50 plus weeks a year they say no watering is needed in that little weekly email that goes out so some some cities do that um coming from Texas that was a pretty common thing that was sent out interesting surpris not something more I mean maybe we could do an app have we ever thought about doing an app the the challenge with this is the only months that something this information is really relevant is probably made May and September U given our weather patterns right so we almost never get an inch of rain in a week June July August and this and We Know It November December January's like so um I'm not sure this is the most useful yeah it's cute so because a lot of cities have the historic data um you can have these nice uh charts like Santa Fe New Mexico on their sustainability dashboards showing the really uh conservation positive trend and going down from the last 30 years um most of these metrics are available internally and they would be moderately easy to U manipulate and use they would be for M uh mitigation and resiliency in",

        "text": " a leader uh kind of on the national and international scale and so these are kind of some of the things that this Council has allowed us to move into those uh different other uh Arenas as we move forward so next slide so the first one probably something that many of you are partners with is that there is uh the Pacific coast collaborative the PCC that many of us are aware of um there is a subcommittee for um oah um that has then since broken off and become uh the OA Alliance which we'll go into more on the next slide but um this group has really done a lot of work to kind of form across border efforts to look at ocean change kind of uh centralized messaging associated with oah so that the whole West Coast is looking at things in a unified front or presenting it in a unified front um and things like that again really with the main goal of a centralized message for the West Coast um in our introduction to science you know ocean acidification is hitting the West Coast United States harder than anywhere else so this is really the place where these kind of things need to be brought up and so this is why the PCC is a really good group to be able to push that messaging um so that's what one of the Arenas we work in next slide please and then like I said the PCC is uh spurred off into the ocean acidification Alliance which is now become a un foundation and um or yes one of the foundation on the UN and this has become a international effort that works with uh many groups to um establish action plans throughout the world um to combat ocean certification um as you can see looking right here on their website on the top row is Oregon we are one of the first groups and we have uh been kind of an important group that is um cited and referenced going forward by many other countries and subnationals and things like that so while we are just a state we do really have um some important precedents that we have set for many other groups in uh the past so um that's just a nice benefit that has come from our work our slide so that's what we have for kind of our background of what um we've done trying to keep things kind of uh quick and easy um so then our next thought is we chatted Lori Jenny and I a little bit about how we thought we might be able to align with you at the Oregon global warming commission but again this is is just us thinking and spitballing we're totally open we'd love to have more conversations we hope that this collaboration can really become something that's uh more consistent more permanent as we definitely have a lot of things that we're crossing over with one another is in our um Works um so here's some examples of um shared priorities in both of ours is we both have things that are discussing limit climate change impacts on organ's cultural and economic viability including the fishing industry we have a fishing industry seat I know you guys are going to be adding one that's something we can definitely partner with you on um reducing the causes of climate change is also in both of our plans mitigate and adapt to climate change through advancing natural climate and natural working land Solutions again so many similarities in the types of things we're doing that it would be really beneficial for us I think to formalize and continue to really collaborate as we continue going forward next so um here's kind of our next big steps we have as a council we do need to um draft and put together our 2024 legislative report and then we're also that house bill 3114 that Jenny was talking about we're just finalizing that so we have kind of the wrap up of those with the final wrap up being a Communications plan that the council can be using to uh help us going forward and uh introducing this information and then the last thing is we will be developing our next action plan for dissemination 2025 next slide so that's our contact information that's what we have um I so I guess kind of like Erica we'd like to just kind of point out are there things where you guys think we can partner questions for us thoughts Lori do you want to chime in quickly have anything you want to say I do have one thing I'd like to add so so especially keeping note that we're going to develop our action plan once again in 2025 this is a great opportunity for us to put our heads together and think about ways that we can support your work moving forward and we can advocate for work that benefits both of us that's great thank you uh great presentation really uh interesting to hear um about the work that you're doing and um it's such an important uh area of um impact uh that we um that we need to be having front and center in our thinking um one question for me and then I'll open it up for other Commissioners how how closely do you connect with with Oak and does your information kind of get integrated or do you do any kind of crossposting of this the work that you're advancing and the work that Oak so to my knowledge there hasn't been much um cross-pollinating between the two groups like I said I'm relatively new so uh Jenny or Lori tell me if I'm wrong but we Jenny and I were just talking after Erica's talk during the break that that's something we feel like we should increase and build a better relationship because there's definitely a good Nexus between us doing those kind of things yeah I know coordination with acre is within our action plan and it's something that we have found to be a priority moving forward I do believe at the beginnings of the council there was more coordination but we have had some changes in seats and um I think some of those connections had been lost but that's definitely something that we intend to put back together moving forward that's great one of the um things we've been considering is just the public you know doesn't really know where all to look for things so um being able to be something of a clearing house for information uh and current things to to have some C crossposting on our um commission website is something that you know would be great to do and um and then you know potentially with as Zach mentioned earlier with some of our um seats for agent state agencies um moving over to being on the commission there may be some opportunity to uh collaborate more formally in part by you know having representation on the on the um on the commission so it' be great to follow up on that yeah questions thoughts about how to collaborate commissioner rman here again I I'm glad to always learn more about things that I didn't know about before but um it seems kind of discouraging because there's not I don't see anything specific that we can do other than the suite of of uh mitigation that we do climate change mitigation but I'm curious why it why is it worse off the Oregon coast than other places uh the prevailing West Wind from Asia is that why or are we just unlucky Lori are you comfortable chiming in with that you're far more skilled at the chemistry than the rest us thank you uh yeah and pardon my voice I have a I'm losing my voice so um yeah so it has to do with a little bit of the um the shape of our Coastline and um retentiveness of um water as it's upwelled so um if we have really strong upwelling and it's blown offshore really quickly that keeps a fresh supply of at least not super low oxygen it's low o o what's coming up um but if if we get um upwelling and then we get reversals of winds and things kind of stagnate it allows that production to be um deposited locally and consume the oxygen locally and then that's when you get a big problem so it has to do with intermittency of winds and H uh how broad the Shelf is generally speaking we have a narrow Coastline but there's places around heck B where there's a little bit more retentiveness in the circulation and and that can matter too to um things kind of getting trapped thank you thank you there questions or comments thoughts collaboration well we'll definitely give it some more thought um and um and uh appre really appreciate the opportunity to um to look look for ways to better collaborate going forward thank you for giving us the opportunity we appreciate thank excellent okay great um and I would just encourage um the Commissioners to take a look at um the work uh that U we just heard about more closely as well as the sixth assessment that we that Erica presented earlier and uh to follow up with thoughts on collaboration you're welcome to send them to Zach Andi and we can comile com combine ideas and get those forwarded to um the two groups of present the two groups of presenters that we heard from today so thank you so um one thing I'd like to have have folks do if you haven't already let us know the if you want to comment during the public comment period if you could let us know while we're listening to the next uh presentation just so that oh I'm sorry um Jenny Hester you have sorry that was a mistake I'll unra my hand okay thank you uh so it let us know if you want to provide public testimony um we are now a little ahead of schedule so I don't see any reasons why we won't have plenty of time but but do let us know we'd appreciate that and um with that I'll turn to our last uh uh presentation uh commissioner Decker and um Garrett Martin are with us here from the p uh at our last meeting we touched very briefly um commissioner Decker gave us a bit of an overview of what uh is happening relative to the integrated resource planning that the utilities do and the commission uh assesses but we wanted to it's such an important area of work uh as we discussed in the road map the importance of getting um the programs that are uh in House Bill 2021 that was focused on electric utilities and the the CP P um work that also includes our natural gas utility um getting those uh right uh and making sure that they're uh being supported for Effective implementation is is is really critical so um I think it's important for the commission to continue to kind of keep uh this the work that's needed to to make these things happen front of mine so I appreciate um commissioner Decker's U willingness to kind of give us a deeper view of this work so with that I'll hand it",

um I moved the Sherwood Planning Commission to approve the application for Moser pass case File d020 PUD Su um based on the applicant testimony public testimony received and the analysis findings and conditions in the staff I'll second all right it's been moved and seconded that we approve uh mure pass final development and finals Subdivision plat land use file Lu 2022020 any further discussion all in favor say I I I I commissioner Capco thank you uh any opposed motion passes unanimously thank you very much and I think that is a good benefit to the um all right um moving back to my agenda we are done with public hearings and moving to commissioner comments um I was going to ask if we had the charter review of I sh wild DOA the um committee wrap up its work did it wrap up the work great question so uh since I am getting my emails from the city no problems with the new Duo uh dual mobile authentication uh got my first emails and scheduling for uh today actually earlier today we'll be having that meeting well we we've all throughout dates at work for us so sometime in mid-march we'll be getting together for our first meeting oh okay there you go all right sorry is the city Charter is that you said City Charter review the charter review you all right and then next week definitely if you're interested in the Sherwood West the city council meeting will be of interest any other we we have the I think our ethics thing we coming up we have to do just for oh that's right statement of e economic interest due to the city or to the state by April 15th if you haven't received your email from them I don't doesn't start quite yet open next month but it's coming up yeah they haven't opened it up yet and if not yeah so if you haven't served previously you will you should be getting an email if you don't get an email from this state regarding your annual submitt a reach out to Joy um who's someone else usually does it for the Sylvia does it for city um all right I had had one other thought that hit me tonight I'm just going to float um based on the first application it wasn't part of the criteria for that but it got me thinking um our code is very specific to design standards within a certain amount of feet from particular material but this one like you mentioned is so high up are there should we be considering design standards for like visibility like if you're on top of a hill or like Skyline you know standards or something like that so so I do know like Portland have very specific Scenic views that are preserved um where they require certain buildings so that they can stagger each other so that their views aren't completely I mean that might be something that we might you know if you guys want to think about moving forward with that as far as amendments to the code U but then we would have to identify where those Scenic views are I think that would be good thing when we go go through Sherwood West right now we're a lot of Hills out there we're built up here but Sherwood West when we go through that process let's make sure that we remember that scenic view well I think we need to establish Scenic corridors and then from there we have to establish view sheds and then you know Scenic overlay and then it goes into visual simul visual Sims of project developments from Cen corridors so the best part of anything you know we just went through the concept planning so the next phase if um if we get approved in regards to the ugb ask is the comprehensive um plan for Sherwood West and that's when we're actually talking about like all the middle housing zoning you know the details in regards to the zones but also putting zoning down but discussing Scenic if that's something that we want to address during that um and it's several year process so yeah it just struck me as interesting that this doesn't matter for the road right next to it but everybody else around see you know which wasn't this isn't it wasn't appropriate for the particular public area night because it's not code but thinking about the future you know perhaps buildings on a mountain what do they look like absolutely and I think you know staff is is willing to um follow the policy direction of the of the policy makers which in part is um you know informed by your guys' you know everything that you do here because uh city council is not going to get this application that we just heard right it's it's you guys and so they might not no I mean of course you have your l on here um but you know they're not going to know all these details and so that's where you know you've asked many time you know what's what's the role between the Planning Commission it's it's exactly this as well so uh we just did goal setting um for city council and that's where that you know that would come from so there's a little bit of a process to get what you're talking about you know to staff basically it's got to go and get on City council's radar through some and we need to work out exactly how Planning Commission is is informing uh city council but that's how it happen is it gets on City council's radar then during the goal setting that we do annually city council says we need to you know update our code to address this and so um that's why I thought i' floated I mean I know we're not decision makers of the council is but if you guys thought that was of interest and it might be something to bring back to them and I think definitely putting it on the radar for sure would West because that's a a blank slate right now for code and implementation of the of the plan it's at the detail level plan yeah things things we learn along the way jumping on those coat tails and very related to be tree code or tree you know simar to what Leo does because there's going to be a lot of force in Sherwood West so y people want to have a say and so that's something yeah and I'll just you know clarify for Sherwood West what I just mentioned it throw that out the window we're going to be working with you as Planning Commission closely on what Sherwood West looks like and what the what the tree code looks like what you know and so we'll get into that you guys do have a role more formal role in forming all of that so what I just mentioned was talking employment area current code current zoning if we need to change anything it's got to come but you guys were taking things through you and that goes to city council for Sherwood West so you guys will have the opportunity for Sherwood West to wait until all that stuff yeah so who's the project lead on Sherwood West it's me now okay because I would put it as some bullet points of the don't don't forget we discussed this because sure when we when we get into the um looking at 1900 acres and we're going to start looking at Big pictures and we may forget some of these other things like okay we want to talk about trees we want to talk about Evergreen percentages we want to talk about view corridors we want to talk about these things now but when we get into the next thing we're going to be talking about midle housing and design standards and what the state's doing to us and what we are able to do and so we may get lost in the weeds there and forget about some of the other stuff so project yeah we'll get it definitely get it in the minutes in terms of commissioner comments um something tells me you won't forget Jean so please do please do bring it up again but I'll we'll make a note as well yeah that's why I've got really smart Commissioners too because they've got great ideas that are coming forward so I also uh heard that you en Joy presented at Washington County Sherwood West this morning we did yeah this afternoon it went well it's well received um they like the variety of housing the middle housing there um some concern comments about transportation of course and just the overall impact to the to the County transportation system but um overall very it's been very the plan has been very well received everywhere we've gone Metro uh policy boards Washington County Etc and joy and I will continue to make the rounds we're doing a youth youth cohort uh presentation and the next month or two uh committee on racial Equity at at Metro we're sort of making the rounds um and so yeah but I do agree with um chair Simpson um and you guys are free to provide testimony if you'd like as planning Commissioners through this resolution that's going to Council on on the next council meeting on March 5th so if you guys have testimony happy to take it in writing or or verbally but that'll be really where they authorize us to submit the full application to Metro all right I am I have nothing else if there's no other comments we'll go ahead and adjourn the meeting commissioner cap so nothing no I'm good thank you for letting me join Zoom this is perfect thank you all right we we are adjourned and Eric I found",

        "text": " that's marked up um that's posted to the the rack SharePoint and we can just kind of walk through those and give folks an opportunity to provide input and provide comment as we as we go through and um kind of answer any questions if there if there are any um and then mainly you know mainly kind of take notes and and listen for for rack input we probably won't make won't be able to make too many like direct modifications on the Fly today but what we want to get is is that input as we walk through so that we can then go back and and address it so um I'll see make sure I can kind of make this large enough for folks to read O Okay so starting with chapter four is the compliance requirements chapter of standard 100 and um you know one of the things that that that I've noticed and I'm sure you've noticed too is that the ashray standard itself um refers to different sections of the standard quite a bit as you go through um where you know it so chapter 4 even though it's titled compliance requirements still refers a lot and kind of references and leans on future chapters that we still haven't gotten to yet in our in our review so it what it really does is it kind of provides that initial charging language um kind of an outline for um buildings to to point to different sections about okay if you know if a building has um targets then it needs to comply with you know with these future sections of the of the standards so even though it's called compliance requirements it's a it's more of an outline for the requirements so just kind of keep that in mind and one of the things that we' that we're we're considering we like to be able to do as we work through the future sections of the standard is to potentially consolidate some of these to make it a little bit more um you know a little bit more intuitive with the way that it's the the way that it's organized one of the things that we're kind of recognizing is that you end up when you're reading the stand itself end up jumping from one section to the next um that's something that we're kind of keeping in mind as we go through but I'm we're I'm not really sure exactly how much we'll be able to do that one of the main reasons is because in the end one of the main the final products that we're going to have is hopefully an integrated version of the standard 100 which we've worked with ashray to create a licensing agreement so that after we make our organ modifications we'll be able to go back and um create like an integrated ashray standard 100 for Oregon um and we'll work with ashray to do that and um similar to the way that Washington did it if you've seen that um where we have like different color text for the modifications that um that organs made so you know the more like reorganization that we do to the standard itself would make that integrated version just a little bit more challenging to um to manage and to to implement um so you know if there's any opportunities for kind of reorganization to simplify the structure you know without losing the substit pieces of it we'll definitely look for those but um just one thing to kind of keep in mind as we go through um so uh with with the compliance forms um compliance requirements section four and 4.1 um starts to talk about the forms for recording information and demonstrating compliance with the standard and ashray puts all these forms in a normative appendix um appendix a and um we we have we haven't gotten yet to this appendix a but that'll be part of a future W meeting but what it really does is it just provides all the information that will need to be reported to document compliance with the BPS um and they're mostly in like paper form you know format we do not plan on requiring paper um you know paper submittals for anything um we will ultimately have a software platform that hasn't yet been specified to document and Report compliance um but you know this appendix normative appendix a in the ashray standard if you're familiar with the Washington BPS it's very similar to Washington it's called nxz um in the Washington but we Washington BPS but it'll be similar to that and we'll cover that in a future meeting but um basically what we were trying to do here was just specify that the compliance forms will need to be submitted to Odo as the authority having jurisdiction um and will be done electronically in a manner that we specify um at a future date we just that's not part of the process now that's more part of implementation after after Ru makings complete so now we'll talk a little bit about the building type uh requirements um so a building or a complex of buildings whose majority of gross floor area has activities um in table 7.1 and what so I can go to table 7.1 next but um shall comply with the requirements of section of this section you know pretty much 4.3 uh 4.4 and 4.5 um and what table 7.1 does is it really outlines I'll just skip there for now um it outlines all the different covered building types so um what we did here is just pulled the different covered building types from the you know basically from the Washington um list and those are all based on Energy Star portfolio manager building types and subtypes um and then we removed the tier 2 type buildings from this list so this just covers all the tier one buildings that will ultimately have a Target associated with them for most of the building types um for compliance so it kind of points a user to this table to reference their building type and reference their Target and then says for those types of buildings you um you've got a look toward the compliance requirements in chapter and then for um so for tier one buildings is kind of The Next Step um the covered buildings the qualified person um determining compliance shall determine whether or not the building seeking compliance has targets um and then you know maybe I'll take this opportunity to talk a little bit about what qualified person is so if we kind of go back to our definition from the last time so this is where there is some requirement you know some certification level required to be the qualified person that's actually performing the um the analysis for you okay what is the building energy use intensity how does it compare to the Target and the one that's ultimately tasked with doing the reporting um to um for compliance to Odo so you know right now we've got a number of criteria where a person would qualified as that qualified person and that's either a licensed architect or engineer um an energy auditor a certified energy manager a person with a building operator um level two commissioning professional and um Energy Management professional or um and this is one that we've we've added after some discussion um with Lane Community College so somebody with Lane Community College Energy Management building controls program degree um and then we've got this kind of open ended so in the future we might identify additional certifications that would qualify somebody to be a qualified person for um for program reporting purposes so we've kind of left it open there if we do determine that there's another qualification that would match um so so again it's I have a question for you um I'm having a hard time reading the screen too is it possible to increase I can yeah let's oh thank you is that getting any better yes thank you yeah thanks for um on the qualified person you mentioned that there there's a qualified person for determine the eui uh meeting the eui target is and are you saying there's a different qualified person so that's like determining compliance um a different qualified person to submit the report um it could be the same qualified person okay was that question yeah yes so U the question I would have uh is actually a little bit separate but I don't think we get to it in ashray 100 is the savings to ratio um so with which qualified person would be determining that savings to investment ratio and and um is that going to be included in administrative rules for how Odo is going to evaluate that that seems like it's a fairly easy way out yeah so we haven't gotten yet to that that save that investment criteria pathway um but if there but it sounds like there's some interest in creating some criteria for the person that makes determination is that kind of where you're where you're going with that um yeah I'm just wondering if it seems like it's two different sets of qualifications yeah so um with I mean if if somebody's doing an energy audit to determine the savings they would need to be a qualified energy auditor so there's that other level of certification and that's either right now it's either having a ashray building energy um assessment professional or a certified auditor um certification or a licensed architect or engineer um so there's you know there's some level of qualification to get to the point to to be the one to do the energy audit um which would inform the Energy savings um and investment too but no that I mean that that is an area that we've heard from our counterparts um in other states that that have implemented it but that that could be a challenge to um to to avoid that I think that loophole that you're probably um hinting at of you know somebody or a building owner just saying that hey there's there's no coste effective energy measures for us to do all all the savings the investment ratios are you know less than one um and and potentially using that investment criteria pathway as a um you know as a way out oh go ahead where in and um would that be included in administrative rules is that something that we look at later after ashray 100 or should we be looking at as we are talking about qualified persons now yeah I think that'll be part once we get to the savings um that investment criteria pathway sections of the rules I think I think that's when we can have a little bit more deeper discussion about it but I think it will be part of the rules um but it's not part of the chapters today MH but I'm taking some okay hi Blake so just a quick followup on that I guess which meeting do you expect that we'll get to this piece just so we can do some thinking about it in advance yeah I think I'll have to look at our our schedule I don't have it off the top of my head um but but maybe what um actually well right now let's see",

        "text": " justification for that was based on an evaluation of any changes of factor law that occurred between the time the council originally approved the facility and determined that there was not any any substantive changes in fact or law there was minimal interest by the public and all of the issues that were raised by reviewing agencies were addressed so based upon that assessment overall i can get into the specifics if anybody has the uh we the department determined that type b was justified and made that determination and that determination was sent to council on the same date august 12th as well so it's just a reminder the way that that process works is once the staff makes the determination only the applicant under type b can the review of that to council so that one holds unless the applicant or the certificate holder themselves wants to raise that to next on my list is the bonanza energy facility this is a proposed 150 to 300 megawatt solar pv project with up to 1100 megawatts of battery storage the facility would be located on 2700 acres so 4.2 square miles located just outside the town of bonanza in klamath county the project is still at the notice of intent stage and so we anticipate receiving a preliminary application for site certificate later this year but again important to know we do not have a application as of yet there was a meeting by members of the in the vicinity of the project last wednesday we alerted you to that meeting in case any council members wanted to attend that meeting and so we provided that information to um just as a kind of a overall we we've continued to get um comments received from members of the public about this project we're not in a public comment time frame uh there are specific public comment time frames in our process nonetheless you know people continue to express um interest and concern about this project many of them have asked for those comments to be passed on to the council we have continued to pass on those comments to council as they come in and the last one that we received was from elizabeth hubbard if i'm pronouncing her name correctly um and that was included in your round two packets so last friday for this so just want to make sure that that that was on the record for both council and anybody who is interested in that project who might be listening today next are wildlife monitoring and mitigation updates uh and these are specific to the leaning juniper wind 2a and leaning juniper wind 2b projects in june of this year you were provided with wildlife monitoring and mitigation plan updates for several win facilities based on annual reports that were submitted to the department at that time ovengrid renewables the certificate holder for both the leaning juniper projects reported that no 2020 surveys or monitoring per the plan requirements was conducted due to covid19 these projects are located in gillum county just so you know even though those uh surveys were not done in 2020 they were rescheduled for 2021 and were completed in the spring and um the certificate holder submitted the reports and findings of the washington ground squirrel and raptor nest surveys conducted in april and may of this year and there were no significant findings or changes reported in those inventories so even though code kind of put some limitations on what they could do they did follow up they did the surveys found no substantive changes or significant issues so these reports and findings have been reviewed by the department and we've uploaded them to the specific web pages for the projects and they are open for public comment until october 20th of this year in case anybody wants to provide public comment next is the bigelow canyon wind farm this is a 450 megawatt wind facility consisting of 217 turbines located in sherman county on august 19 we received notice from portland general electric who is the certificate holder that a hawk hit an overhead line hitting the line caused a spark which started a fire that grew to approximately 26 acres and ended up burning a dilapidated house and old farm equipment before it was put so as with all site certificates the certificate holders have a 72 hour notification requirement to the department on incidents like these so portland general electric met that provided us that information the basic information within 72 hours and they're continuing to look at the issue and so that's really all of the information that i have at this point in time but we will continue to look further into it make sure that there are no violations of conditions of approval and we understand sort of the reasoning behind that so that's still sort of too to be determined um with some more before i move to the last update i just want to make sure that there were no questions on that okay seeing none last on my list is the golden hills wind project this is a 200 megawatt wind energy facility in sherman county that has just recently begun construction we recently earlier this week received an inspection request from adjacent farmers so we have a process by which if somebody believes that there are violations of conditions of approval they can request an inspection by us to make that verification of whether or not there are violations of conditions and so the farming operators have expressed concerns that the construction is occurring in violation of several site conditions excuse me site certificate conditions related to fugitive dust top soil management the size of the disturbance areas for each of the turbines and some of the facility layouts which in fact will impact long-term agricultural operations so avengrid renewables who is the certificate holder is aware of these concerns they have submitted a response already to us we are currently evaluating both the concerns that were expressed as well as avin grins bobbing grid's response and dwayne kilzonk are hearing or excuse me our compliance officer likely to conduct a site visit early next week so at this point we're just gathering information we're just evaluating it we have no idea if there is truly a violation of conditions of approval or not um again just in the fact-finding sort of stage of making that determination so i'll follow up with council next month on what we find related to these concerns that were expressed to us and last on my list i already talked about this a little bit is the september council meeting that is the dates are scheduled for september 23rd and 24th we do need a council meeting we only need a one-day council meeting so only on the 24th because of the increase in the delta variant with covid we will likely continue to have virtual meetings uh for the for the near future um so just probably being on the safe side that makes the most sense and i had indicated that council member jenkins and councilmember would not likely be available so the remaining five council members had all expressed their availability so i just wanted to check in to make sure that there are no changes to anybody's availability on the 24th probably a shorter meeting but just to make sure because we still all five other council members in order to have a quorum i wanted to make sure there were no changes in people's okay silence works for me and so i will take that is that we have madam chair that concludes my secretary report unless there are any questions for me i will turn it back over to you thank you any questions for todd i don't see any questions for you yep i don't yeah and i'm looking at you not see any so thank you great thanks so as i previously stated the next agenda item related to the boardman to hemingway transmission line since i've previously recused myself on all boardmen to hemingway action items i'm similarly going to recuse myself on agenda items b and c and turn over the running of those items to vice chair howe vice chair hal thank you for being willing to do this and i will turn it over to you at this okay um thank you chair grill um and as a mature girl said earlier if is wanting to speak and i am unaware of it please interrupt let me know so i can recognize you so what we have here for item b is a motion to remove the boardman to hemingway contested case hearing officer jesse ratcliffe oregon department of justice senior assistant attorney will provide an overview of the request by mrs irene gilbert to remove oregon office of administrative hearing senior administrative law judge allison greene webster as the f-sec appointed hearing officer for the boardman hemingway contested case there will be there's been a request for oral testimony by ms gilbert and idaho power at the end and we will allow that for a limited time and we can discuss the time then so at this point um uh mr ratcliffe um the floor is yours thank you vice chair howe and members of the council um so my suggestion is that i'll go ahead and provide a very brief sort of introduction to the topic um and that we have oral argument following that um and then once that's done and we've heard essentially everything that the um that miss gilbert and idaho power have to say both in writing and orally at that point um i can jump back in and talk some more about um the standards legal standards governing uh the bias and incompetence grounds for requesting removal talk a little bit about how those standards apply to the issues that ms gilbert's raised so with that i guess i'd suggest that we go ahead and have the oral argument part of this okay um do you want me to jump in and uh do we have uh ms gilbert so ken excuse me this is handling did you want to talk about uh limiting the time period for these presentations correct yes that's a good point thank you yeah so uh i'm thinking uh two or three minutes per uh on this what's the rest first the pleasure of the council as far as oral testimony from miss gilbert and idaho power oh this is handling i think three yeah this is jordan i agree i think three minutes is good this is perry i agree also i'll go with that it sounds like we've got a a time limit then of three minutes and uh do we have ms gilbert online ready to irene gilbert is unmuted and ready to go okay miss gilbert you can start your oral testimony for three minutes is anyone hearing her this is can't i'm hearing anything miss gilbert if",

        "text": " be able to just email your friends your family or people you just want to talk to about a project through this project as we mentioned we talked to so many representatives local governments tribal governments and stakeholders across sectors and they helped us figure out you know this is the level of reporting that could support data-driven and productive discussions around renewable energy and that aligns with our goals and the need for a centralized transparent set of information about potential projects earlier in the process next slide please thank you so this is just a list of some additional links um to project resources and we just wanted that for reference you can click on you know I think they'll be posted Zach will I think put them on the the list on the commission website as well and um next slide there's some just a few closing thoughts here you know this was a quick tour and we invite you and others to visit our online tool and report and you know we have we're really proud of the engagement that we've done and but we know there's a lot more people and organizations that could benefit from this tool and we'd love to continue to develop new new use cases and receive more feedback we have an online comment portal um so that we can consider future functionality as well um hopefully this was kind of a view of how I think you know um you can use the tool but we're happy to sit down with people and sort of train them into how to use it um I also just wanted to acknowledge that there were a lot of citing related discussions during the 2023 legislative session which I think you're going to hear more about in your later agenda um and you know it'll likely be the topic of future legislative sessions since a couple of the bills around citing didn't pass HP 2989 and HB 3180 didn't pass and um involved a lot of discussions so that might you know come up in the future I did want to briefly just mention two points from session that might lead to some updates of this tool the first is HB 3179 and that marks a major change in the regulatory jurisdiction of most large solar projects away from the process and standards of energy facility citing Council and instead using a county by county approach and this was kind of like a similar bill in the 2019 legislative session which was HB 2329 which marginally decreased the effect jurisdiction and increased County so HP 3179 decreases that fsec jurisdiction further so the thresholds for projects that are now subject to County instead of f sex jurisdiction involve different acreage um so uh the 3179 County thresholds is greater than a thousand acres to less than 240 acres for high value farmland and for solar predominantly on cultivated land it's greater than 100 acres to less than 2 560 acres and then solar and other land is greater than 320 acres to less than 3840 Acres which is about six square um and so anything above that would still go to fsec but um just just to note that there's a change there there was also um some some changes in terms of uh requirements around removing some of those facilities after their life is complete and then the last one I wanted to mention is parts of HB 3409 which was inspired by HP 3181 and a really long and robust several month conversation around energy facility citing that requires Department of land conservation and development to conduct some rulemaking on solar energy facilities and one of the directives to the rulemaking advisory committee for that provision of the law is to make recommendations for additional data that could be included in this tool in the Oregon renewable energy setting assessment tool and we're really excited to see this because our project report specifically details the data and functionality gaps that we heard from stakeholders during focus groups which we weren't able to incorporate due to the budget and scope that we had from our Federal grant so I just want to note those in closing and just say that you know if there are additional venues or events where we could provide a demo and share these new resources we'd love to attend and help people learn how to use this tool and we appreciate your time today and welcome questions thank you Richie and Wally um really great to see the good work that was done that you've done to date and to hear that there's follow-on work coming it would be I'd be interested in hearing how counties uh planning staff how they've started to use the tool and how much Outreach you've been able to do then and you know I know I tell the set of sort of data on that but I do know kind of more anecdotally that there have been some good conversations with project developers coming into the sighting Division and using the tool the staff kind of helps Orient um in that way and they they sometimes you know the size of projects change too um and then they might go into the county jurisdiction um I know that there's a couple of presentations coming up one at the infrastructure Summit that I know Wally is presenting at I think in a couple um where there are a number of planners that will be in attendance from um from counties great that's great to hear thank you um it's really tough to balance efficiency for development against all the different issues that need to be inciting so great to have tools like this and hopefully the state be able to maintain kind of a bigger picture so that the counties can see how their resources might fit into that bigger picture and this coherent away as any questions um for Ruchi or Wally oh commissary after thank you um well yeah first I want to Echo um chair McDonald's appreciation for the tool it itself um I think you know especially with renewed attention around citing particularly I feel like coming out of the inflation reduction X passage there's just you know so much conversation and needed attention around this so it's I really appreciate being able to appoint interested people and stakeholders to this tool and just having it readily available so um just yeah huge appreciation to Odo for all the work that that went into developing this um I think maybe this is a little bit more relevant to the the upcoming agenda item around legislation um but you know I think given all of the you know renewed and increasing attention around the need for Accelerated development of Renewables and transmission in order to meet our climate goals um and really maximize the benefits of recent you know Federal investments from the IRA um I'm just curious if the report findings around challenges related to renewable energy resource development and Associated transmission infrastructure does it I recognize there aren't you know recommendations or at least policy recommendations but I'm curious if the challenges identified differentiate between state and federal laws and opportunities to come those you know of course there's a pretty big uh ongoing conversation at the federal level around streamlining citing through permitting reform but just as you know this commission continues to think about advancing the road map to 2030 and leveraging federal funding um just yeah I think it would be helpful to have more clarity in terms of like what tools and actions are available at the state level and the local level but to accelerate siding of Renewables and transmission infrastructure you know thanks for the question um just two thoughts I'll mention um in part because a long time ago I worked in the federal government on that topic so I just can't help myself but um there's um there is a lot of work happening in the federal um government and it's it's hard you know there's um there's a lot of uh jurisdictional issues where you have sort of a patchwork of authorities uh land ownership that make especially transmission very difficult and you know one could ask whether the joke we had sort of was is is transmission the Christmas tree and the ornaments the renewable energy projects or you know what is the relationship there and and truly if there's not a method to go to market it's really difficult to sort of pencil out a renewable energy project and so um two two things there one is that the the layers in this tool does do include um layers and so we did we did talk with um Forest Service BLM fish and wildlife service and Incorporated data layers to provide an understanding of of those jurisdictional issues um and then the second is a gap that is detailed in the report which is there was a lot of Desire around having an understanding of the available capacity of existing transmission lines and um the way that data looks is very different than a sort of GIS layer and so we were unable to sort of incorporate um that type of data into the report instead we have a link that allows people to sort of go to other sources to see what capacity might be available if it's publicly available bonnevilles for example is um and so I think that there is some really interesting work that could happen to try to integrate that a little bit more um I also think that the sort of ongoing conversation with the federal agencies will be really important but the citing division has um you know and I think that's really focused on NEPA um as well as some of the substantive requirements that you know fish and wildlife service or other resource agencies have but the um the sort of citing process in Oregon and the land use laws in Oregon are really substantive in standards and basis so if the developer is able to you know meet that standard then they're able to sort of move forward and fsec as a sort of One-Stop kind of coordinating body for the rest of the state um requirements and so you know as we think about in the report the sort of trade-offs and you'll hear this with the energy strategy too um you know as we think about Pathways to meet our goals there may be trade-offs that require policy discussions and we didn't go into that level of detail in the report but mostly to say that we have enough renewable energy potential in this state we might not want to use it all we might want to sort of think about other resources available in other states in a more efficient way to get at those through a regional transmission organization or otherwise but sort of thinking about all of those options in a holistic way is what I think the energy strategy might help to to help lay out and I think that citing might be one of the things that are involved in that as well thank you Regine I will say that land use planning came up quite a bit during the natural the U.S climate Alliance natural and working lands learning lab in April and you know the op the need and opportunity to",

        "text": " to bring that forward, and that special use permit could be pulled. It is approved. If you are here for any of the items that we have already covered, I'm going to invite you to stay if you'd like. If not, I'll invite you to leave. And when you go out, tap somebody on the shoulder and tell them where you are sitting so they can come in and take a seat. Thank you. That being said, that's going to take us to individual considerations for 15. Good afternoon. Kenneth Odom, American County Girl Services transportation planner, item number 221105. Su. If you recall, this was brought to you on November 21 of this year. It was originally an sup that was approved one year prior to that. This is for a Alsatian and Doberman training facility under Mister Rachel Niborzabalski, canine specialists. There were a number of conditions that were applied to this particular SUP. When it was originally approved, there was notification. There was one code enforcement notification for noise only. But during the original approval, there had been public voice that indicated that there was constant noise on the property. By direction of this board, they were given one year to report back so the an assessment could be made on it. At that time, it was ascertained that they were not meeting conditions that were applied to the special use. One of which was noise. One was permitting. One was kennel licensure, another was offense. So just a second, Ken. They didn't meet the requirements of their special use permit, and this board has brought them back for revocation. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. At your direction on 1121, we were given direction growth services staff or given direction to prepare revocation to bring back for a second hearing for your consideration. So with that, I'll just give you an idea of what we have been looking at. If you remember the property. This is an a one parcel. It is rural land. This is located directly off Shady Road, south of southwest 42nd. There were a number of conditions that were originally applied to it. The three conditions, 406 and were the conditions that were not met originally by the SUP. After the November 21 meeting, staff did go out, as requested by Mister and Misses Zabalski, and met with them on site. One of the things that we did notify or looked at was basically the location of the infrastructure that they had on property. Commissioner Zalick had indicated at 1.2 on the southeastern side of the property where the shipping containers were located that they're utilizing as kennels was probably not the most appropriate location. Staff concurs with that and worked with the owners to indicate that probably a more central location would have been more adequate, as well as a more central location for training. This is basically how the area was aligned initially. This is the primary residence. They had a roaming space for the animals. Then a primary training area and the kennels were located in the lower southeast corner. One of the conditions that came out of the p and Z meeting preceding this approval was that a six foot fence was to be built on the north side of the training area and then the east side to the adjacent property. That fence was never constructed. That was discussed in the last meeting. This was the layout of the kennels as the modified containers. So with discussion with staff, Mister and Mister Zabowski indicated that this would be what they would be moving for. If they have the opportunity to be considered again, this would be a new training area. The shipping containers would be located around the existing barn. They have been utilizing the existing barn to house some of the dogs to try and mitigate some of the noise. That's over on the southeast corner. That is a little bit more of a close up of what they're proposing at this time. Staff have been by the property. At this point, I will say that Mister Zabulski has attempted to get permitting that is being held up because of this revocation hearing. He has attempted to get a kennel licensure, but that is being held up because of this revocation hearing. So Mister Zabowski and misses Zabowski are here to address the board. Okay, if we could have the applicants come forward. Welcome back. Thank you. Good to be here. Yes. Hi, my name is Rachel Zabalski. And I'm Libor Zawowski. We reside 8201 Southwest 27 Avenue, Ocala, Florida 34476. First of all, thank you for this hearing and consideration to postpone the revocation special use permit to give us another chance maybe to come to an agreement. I want to say we are also truly sorry about the misunderstanding and the requirements. A lot of things have been so we are sorry about that. Not following those requirements. We've decided, or after working with Mister Autumn and his team, that that location will be centralized. Because that came to our attention, that we should not inconvene other people's more than we inconvenient ourselves. So these ones where we went to it, we've decided that we can move those containers right by this. Already the structure have the dog runs facing to the barn. So this will also sound it as the barrier. Sound the barrier. Would it completely go away? Absolutely not. I mean, it's still. But it will definitely limit and lower the noise. We've also had an officer, county officer, who came and he measured the loudness and we were the decibels and we were right between the. Or way below, actually on legal limits of the noise. Stay still between our property, if we can show it up. It was by the road, which was hundreds yards away from Miss Jennifer House and other neighbors houses between the legal limits. We had one of the code enforcement officers accompanying us on site. And at the time that we were there, the existing horse paddock has been converted into a kennel. So I had Mister Zabowski, basically get the dogs worked up that were in that kennel. They took noise measurements approximately from this location and this location, and they were below 60 decibels, I believe. And that's still hundreds of yards away from other residential structures. You know, that new location, I hope would be found that it can be suitable. It's right in the middle of our property. Our house is the closest house to it, you know, we will have. I hope that the board will find it as a very suitable solution. Mister, could you explain to us why you did not comply with the special use requirements when you were given them? Because at that time there were changes in the department. Some people have changed, so nobody ever followed up. We knew, but I wasn't under the. Under my understanding it was that we are waiting to see if we're gonna make other neighbors happy or that was very hard to attained it, because I didn't know if that's gonna work or not. And after these. After that year when you were. It's my responsibility and I understand, and I'm truly sorry for this. I mean, it wasn't to disobey the requirements. It was that I wasn't sure that that location will stay. And investing the time and the money for this would be. No, no, no. Necessary a difference. And I get notified a week before the. Hey, we have a meeting. Do you have everything ready? There were no complaints until that point, so nothing came to my attentions. We ran it that you did not follow the request of the special use permit. Is that what I'm hearing? Nobody complains the u stayed status quo? No, no, ma'am, that's what I heard. No, I mean, that's. No. Based off of the first meeting, Mister Carl Zalek, one of his last comics, he said was to make your neighbor happy. And I know there's one primary neighbor, but we also try to communicate with other neighbors, and we want to ask him, what can we do to make this all work and to make you guys happy, and so that we could still have a business here. And the fence is more. It was more for a security issue. And the noise, I understand, is more of an environmental issue. So even with the last meeting that we had with the board of directors giving us instructions to okay, one was the fence, and that would be for the security. But as far as the NOI, there wasn't clear direction. And as far as our guidance counselor, we had a switching. We were not aware, and so we lost some communication. But. And this is our first time going through this whole process. So we want to get your advice. We want to do the right thing. We're here and we want to follow your directions for our plan. And if you have any better plan, we're more than happy to move it somewhere else. Okay, board. Do you have any comments, questions for the applicant? If I made a couple things too. We did try multiple times to contact especially Miss Jennifer, the neighbor. She was not wanting to meet with us, nor to discuss a hostile. We were trying to really reach out and work things out. But at the end we were looking for the guidance from the city, from the county to tell us instead, keep trying. Let's see if this is going to work here. Let's say it's going to go work here. Let's say it's going to go work here. And there were two. I already had them set up. And I understand in the first meeting a year ago, was discussed that it would be, I think Mister Zalig was saying much better location right by the bar and by the street. Could I move it immediately? If I would know that this is going to",

        "text": " think we're getting pretty near our time to kick off our presentations our first group is going to be a look at the bowman dam hydroelectric project that actually unfortunately was not a project and so this will be a a look at barriers and we've got um the the team of rock stars from primeval that are have been doing pretty amazing things really they greatly outperform themselves for the size of the city of primeval as far as renewable energy development goes and so we're very happy to have steve effelman who's one of our work group members but also eric klon and steve forrester is steve with us um okay got called away to the sheriff's office another meeting so sorry about that no no that's all right so i'm gonna hand it over to um eric and steve to talk about the bowman hydroelectric project i will continue to advance slides so just give me a note when you're ready for the next slide and we'll we'll kick off we'll kick this off i don't see any hands up so i think we can just jump right in rob thank you thank you for this and christy thank you for your assistance in getting this this presentation together i'm steve offline i serve on the city council for the city of prineville with me is eric klon who is the engineer for the city of craneville and was primarily primarily responsible for the oversight of the project this was a small hybrid project on bowman dam on the crooked river here in the geographic center of the state and it was actually a joint with the city of prineville with ochiko irrigation district as well as crook county and with that i'm going to turn it over to eric and hopefully we'll leave time for some questions and answers to follow eric thank you very much we'll just kind of jump into this you guys feel free to stop me with any questions this was a project we put a lot of effort into unfortunately it didn't make it through i think as we educate the public on the benefits of small projects like this you know there'll be hopefully some policy changes so i haven't given up on this project yet but um it's it's on the back burner for the time being so if we could move the slide as mr uffelman this is this project is in pretty much the geologic center of oregon so you can see where prineville's at prineville's on the crooked river that drops into the deschutes at lake billy chinook about 24 miles or so upstream from us is bowman dam bowman dam was constructed between 1960 1962 and created primeval and you can see those miles of stream above prineville reservoir next slide so what we were hoping to do this is just a graphic of bowman damn this was a very very minor project we didn't want to really modify the dam too much so currently on the left hand side of your screen you can see that is the outflow so right now in the center of the dam there's gates to release water they just lift up the gates and you go from you know high high pressure 240 feet of head to atmospheric just instantaneously so that water is just shooting out what we're going to do is just go and hook to those existing gates and put a small powerhouse just right of the current outfall next slide so there's rules in oregon related to fish passage um basically whenever you make a modification to a dam odf and w requires fish fish passage there is a waiver that can be granted for that and you essentially just have to show that there's a net benefit to your project so really the the environment's better off with your project than it would be without your project and and that's really the crux of the issue at hand next slide rob fish passage is tough i don't care where you're at it's tough to get fish to pass you know it's it's the right thing to do when you can do it the issue we have at bowman dam is historically where you have a facility with fish fish passage that upper pool so the water level in your upper upper reservoir stays pretty much at the same elevation each year and that's how you develop a fish passage bowman dm goes way way up and down you can see these graphics i mean where that surface is changing by you know 50 60 gosh this year probably 80 feet high pool to low pool and just really makes it tough for fish to get up and over that dam when your pool's going up so that passage we did an analysis of it volatile passage would have cost 138 to 250 million dollars and nobody's really figured this out yet so there was a lot of different thoughts into this but it's it's just tough nobody's been able to figure it out our total project cost was 16 million dollars so you can see that a 138 million dollar add-on was pretty difficult and you know right wrong or indifferent two steelhead and two chinook end up making it to the bowman dam in the average year next slide we put a lot of effort into this the city of frangel we try to be very proactive when it comes to the environment starting in 2009 we began developing a habitat conservation plan so that was related to the reintroduction of steelhead we wanted to make sure along with our irrigation partners that we did enough good projects that that species would be successful so since 2009 we've been working on that um 2010 the city the county the local irrigation district began working on federal legislation that was related to boatman dam in december of 2014 we actually got president obama's signature on a bill and what that did is it allowed for several things but it allowed a lot of water to go to fish and wildlife before this um no water was allocated to fish and wildlife and it also allowed us to put hydro on there that was a it was limited prior to that but four years of effort um we got our preliminary permit from ferc in 2016 our preliminary application document in and then in 2020 we started working on that fish passage waiver next slide so our project would have actually helped fish um total dissolved gas is a big issue on woman dam you have all of that pressure that pressure immediately goes to atmosphere and you basically carbonate the water what that does is it unfortunately when flows are high it kills fish they basically get blisters on their gills we're gonna put four million dollars the system of our 16 million dollar project just to fix that issue we also had some other projects related to fish health next slide please this was interesting you know working through the habitat conservation plan we've we've developed very close relationships with a lot of the different agencies us fish and wildlife and national marine fisheries so these are the guys that are actually responsible for the steelhead the salmonids they both really liked our project they pushed to see the project move forward next slide rob but at the end of the day for you know a technical reason we were where we were proposing to make some real improvements to habitat it was just those miles of stream above the project right so if somebody could figure out passage there was 464 miles available what we were doing we removed some little dams on ochaco creek and you know we made some improvements but if you look at it just from a total mileage of stream available it just wasn't enough next slide please and here's the lost opportunity this is what you guys are chatting about today you know this this facility would have generated enough power to power 1400 homes a year with clean energy you know this is base load energy which is wonderful rob just mentioned you know solar is great but we need something in the mornings and evenings project would have funded of our 16 million project 5 to 6 million of that would have been just going to fish habitat restoration and really no no negative impacts on the environment everything was positive what's unfortunate is it it wasn't able to move through so we still have that total dissolved gas issue you know the next time the crooked river is rolling fish are going to be dying you know agencies are going to be frustrated about that and we just feel this was an opportunity didn't make it through this time but as mr effelman says you know we're going to win that battle we'll either win the battle or we'll choke their rivers with our dead and he reminds me i'm a foot soldier so we got to get this one through eventually but steve do you have anything to add no i i really don't other than what we were what we were facing was presenting this and requesting a waiver of the policy for the fish passage with the oregon department of fish and wildlife uh waiver committee and they voted in a split decision to not approve and we felt i personally feel that the rigidity of the interpretation of the not giving the flexibility recognizing the benefits that we were providing i felt that what we were it was a bit overshadowed by the rigidity of of the board who of the waiver committee not approving our ability to move forward so that i have no other comments other than availability for questions you exactly nailed ten minutes like literally my timer went off as you said your last word so good modeling for everybody else thank you thank you there's a comment from dave model in the chat i don't see any other questions or hands raised right now from the members of the committee um but dave's comment is just that a usda we study from 2012 found that there was 110 megawatts of hydropower potential at non-powered dams in oregon including the one you just described well thank you well thank you and if anyone has any questions and one question just did come in thanks um so uh i'm just gonna ask this one uh it sent to me but the person asked if i could just say that just ask the question uh as damn removal moves forward on the klamath and soon on the snake um are there conversations about dam removal at um there's not don't bowman was put in one of the key or key reasons why bowman was put in was flood prevention so crooked river is really different from the deschutes that he shoots his groundwater fed and it's really pretty stable throughout the year",

She is our singer, so we won't ask her to sing for that, but we do want to wish her a very happy birthday. You're welcome. That will take us into proclamations and presentations. Second, I've got a motion by Commissioner Zalick, second by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. We are going to be around front for five proclamations and some really exciting presentations by our clerk as well. So first is our national fair housing month, and if we could invite Morgan Cardinal for the fair housing program managing attorney, community legal services of mid Florida to join us. Wonderful. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Nice to see you. We got lots of folks here for this one. Good morning. How are you? Good to see you. Everything good? Yeah. Good, good, good, good. Okay, there's our. Hey, good morning. Here we go. Sneak you over here. There we go. Okay. So, good morning, everybody. As you can see, we have a lot of people in our community that work on housing issues on a daily basis to make sure that we not only have fair housing, but affordable housing, and that we can help those who maybe need a little help in making sure that they have housing. So, thank you all for everything that you do on a daily basis to ensure housing for everyone. This is a proclamation by the board of county Commissioners of Marion County, Florida. Whereas, the Congress of the United States passed the Civil Rights act of 1968, as amended in 1988, of which title eight declared that the law of the land would now guarantee that housing throughout the United States should be made available to all citizens without regard to race, color, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or national origin. And whereas, Marion county is committed to the mission and intent of Congress to provide fair and equal housing opportunities for all, and whereas equality of opportunity for all is a fundamental policy of this nation, state, county and city, and whereas only with the cooperation, commitment, and support from all of the residents of Marion county can barriers to the enjoyment of this and the other aspects of equality of opportunity for all be removed. Now, therefore, the board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in us, do hereby proclaim that the month of April 2024 be known as National Fair Housing Month, and encourage all citizens of our community to support and endorse fair housing, reaffirm their commitment to fair housing for hall for all, and wholeheartedly recognize these rights and responsibilities throughout the year. Duly proclaim this second day of April signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by Gregory C. Harrell, our clerk of court. And with that, Morgan, I'm going to guess that you're going to be the spokesperson for this group, and I'm going to hand the mic over to you. And then who would like to hold on to the proclamation? There you go. On behalf of community legal services and all of us standing up here in an effort to ensure fair housing and affordable housing to all, I just wanted to say thank you to the board of county Commissioners. This is an important proclamation. This is an important month, and we respectfully receive this proclamation and accept this honor and encourage everybody to participate in fair housing month activities and to help us in the work that we're doing at community legal services. So thank you so much. Very good. Would anyone else like to say anything? Commissioner Stone, I know you work on some of these stuff. Would you like to say anything? No, I'm just so happy to see everybody together outside of our regular meetings. Very good. Very good. He will direct that. Very good. Absolutely great music. Thank you. You, too. Good to see you. Our next proclamation is for Community Development Week, and Cheryl Howell, we want to invite you up. The executive director for Florida Community Development association presenting is Commissioner McLean. How are you? Is this everyone? All right? I have the proclamation by the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida. Whereas the week of April 1 through 5th, 2024, has been designated as National Community Development Week to celebrate the Community Development Block grant program, and whereas, the Community Development Block grant program was enacted through the Housing and Community Development act of 1974, and whereas this program is celebrating its 50th year, providing annual funding and flexibility to local communities to provide decent, safe and affordable housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities to low and moderate income people, and whereas, the Florida Community Development association serves as Marion County's dedicated community development partner by providing invaluable opportunities for education, fostering collaboration, and facilitating networking avenues that empower organizations to contribute to the continually expanding needs of communities throughout the state of Florida. Now, therefore, the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by the virtue of the authority vested in us do hereby proclaim that April 1 through 5th, 2024, be known as National Community Development Week, and encourages all citizens of our community to support and endorse this valuable program that has made tremendous contributions to the viability of the housing stock, infrastructure, public services and the economic well being of our community. Duly proclaimed the second day of April, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by Gregory C. Harrell, our clerk of court. Would you like to say anything? Sure. Okay, thank you. On behalf of the Florida Community Development Association's board of directors, I want to say thank you. On behalf of our president, Miss Felicia Crosby Rucker. I want to say thank you. The Florida Community Development association and the CDBG program is really about creating economic opportunities, ensuring that we have fair built environments and affordable housing. And so I want to thank the board of county commissioners for all that you do every single day in that respect. Thank you. Unless you hold that one any minute, Cheryl, I do want to just put in a little plug. So Cheryl Howell is being very humble. So she used to be a Marion county employee and she used to run the CDBG program here. And I would like to say",

        "text": " point ken thank you for mentioning that i'm not seeing any other questions though i can pause for a moment to see if any typing happening but there's no hands raised okay okay go ahead rebecca uh next slide so the next study requirement is the inventory of the total hydrogen volume currently used in oregon annually next so these blocks here include the usual suspects of hydrogen consumption that in oregon we've identified uh 24 semiconductor firms that may have some manufacturing capabilities in the state and we are in continuing conversations with a number of them with our data with respect to forklifts we know through the clean fuels program that there are two facilities using hydrogen for forklifts and we know their consumption volumes there are two steel companies in oregon but one looks like it's no longer an operation and it's not clear that either of them are uh using processes that require hydrogen there is one fertilizer plant in the um and then there are other possible consumers of hydrogen that we're still identifying so i'm really glad that ken mentioned renewable diesel production um you know the red rocks facility would be included here though it's not included on this slide there's a lot of food manufacturing in oregon and hydrogenation is um a process that consumes hydrogen so we've been doing um research and outreach to determine um what if any of that consumption is happening in oregon and then we do have um some some technology hydrogen technology companies in oregon including those that produce fuel cells and electrolyzers and so there is some consumption around those and then certainly hydrogen can be used in labs as a process gas or especially in academic labs um where they are studying certain hydrogen technologies and so these are kind of the universe of potential hydrogen consumers in oregon that we have identified um and we have been um continuing outreach attempts for data gathering it has um we have been slow in uh getting this data um and as we do uh negotiate with some of these folks further data one of the potentials is an agreement in terms of how we might uh report it out so there are some concerns around confidentiality and so it's possible that um because there aren't um so many large consumers in the state that we might have to end up reporting the data out as kind of a single figure or maybe single parts of the state um it's possible that we won't be able to do it by sector uh just to maintain the confidentiality of certain um we have talked to our attack about possible methods for estimating um hydrogen consumption so for example from semiconductor manufacturing uh there may be some publicly available data that we could use to then uh estimate how much hydrogen firms in oregon uh might be consuming and then we have also had some initial conversations with hydrogen providers to see if i might be willing to provide uh data so this is an area that's ongoing and we're sorry we don't have any um data to share with you today certainly though we have it as a discussion question for later if you have there's anything in here that we um any potential end use consumption um or if you have any um you know suggestions for um any of the potential estimation or connections with some of these firms and you might be able to help us get the data by all means please let us know um rebecca it's not a pause point but there's a quick question about if you could repeat what you mean by semiconductor in this slide yes um so uh hydrogen is used in the process of semiconductor manufacturing and so we do have a number of semiconductor companies here not all of them have manufactures located in oregon some just have uh administrative offices but um especially in the uh in the hillsborough area we do have a lot of semiconductor manufacturing and so that's assumed that that's going to be a pretty big source of hydrogen consumption in oregon next slide please so the next uh requirement is an identification of potential applications of renewable hydrogen in oregon by 2030 um which we've kind of already been discussing a lot of these end uses next slide please and there's a lot of agreement in um you know the research and analyses available in terms of what are the likeliest applications of renewable hydrogen in general and kind of at what time frame and so the challenge becomes not only understanding the sensitivities that might affect these but then also how that might affect um what makes the best sense for oregon um so as mentioned renewable hydrogen can help decarbonize sectors where electrification doesn't necessarily make sense either technically or due to cost and these include sectors where hydrogen is already uh in use like we just talked about semiconductor manufacturing um there's also industrial processes and these cases renewable hydrogen can be swapped out for conventional hydrogen hydrogen without the need for any sort of special equipment essentially the only real barriers to the swap are local supply and cost and so those are a real low hanging fruit in terms of transportation is another sector where hydrogen is expected to play a role as we discussed um though certainly we are um expecting to see more uptake in the medium and heavy duty sectors and whether or not that's going to happen um in any material sense before 2030 is still an open question another application that is being discussed in the northwest is using hydrogen as a backup power replacement for diesel generators uh microsoft in specifically is investigating this for its data centers as are some other tech and the technology could also be used by hospitals and other critical infrastructure uh in fact it could be you know perhaps part of resiliency planning for uh whether or not that would be renewable hydrogen remains to be seen um though certainly for a larger facility it might make sense to have an electrolyzer on site again these are um you know really in the conceptual stage and and very you know sometimes i'm not sure if microsoft has actually moved to the pilot stage with that yet we've uh touched on briefly the need for long-duration energy storage and the role that renewable hydrogen might play there you know again whether or not that um storage um and then use in a fuel cell generate electricity or combust in a turbine to generate electricity or um you can even consider uh hydrogen injected into natural gas pipelines as a form of storage um that remains to be seen and speaking of pipelines um hydrogen can be blended into pipelines um at about a volume of up to 20 percent and numerous u.s natural gas utilities are testing this including northwest and so we expect um to see some blending in oregon um possibly by 2030 certainly northwest natural seems pretty excited about the possibility and then as mentioned earlier um you know you can either combust hydrogen in a turbine or fuel cells to generate electricity um and energy electricity generation here really refers more to a kind of as a considered generation resource as opposed to a resource to help fill balancing needs and whether or not we're going to see that renewable hydrogen play that role between now and 2030 is still a question that we're analyzing and so you see here on the left i have some of these sensitivities listed that help you know kind of frame what might affect um the different end uses of renewable hydrogen in oregon um and certainly this includes the timing and scale of production of renewable hydrogen in the region you know we don't have any production yet um of any size in oregon uh just starting to see some in washington there's a lot in if there's not local production then the costs are going to be higher the resulting carbon intensity is going to be higher and that will likely at least in the near-term depressed demand you know are we going to see some of these enabling policies you know there's been talk in the buildback better act of a production tax credit uh renewable hydrogen and that would really make a lot of projects suddenly pencil out that wouldn't otherwise um and all of these things really feeding into the cost of renewable hydrogen which is a big one that's going to address kind of which applications are picked up in what order and to what magnitude in i'll stop here for any questions sorry for the slides there um there are a couple questions in the um and we'll see why my screen is doing in a second um the first question is from um keith and he was wondering what the volume hydrogen might be needed by the semiconductor industry which i think rebecca mentioned that and that's not known right now although looking for some support and figuring that out um and rebecca feel free to add to that yep that's correct okay great and then from um janine she was wondering about whether there were some end use cases for wood product manufacturing and then kathy also was wondering whether because oregon has some seaports whether hydrogen was being considered for fuel for ships and barges yes so uh when we talk about heavy-duty transportation um to other um you know there's on-road transportation there's kind of off-road vehicles that can be used at ports and on farms uh and then there's marine and aviation and there's certainly an that uh hydrogen um of some flavor is gonna play a role in fueling marine and aviation vehicles um you know kind of in in aviation it's more likely that hydrogen would then be um transformed into you know ammonia or another fuel um that's you know easier to store um with marine there are some prototype vehicles um out there vessels out there certainly washington is looking at the opportunity for hydrogen fuel cell powered fairies it seems a little longer uh down the time frame um but then also there is the opportunity of renewable hydrogen for export and so and renewable hydrogen are are markets that are growing globally and so there's certainly that possibility of you know if there were excess uh renewable hydrogen produced in the northwest that this could be a very valuable commodity uh to ship over to asia we don't really touch too much on that in the in the study um but to some degree great and then a question from jason you gas plants are not allowed in oregon um it's referring to a recent bill passed hp 2021 hydrogen plants are allowed so is blending allowed for new plants and jessica was asking for confirmation on whether blending with conventional fuels was the question we didn't hear it yeah i'm gonna assume that there that jason's asking about blending with natural gas and you know that that's a great question um that is you know one of the challenges of uh incorporating renewable hydrogen is going to be you know figuring out the answers to some of these questions eligibility and citing um janine offered that she heard that there's some investigation into using hydrogen at",

        "text": " the United States from this region from Europe from Canada from Asia they come from all over so this organization is kind of like a conglomerate of a lot of different countries is that right or is it just South Korea the pairing company itself is just South Korea okay uh they do have companies elsewhere in the united in the world for various um and just maybe this doesn't answer your question but hopefully it adds some um one of the things I touched on when I presented is that we're vertically um and our panels are actually made in the United States there are not many manufacturers who have factories in the United States there is probably less than 10 in the United States to actually build their panels here um and so yes we are a South Korean um well at least our parent company is but they're heavily invested into the United States okay and I have been to South Korea I love South Korea I have nothing against South Korea um it's just that I would like to see Americans working and um I don't support this at all it's going to be ugly it's going to take the Farmland which I'm not obviously there's been so many comments here I'm not familiar with all this stuff I'm learning it too um but and just to reiterate this is the very very beginning of our process okay we're not close to a decision we don't have an application yet this is just the notice of intent it's sort of okay so I have another town hall like this somewhere else somewhere somewhere else in a bigger location Albany yes I understand a bigger facility yeah Jack in Albany in Lebanon I you know in yeah I know that it is here but there are people that have yeah our requirement is so we'll have a we have this is a public information meeting on the notice of intent we will have a public information meeting on the complete application and then a public um all of those require us to be in person in proximity right so it doesn't say exactly what that means in our our rules but we want to be you know reasonably close so people can participate so you know again as I said earlier yeah we'll we'll seek input on a better location okay yeah the turnout is great I really thank everybody for turning out I was really scared nobody was going to show up was I wrong oh and here's mayor Craven okay thank you so much okay Miss Hagerty thank you for your patience I appreciate it um Miss Haggerty you're next and then up after misogrty is Kim buzzard my name is Stephanie glaser-haggerty and for the record my family's covered wagon is in the Linn County Historical Museum I've been farming for a very long time I agree with and appreciate I agree with and appreciate the ladies and gentlemen that spoke before me addressing comments concerns and where policy may not have been followed as we as residents of this area understand it I have two questions one of them is more of a statement followed by a question KGW the Portland news station did a nice um Dr Higgins research at OSU and then they ended the segment with saying this was really a very big experiment I'm wondering how big you think your projects experiment really is and what the impact to our community might be as an experiment of this magnitude I'm also familiar with cultural studies and I'm wondering which jurisdiction you follow when you're doing your cultural study thank you so so let me let me get the cultural one first and then you can kind of respond um so we have a historic and cultural and archaeological resources uh requirement and we work with the state historic preservation office um so early on in the process you know you saw that uh the diagram with the kind of the bullet shape so again within the site boundary they have to do an evaluation and then based upon um you know working with the state historic preservation office you know how much farther out do they have to go I mean based upon literature survey it's the state historic preservation office that determines you know is there likelihood for you know subsurface resources or are there any known you know resources out there and the protocols that they established are then what the applicant has to follow so does that mean that they have to go through and do subsurface probes within you know a transect in certain distances that all gets established by the state historic preservation office so and then they're obligated they will hire they don't already have one you know an archaeological consultant to do the work consistent with that we will review that in consultation with the state historic preservation office to make sure that that's all done correctly and sorry that's all evaluated or open for public um you know later on down the road as well thank you so to address the question about uh agrawal takes with sheep grazing um I'd like to put it out there that there's not a lot that needs to be modified in a solar field uh to accommodate sheep um there might be some minor tweaks to the design to accommodate for it uh just like you know tiny up the cables to make sure that they don't get stuck or adding protection around the pile so they don't again don't get stuck or anything of that nature outside of that the feed mix does actually have to be specified by someone who smarter than me that knows more about sheep than I do um and if this were like a normal solar project then we would just plant a native a native seed mix of low to medium growth but this particular one we'd be doing something that's more favorable for sheep as an experience I mean experiment I mean I had to I had to rely on people who've done the research on this persons that work at UH who are at Orange uh OSU or other universities fit in talks with persons from different states who also uh study the subject matter and you know I'm not going to be claiming to be an expert on agribulletics or she or any of that nature so I had to rely on them but again even if this is if let's just say the Sheep doesn't work out we've already heard comments about that so that would be something that during the f-sec process we would have to consider and there would be backups for that as to what they would be that's something that I would assume that uh fsec would have to kind of so would that be a second segment of an experiment then no if what you do for a noxious weed abatement which is to be mo the uh mow the grass or mow the crop cut I mean the cover um so if that were to be an alternative that is suitable um then that would be it and that would just be standard practice for a normal solar site so then you're saying that you're really working with an organic site if you're if you're Mowing and you're not applying any kind of pesticide for or herbicide for weed o m is not my specialty but what I know from what I talk to are like maintenance persons or asset management team is that they mow the site they physically know the site they don't I'm not sure if they spray anything so I don't want to comment on that um but I know that for a fact that they do mow the sites thank you so just just one kind of response on there we have no requirement that they're they do agricults that is not any way shape or form a requirement that we have however if as part of their application to meet the land use standard because they're going to be taking a certain amount of uh acreage out of production if they use that information to justify we're going to do this and this is sort of the um our way of midi attacks sorry let's read some feedback okay now no feedback on that one so if they do that and we rely upon that um as a way to say okay with this you meet the standard that is an obligation on their part so they don't have any opportunity to say sorry didn't work out with the Sheep we're good then there would have to be some backup plan and again that will be the information that's important for you the public to be saying okay do we think with this additional you know agroval tanks or whatever else they're proposing it meets it but you have concerns we want to hear that because that will be enough that would be an obligation if they propose it and we rely upon that they would be obligated to continue to have some sort of agrovoltaic aspect like I said that is not a requirement for us but if they use that and we rely upon it we have and I have not mentioned this in the past or you know prior we have a full compliance program we have two full-time people that do compliance we don't just do the application process and then 40 years later um you know what's going on we come out on the site on a yearly basis to make sure that it's being operated during construction we come out several times to make sure that it's being constructed properly if we get calls from people you know that there can concerned that the project is not being either built or operated consistent with the approvals we have a compliance program to ensure that we hold them accountable so that's something to be tracking throughout this thank you Frank okay so Kim Kim buzzard and then John marble is next hi my name is Kim my comments are not tied to standards I am not an expert but I am a person and I'm representing the neighbors and I feel that my views are important what this keeps um we're calling this a park or a facility and in my opinion that does not belong on Farmland the farm the definition of a farm is an area of land and its buildings used for growing crops and rearing animals typically under the control of one owner or manager in my opinion solar panels have nothing to do with crops or animals this property is a zoned exclusive Farm use and it is that for a reason why ruin disrupt disturb high value soil I would urge you to please take your facility panels metal industrial equipment to a place where it will not ruin the aesthetic value of someone else's property we live directly across the road it's just ever so slightly to the South many of these neighbors also would look upon this this is not where we Cho what we chose for our place to live my grandfather purchased the ranch that my dad and mom gave us property to live on in 1943. we would like to give it to our children and not have a large portion of our view disrupted and Disturbed and there is value in that I don't know how",

opportunity especially here um near near phoenix to actually provide uh high-end jobs is the uh is the goal there in terms of campus style type uh development and anyway so i'm just i'm just kind of giving you kind of that perspective that may be a little bit different than the conversation we're having today but it's certainly i think important to know and has had an impact on our ability to rebuild so thank you so much for sharing eric um we did get a question asking what role you have or like what it's you said you're from phoenix we're just somebody else i'm sorry i'm uh i'm the city manager oh you're the city manager yeah yeah i'm sorry oh no worries no i wouldn't have i wouldn't have necessarily asked but somebody else wanted to know so thanks so much for sharing it right yeah well that's that's how i kind of have a little bit of a insight into the whole ugb process hey eric the network properties so it looks like alan um zelenka on our team wants to respond to something that you said so go ahead allen talk a little bit more about those um that large mobile home park that you had you said it was like 200 and owned by a large they provide the manufactured homes or they just lease the slots or can you talk a little bit more about that yeah so it's a company they're out of utah um and i i don't have the name right off the top my head but basically uh the answer is yes they provide they own the lots they lease the lots they have requirements uh for you know i think that to place uh the mobile homes on the lots and then i think at some point too they'll even sell you the i think i think their first priority is uh is being able to get you to buy one of their units and then and then you lease the spot it has a clubhouse it's got you know it was built if i have an older community before and now i think they've opened up to all ages so and they're rebuilding it yeah yeah well that's the plan i mean you know we're working through a lot of you can imagine it's uh got some floodplain issues and all sorts of things going on um yeah and but you can bring in your own manufactured home right um i don't think so i don't think that's the idea um okay but it there are parts that um i'll have to get back to you on that but i i i there are parts that are allowing you to bring them in but they also have certain requirements age and those kind of things right right yeah the manufactured home part of this is really complicated and very difficult to get at um so we'll we'll be in touch with you and get more data about that maybe we can get in touch with those that company and work with them directly to get some energy-efficient manufactured homes or retrofit heat pumps and work directly with that agency or with that company that sounds great uh and a guy by name of joe slaughter is our economic and community development director he's also more directly involved but between the two of us we can certainly get you the the info for sure yeah joe was at another of our meetings last week i believe so great to have the city of phoenix here and eric one other note is you were concerned about business structures um our particular incentive for energy efficiency does include business structures just so you know okay i thought i misunders sorry i misunderstood that i thought we were focusing on residential but good to hear well i mean the focus kind of is residential because most of what was lost was residential but we do have a commercial the commercial and multi-family um are kind of melded together into one incentive it's there yeah that's because there were 250 commercial and multi-family structures and 5 000 residences yeah all right well thanks so much eric we've appreciated hearing from you today and hopefully we'll get a chance to talk um does anybody else have any comments questions concerns it looks like maybe some no nothing new in the q a for me it's gonna sit in awkward silence until somebody raises their hand i think i don't see anything new coming up here maybe you know a little conversation one of the things we're struggling with getting incentives out to low to moderate income people the low income people that's kind of easy if you're in one of these programs and you can prove it then you can you can get an incentive people above that that are that kind of low moderate income people above that we're struggling with trying to find a an effective efficient easy way to verify whether or not you are a moderate low to moderate income person low incomes is easier but the if anybody's got any ideas or had any experience with other programs where that moderate income component was part of it we'd certainly like to hear from you as as michael said in the slides you certainly want to hear about how that's been done other places to make it as easy and effective as and while we'll wait on that i guess i'll add based on eric's comments uh the concerns around you know housing affordability we certainly recognize that there was some housing shortage already in the phoenix talent area and we certainly received feedback of that and obviously the wildfires didn't help that at all uh and exacerbated that program or that problem and we've worked with housing community services and we'll continue to do so i know they're focused on on figuring out how they can some add some affordable housing uh i know they've ordered i believe it's 150 modular units they're going to introduce within that community and give to jackson county housing authority to kind of distribute over the next year and i know they're they're looking at other ways to kind of try to get to more multi-family structures within that region and so we can certainly help make connections between housing community services if there's some work that they're already doing and we can point you to some of those resources unfortunately we're kind of limited by energy efficiency so we can kind of be at the fringes of some of those discussions but certainly i think housing community services is going to be leading a lot of those discussions and i know they are in conversations with a lot of the manufacturing dealers as well as park owners uh and working on with community owned park owner park owners as well as privately owned park owners and so we can try to make some connections if that's helpful um but you're certainly right eric uh i think you know you pointed out a variety of different issues that kind of intermingled uh and it's hard to untangle them at some point we have to kind of it stresses the the point of we have to work together with local jurisdictions as well as all the state agencies to come up with solutions and work together thanks michael and we're not we don't have any of their hands up nobody had a particular response to alan so i think it's a trick for everyone figuring out how to handle the moderate income side um one thing that i'll flag for folks on the call since we do have so many folks from southern oregon is we have a portal open for comments we'll follow up um with an email from this that will include a link to it but also know that i'm going to be sending around to some folks down in the community some flyers that are bilingual to direct people to that portal and the portal can be translated into spanish and other languages so i just wanted to flag i know at least one of you is expecting it i'm waiting to get our translation proof read which is supposed to happen today so i'll get that um to you all hopefully tomorrow and then that'll be open for two weeks for for more feedback um kind of meant for we we get on these calls a lot of people who work sort of professionally um in this in this issue they there are like jenna trying to rebuild um from a business perspective or we have a city manager um but this is meant to also be shared with folks that um are survivors that are rebuilding so thank you for thank you for spreading that around and we'll try to maybe tack it on to the reminder the follow-up email that so people can share it around too thanks all right i guess while we're waiting for more questions maybe i'll i'll just kind of show these resources what you're just highlighting christy and we will follow up with an email with this information so please don't feel the need to write it down right now but we do have an incentive program page on our website you got a variety of about what our program looks like uh the administrative rules activity is basically following our rulemaking and what it's going to look like you can sign up for email updates and kind of track how things are going uh you can email us directly the email i will send out will be from me and so you can reply to just send me an email directly or send it to this general email address and then i i mentioned dcbs's wildfire hardening program and i encourage people to take a look at that program as well it's going to be a sister program that is going to be offering incentives for people rebuilding uh to encourage them to incorporate fire hardening when they and so here is the link to the portal that um kirsty was just highlighting and just want to mention that there is a deadline of feedback but it's still far out plenty plenty of time to provide feedback and this would just be another phase of feedback so you provide feedback now and then we'll create draft rules and there'll be another public comment period in january so you haven't completely missed out but the earlier you can get us feedback the earlier we can incorporate it and fit it into total program design and make sure we're meeting people's needs any other questions christy or feedback i don't see anything else i'm happy to stay on the line as we let people go and if anybody wants to raise their hand and ask any questions on the way out feel free work out till five i suppose or until you all leave but we can just hang out and if anybody has any questions the q a or raise your hand otherwise i think we can call it if you'd like thank you everybody for your time thank you for making time to talk to us and provide us feedback it's very valuable um this

        "text": " action plan uh translated into the application that we uh submitted I should I should say we submitted that at the very end of last month it was due uh 1st um next slide okay this is U just a roll up of those measures wanting um highlight uh both the uh emission reduction measures that uh cumulatively uh uh are our estimate of what would be what will be achieved if we are able to successfully fund and Implement those measures with this Grant application um and it's I say to my eye this is this is really exciting I and significant for Oregon uh looking at well over six million tons of uh CO2 equivalent uh reduction across those those three areas that I just mentioned um and uh right there in the middle at the bottom row you can see the total amount that we have applied to EPA for is just under uh $200 million so a really significant uh amount of funding uh potentially we hope uh that will come to Oregon to implement these these measures and also I I think really important for us and for EPA uh are the um the effectiveness the efficiency with which we can put those dollars to work and what that's what you see there on the right hand two columns uh of course as you'd expect these being the cost per ton of uh emissions reduced and when we look at over just that near- term just the next uh about 5 years um the cost per ton of production as you would expect is higher at about $159 than uh per ton than when you look out over the entirety of the um uh effect of these measures uh out through 2050 where we think we have a a pretty darn competitive uh uh emission reduction or cost per ton um of abatement there uh at sitting at on average $3 per ton uh and Amy did is there one more slide did you add another slide at the end of this for us to conclude on or just leave up with for questions yes there is another slide it's put in there mostly for the commission's reference if you'd like to go back and see how much money we've requested and what our estimated emissions reductions are for each of the individual measures in our application um please feel free to reference this slide yeah thank you for adding that and again we since we walked through this in some detail last time i' I've glossed over I think we just had 10 minutes for this so I should probably leave it there Kathy I don't want to take any more of your agenda but I don't know if you want to Applause for thr questions or just roll on into the next agenda item when do you anticipate hearing from um back from EPA did they give you any kind of a window of time they did yes fortunately I I would say they're holding themselves uh to a similarly aggressive timeline as they've held the rest of us up to this point uh they intend to get back back um this summer uh to applicants and with a initial determination of of of who's going to get what um I don't know if we know the month Amy was there did they say I feel like they did say a month it was either June or July uh yeah I believe they said June or July but that it wasn't 100% definite yeah yeah they're not holding themselves to a a date certain like they did the rest of us of course they have to give us all specific deadline they they haven't given us a date but a time frame yes chair I know you're how hard uh staff have been working on this so congratulations on getting it done I'm sure that was a big weight off your shoulders and um it's really exciting to to think about what um what might come from this Grant application it was one of the overarching recommendations um that we had uh for this State as part of our road map of uh making sure that the state was positioning itself to um take advantage of all the federal Investments that are being made as part of um a couple of uh bills that were recently passed so it's great to see um you doing just that and exciting to to see what we um can do with the funding uh if we are fortunate enough to get one of these grants so congratulations thank you chair and I should actually appreciate back to this commission uh your your past work uh really put us in a solid a much better position than we would have been otherwise to be responsive to the many many different ways that EPA asked for uh reporting out on information and metrics um have the work of this commission really did help inform and put us in a really competitive I think I hope position to respond this solicitation that's great that's good to hear thank you any other uh questions for Colin y chairman Donald I have a question great uh in again want to just continue appreciating you all for the many many many hours of work that I know went into making this application as competitive as possible um I think uh the the state should feel very proud of um just what a robust and comprehensive uh proposal attuned to the the requirements and parameters of this opportunity um that ended up being submitted so thank you again um I you know I I think I I just wanted to ask um a question around the comp itiveness of this particular Grant opportunity I think I had heard that there were somewhere around hundred billion doll in total requests Nationwide out of a $4.6 billion doll pot that I maybe that's off but I I think the point is there um that was more funding requests uh submitted then there is funding available which is you know typical for this kind of competitive opportunity but maybe more so for this particular pot so uh my question is if uh you all see any opportunity or role for members of this commission or um other interested uh stakeholders to help at this phase to increase the competitiveness of Oregon's application um I know many of us were you know working to do that prior to the application sub submission but any anything else that we can do um at at phase that's a that's a good question appreciate that commissioner after um I think even in post application uh EPA will take receipt of uh letters of support uh if organizations if if me members of this commission and your organizations that you you represent wish to provide a letter of support uh you I don't know how much that affects or you uh the epa's decision but they they are certainly they able to and are receiving uh those put in this post um that is that is the only thing that really Springs to my mind as far as opportunities at this juncture um you know they're kind of it's a lot like if anyone's familiar with a how the a job application process for public government it tends to work once once the application are window is closed the the agency uh you know is not able to receive more information from us so they ask us questions and get clarification there it's what we what we sent is what they are going to consider um outside of again uh letters of support uh and and I truly don't know how much that um affects decision- making there on their end I think it'd be great if we wrote a a letter of support as of the commission even they can't officially consider it it still would like to to support what you guys have all done yeah chair McDonald I I would greatly appreciate that I think I mean it it can only help right at least I yeah and is the Brant application uh posted anywhere on deq's website it is and we should have included a slide there uh with that with a link to that I will follow up we have a um dedicated web page on cprg U and now have a link to the full application uh as well as past information again that priority climate action plan that directly informed this application uh if you look at the two you can really see that plan mirrored in our application and I I I I emphasized that in this presentation just I I we're pretty proud frankly of of how we've run on this process as far as being again responsive to EPA we we know better I think what our own priorities are and that's and there's a lot of overlap not don't mistake that but but nonetheless really designing this process in response to how EPA is running the climate pollution reduction Grant uh program and so you you'll see that on the web page and uh Amy you know you know the the the link I don't need to share that with you so I don't know how you want to share that out to the commission I shared it out through the chat and Nora shared it out as as well oh okay great thank you both sorry after um I just wanted to add one other comment and I I think maybe we over time but um you know while Kathy Sorge I completely agree I would love to help support um an additional letter on behalf of the commission into EPA and support of the states application um and uh well I know we're all eager and hop that the grant you know maximum amount of funding will be approved um for the proposed activities under the state's application I would um encourage uh us and and the state agencies to consider um based on what does end up being approved um if there are you know because of all the great work you've already done I would hate for that to go to way so if there are other Federal opportunities that we can look out for or you know as the state of shaping future budgets if there is a a opportunity to use this application and and all the great work that has gone into it to help guide future you know either Federal funding proposals or state funding decisions I think um just want to make sure that it continues to serve as as a um guiding uh proposal for for future funding opportunities thank you again Colin for presenting on this and um I will go ahead and work with staff to draft a letter and um Nora if you'd like to uh review that uh and help with that I'd love to have you um join join me in in drafting a letter so would be great I also wanted to recognize that um commissioner palowski uh is with us um Senator demro joined us uh Senator Jax EXC EXC me Senator Jackson now that's a that's a nice addition commissioner Jackson um I think I believe has joined us and if there other Commissioners who joined us a little late after we did the roll call feel free hey great well thank you um and representative Marsh we're so honored uh to have you join us today um and talk",

        "text": ". So that everybody's expectations are clear. Outline what you expect. Yeah. And when he comes back with his master plan, I'm sure that will be in agreement if it's, like, the best. I'm expecting not to get through master plan if I don't. That's how this turned out. I mean, so it's. It's no longer quasi judicial. I can sit down with commissioners, Alec, to work through those issues after the zoning is. Is approved. Thank you, sir. Okay. Any further discussion? All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you. And that last part was my legal opinion. You might want to reach to the actual attorney for that. I'm making a note of that so that you know how to guide everybody in the future. High index of Tillman legal opinions. Next item on our agenda to cover this afternoon is item one, item number 24. So, one, we'll take that one. And probably simultaneously we'll be looking at 240410 ZC. Can wear our grow services. As you mentioned, this is a small scale land use amendment and a concurrent zoning change. This is item twenty four, s zero one. The applicant is Aldana contracting, and the property is located on Highway 44, east of I 75, just west of Highway 475. The property size is 5.39 acres and it is a comprehensive plan use amendment request to change from public land use to commercial. The current current land use is public. So what? In 2005, this property was part of a takings that happened for the where the state took it for the 484 widening, and then in 20. And it was at that time it was rural land. And in 2013, there was a comprehensive plan update amendment that changed any land that was owned by the county or by the state to public. So that's why it has a public land use. Sometime later, the state decided to sell it off because they did not need it. They put the DRA in this section and they left 5.39 acres surrounding that DRA. We do not have a reverter clause where if public land use is sold to the public, that it reverts to what it was. And we have this issue. So, you know, it rises from time to time. And we asked the applicants to go through a land use amendment. For the most part, property is zoned a one, so they could build a home or develop it as a one today because of the intent of a one that says it can be developed as a one if it has a different land use. But the proposal is for that 5.39 acres to be commercial. It is outside of the urban growth boundary, and it is in the secondary Springs protection zone. It is in the rural area between highway I 75 and or interstate I 75 and Bellevue on 484. And there is a rack or activity center about fifteen hundred feet to the east of this. That is, we will get into that. It is not fully developed. It does have some development in the southwest quadrant and to the east of this or to the west of this. I apologize. There's a strip of commercial that goes. There's a driveway, and there's two driveways between this parcel and the strip commercial to the west. And that strip commercial goes all the way to South Magnolia Avenue. So we're looking at the land use amendments. The. This property right here is the old true value hardware store that's been there for at least 30 years or more. And then over time, in 2001, 2000, 520 21 and 2022 parcels have come in, gotten a land use amendment to go commercial there. And then to the east, there's some legacy commercial zoning on rural land use. And then the rack with the heavy outline. Here's the zoning changes that coincide with the land use amendments. This port parcel right here, it is rural commercial, and it has the. That is the one with the church on it and looking at the rack to the east, showing what has been developed there. So we have a learning center with a barber shop and a jiu jitsu place. There's a grocery store, a church with a house, auto repair, gas station, hay sales, and a veterinarian. But then a nursery to the northeast, and the rest of it is largely vacant. So we are recommending denial of the land use amendment to commercial because our comprehensive plan policy, one, 1.7, discourages strip commercial. And we have that strip commercial to the east or to the west of this parcel, and we're requesting that we not extend that any further. Our office of the county Engineer, their traffic department, has. Traffic division had recommended denial due to the 55 miles an hour speed limit, not knowing what would be developed there. The applicant says they want to do storage warehouses, but it's b, five straight zoning. Any permitted use could be developed there. When it comes to site planning, can you bring your map back up real quick? Yes, ma'am. That makes more sense. Okay. And then for access here, you can only go to the east. If you were to try to go west, you have to make a U turn on highway 44. And then we have policy three, 1.4 rural areas outside of the urban growth boundary. We believe that this land use amendment request is in conflict with that policy as well. So overall, for the land use amendment, we find that it will affect the public interest. It is inconsistent with chapter 163, the Florida state statutes, and inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and incompatible with the surrounding area, with the exception of that strip commercial to the west. And all of those parcels have their own individual driveways because they were done piecemeal. Absolutely. Go ahead, commissioner. So can you go back over the comprehensive plan policy? Why? It's. Okay. So which one exactly? The rural areas. What is it? The 314, right. 3.1.4. Yeah. So this is the rural areas outside of the urban growth boundary where the intent is to protect the existing rural areas in question, character of the area, and acknowledge that the certain portion of the county's population will desire to live in a rural setting to promote and foster and continue the continued operation of agricultural activities, farms and other related uses, and generate employment opportunities in the rural areas, or that generate employment opportunities to establish a framework for the appropriate future opportunities and development options. So, ken, is it. I mean, I understand a lot of the verbiage you're using, but is it mostly because, you know, in the rural lands, I mean, our strategy is the rack. Yes. For commerce. Correct. And some of those parcels that are strip commercial to the west are vacant. And then we have a lot. We have various areas, either over by the interstate in Bellevue and in the urban growth boundary that are vacant, entitled commercial properties where you can do storage warehouse uses. Today we have ample of that in this area. We have a. It's a fairly rural area, or it's a rural area on a high speed arterial road. And we're putting more commercial. You know, there's not a demand for more commercial out there. It's just somebody owns property and they want to convert it. So part of the problem from traffic's perspective is that because, I mean, listen, we know all the problems on 484, not in this particular section right here, but the more driveways we continue to put on it without interconnection. Correct. There's. Is that what engineering said? There's two issues that they have. One is they don't know what the end use is going to be, so you won't know what the total traffic generation is. And two, you do not have the ability for cross access here because of theirs. You can't do cross access on this property. No, no, sir. Because there's two driveways right here that are not commercial. Oh, and so you can. And these parcels here, I don't believe there's much cross access between those either. They all have their own individual driveway. That's going to be a problem in general later on, but yes. And then you're saying the problem also is that going to a straight b five without understanding the use, then b five can get rather intense. Right. Because it allows for anything between one b one, b two, b four and b five. But it also has some very intense uses in it as well. Okay. So it can be either intense traffic generation or intense like the actual use, the noise and pollution. So even if that's not the intent today. It's going to still end up being v five in the future. Correct. Because, you know, they could get the conversion to be five and then realize it's worth much more doing something else and then apply to do that. Thank you, sir. Thank you. It is. Well, it's a one at the moment, so I know. Do we have any more questions for staff at the moment? What was the. Go ahead? Yeah, go ahead. Commissioner PNZ approved at 65. The. They viewed the strip commercial to the west, saying that that helped make it compatible, and they did not see this as a problem for the overall area. And then we have the concurrent zoning change. So we currently. The property is a one with the public land use. As we went over, they're requesting b five zoning, which is our heaviest commercial. And it does allow for storage warehouses. I did check that. That is the one of the b's that allows",

Jim Edon adviser to new buildings Institute thanks Jim okay that covers all the introductions so now we can move forward on the agenda and uh since I sent out the agenda I actually made um a couple minor updates um one of them I added an item just to to talk over just based on some feedback um from one of the one of the rack members to just add like a general BPS program schedule um to the agenda I think maybe in one of the past in our kickoff meeting we kind of showed a chart of how we plan to move through each of one of the rulemaking sections um so we'll we'll just kind of bring that up again to to highlight the different tasks really that we expect to go through as a as a committee and as an agency this year um and then the overall BPS kind of program schedule as a whole Tu Le into future compliance dates um so I added that item on the agenda um but where I wanted to start with um well I guess first I'll ask does anybody have any proposed like additions to the agenda or or changes okay not hearing any but um you know certainly feel free to to weigh in um later on too as we go through but first I just wanted to follow up with the rack Charter so in the in our first meeting our kickoff meeting we presented a charter for this group um and we put it out for comment for rack members thank you very much to for review and for comments so what I did um was pretty much go through and um and accept all the pretty much all the proposed changes um so what I'm showing right now on the screen is the comments that we received um and then with the the changes that were made to address those comments so there was one comment about um you know consent decision- making um you know what does that mean would it be helpful necessary to show like if there's Clarity to know when things can move forward if there's some sort of like a majority need so I just added one clarification about like how Odo is like seeking majority consensus with from the rack as we move forward with our rules but one thing that we do need to keep in mind as an agency is just about our our delegation of authority you know as the um responsible Agency for administering building performance standards and the nature of the the rack being an advisory committee in nature without necessarily having the like authority over moving forward it's you know not not quite similar to like a board or another um like oversight entity as far as like moving forward with the with the rules so that's one thing we wanted to to clarify um although through this process we will certainly make every effort to achieve kind of majority consensus with with our rules as we move as we move forward so um there was a question about um the the process for bringing proposed rules to the rack uh for and then um you know making hearing rack comments oh uh Kevin looks like you have a question before Oh and and herea does too so mine is just that Anna is uh has arrived and so might want to have um them introduce themselves oh thank you um Ani if you're there and want to provide just a quick introduction um hi everyone uh sorry I'm late I was at a doctor's appointment so I apologize about that um my name is an Rodriguez I am the energy Justice coordinator um and I use she her pronouns thank you all sorry for the interruption andar I appreciate you no problem at all thanks for joining and Vin too I see Vin's Vin's joined if you want to do quick introduction yeah hi everyone Vin Mas with the city of Portland I been managing the commercial manag reporting program here since 2015 um I'm actually having a lot of issues with webx I've been trying to get on by my phone too but doesn't have audio so I can't figure out I've lost any way to control my muting so be quiet in the background thanks um and yeah thanks V Uh Kevin Dell do you have a comment or a question we can't hear you if you're talking all right I clicked the wrong there uh Curious what is the definition of majority consensus because to my mind either or you have a majority in other words I think that's obvious or you have a consensus which means everyone agrees that's a good yeah that's a good point so I think what I think what I was trying to go for here was like a majority um and maybe taking the consensus off there you know I ideally we'd achieve consensus on everything although you know I imagine there will be cases where that's just not possible um sure I mean I I think the the original language was fine a consensus is desired but not necessary if there's not a consensus I presume there's a majority you know yeah I think just to clarify my suggestion here like consent just means people may not be you know in favor but they may agree and be okay with it and so that's just it's sort of a maybe a maybe a little too much minutia but that's just sort of a clarification that that's a consent is sort of helpful in clarifying yeah thanks Kathleen so would it be should I should we remove go or just go back to the way we had it initially I leave that up to Kathleen yeah I think it's fine just leave it the way it is yeah okay thanks got it yeah um great apprciate I just had to change my view there okay um then the next comment that we had on the um Charter was just around the the process for the kind of phased iterative approach where we bring Draft rules to the rul making advisory committee receive comment make changes um as needed and then go out for broader public review on that same set of rules or that same section of the rules um so I just added a sentence to clarify that it's going to be a phase iterative process as we go through that multiple times um with every with every section rules uh there was a just a general question around will committee members have the opportunity to weigh in on the public comment period and the potential influence modification to the rules or is it just um Odo and so the answer there is uh yes um you know definitely I think we we do want um you know I I the way that I see it happening is that the the rack would have like the early review for the proposed rules we put it out for the public um and then we'll bring those comments back and Odo will review the comments and then we can also bring those comments to the rack too um for for weighing in on how to address so and certainly welcome rack member comments through the public process too um as a as a separate um if if needed you know a separate opportunity to provide comments but you know definitely want to have that multiple iterative step process through as we go through um and then I think the really only other uh there was an addition about you know committing you know to to provide reasonable access to any underlying data that we have to support summaries reports and determinations so we added that one in there um and then there was also some comments around we had initially proposed just to make have rack meetings focused with rack members but there was some desire to have it um open to public members too so we were um okay with that so we we've gone ahead and just made that",

        "text": " so i don't have a particular project in mind but but something that's doable um administratively i guess for smaller would be something that i had in mind yeah we're really happy to have some representatives along the coastal with us today and we recognize that the coast is kind of unique in that it has yet one additional natural disaster on top of all of the other ones that could potentially happen in oregon with tsunamis and so we recognize coastal communities as being very strategic partners in this program and with that said i think it's a good um good time to introduce shannon souza with soulcoast um i'm shannon i'm talking to you from another one of those coastal communities let's see i've got four hats i'm wearing since 2003 i've had a solar contracting and consulting business so both doing the assessment feasibility and the contracting down here i'm the executive director for a new non-profit oregon coast energy alliance network that's specifically focusing on clean secure energy for coastal i'm the policy director for pacific ocean energy trust so speaking of turbines those would be the floating offshore wind turbines and i'm the policy chair as a volunteer for oregon's solar and storage industry in terms of um i have a lot of projects in mind one that's really interesting to me right now is looking at the coquille valley hospital which is interesting because it's out of the tsunami zone it may still be after a 9.0 it's definitely rural definitely hits the low income and i'm really interested in how far along electrolysis and fuel cell technology has come and what's already being deployed over in europe successfully so i'm thinking about that the project design and feasibility funds and i'm hoping that somewhere in the suite we have the opportunity as a state to look at some of this newly emerging technology for its applicability and then of course for the the contracted funds we have a whole suite of tribal centers and hospitals and water treatment systems that would love to see some straight up traditional solar and storage um or maybe some fuel cells there as well thanks rob all right thanks shannon it's a great uh great to have you on this team and um seems like you are often on teams so i'm really happy that you um took your busy schedule and made us part of it because i know you wear a lot of hats and uh you lend a lot of support to a lot of different groups so thank you for joining us moving on for a reset representative from a federally recognized oregon tribe um danny martinez and i don't actually see danny's name on the list but danny are you with us all right it may be that we get danny later in the meeting and if that happens we can get him to share his ideas at that time and so we will we'll ping him and see if we can get danny to join us i know it's busy times and for a lot of us so moving on um the bill asks us have three representatives of local representing counties sittings cities and special districts and i know that phil chang deschutes county commissioner was going to be traveling for the first part of this meeting and perhaps calling in i don't know if phil is able to join us with an audio right now or not but phil are you with us all right well i do think we will have an opportunity to speak with commissioner chang um later in the meeting i know that he let me know that he was going to be on the road for the first part of the meeting so next on the list is alan johnson with city of gresham is alan with us hi i see alan on the list hey rob this is alan can you hear me it's a little choppy but we can hear you at the city of course 15 minutes before so i'm trying to do it for my phone horrible stuff probably can't you're good but my name is alan johnston and i'm managing wastewater treatment program procession i've been involved in 20 years of renewable energy projects including arms recent net zero all right um that was a bit choppy allen i think we got just enough to to get get the message and um yeah the the gresham wastewater treatment plant has been a nice model of renewable energy for many many years and i'm glad to see that that has continued to develop thank you alan and moving on les perkins and i know les wears again several hats but under this because we have commissioner phil chang with deschutes county les comes to us as a representative of farmers irrigation district so less hi um so les perkins i've managed farmers irrigation district we have two low impact hydro institutes certified power houses produce about between 20 and 25 million kilowatt hours annually um i am also a hoodwork county commissioner have been for 20 years focusing mostly on energy water and forestry issues chair of the community renewable energy association and i'm a member of our energy council so in thinking about what kind of projects i'd love to see funded we've done a lot of work in our community and looking at resilience and critical infrastructure and really starting to zero in on development of microgrids and distributed generation so i would love to see some of the smaller projects that are marginal and difficult to finance that are distributed throughout our community we've got some microhydro potential some small scale solar potentially biomass there's a number of different options but to see some of these types of fun projects funded particularly in rural communities great great thank you less moving on to our representatives from non-governmental organizations that represent communities of low-income or disadvantaged households we will start with alessandra de la toure from rogue climate all right thank you rob um so again my name is alessandra de la torre i am calling from so-called ashland on unseated cow creek umkwa takama and modoclance and i use she her pronouns i'm the energy justice organizer for rogue climate which is a small environmental justice organization that serves communities in the south coast and also in southern oregon and actually got to work on the statewide campaign that was able to pass hp 2021 um and have us all here to implement it with that equity lens that it was created with i'm also just really excited more on the resiliency side for some some resilience hubs that could really serve community members to remain connected during emergencies and beyond and i'm also thinking about community owned solar thank you great thank you alessandra and thanks also for the work you did to get this program up and running i know that um house bill 2021 was a heavy lift and it had a lot of support from a lot of different folks and i think um it's really gonna you know creates a a lot of great opportunity to do some good where we haven't been able to do good in the past so we're really really happy that this bill came along and if you have this opportunity moving on we have nick johnson with lcri lake county re renewables resources that's a typo but nick are you with us can't recall if nick was able to make this time slot or not for for folks that we are expecting that are not with us we are working to send little reminders out so we may get we may get nick to join us before we're before we're through today that um we can move on to ariana and magnera and with verde and i think that a lot of us know ariana and uh i will pass it on hello my name is orianna manera i use she her pronouns i'm the energy climate and transportation manager at verde i also uh was involved in the oregon clean energy opportunity campaign uh with alessandra i'm grateful to be here and to talk about this opportunity in particular because my organization is not just concerned with where community-based projects are located or who benefits but really what the ownership structure is we're really interested in seeing more cooperatively owned projects that can provide wealth building opportunities for communities in addition to the resilience benefits of community-based or small-scale renewable um the potential bill-saving benefits of something like community solar but really figure out how to center in the the development of community-based renewable energy in a meaningful way great thank you ariana yeah i think among other things this program does give us an opportunity to look at hopefully some creative new ownership structures i know the bill leaves the door open for a variety of partnerships for ownership i think that with some uh with a with a bit of work we can hopefully see some projects that really bring not only energy and resilience benefits to communities but also financial benefits yeah that's a really great point i'm glad we have that in our discussions so finally for the last category representatives from relevant state and federal emergency management or response and i will start with mike harriman state resilience officer yeah good afternoon i'm mike mike herman the state resilience officer out of governor brown's office and thanks for inviting me to be part of this now you know i'm the caretaker of the oregon resiliency plan that that was introduced in 2011 for you know long-term 50-year mitigation to prepare the state for cascading subduction zone earthquake and since uh been appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate in may of 2016 just really stretching my wings around all hazard type stuff and so we've seen over the last 20 months of the difference from covid to wildfires dice storms to flooding the heat waves we have numerous single point of failures when it comes to energy i'd like to make sure we see some opportunities around our infrastructure i'll just name a few communications public safety hospitals and water and wastewater facilities where we could have more than one two or three power sources that could produce a stable platform for those folks so that the burden of trying to move fuel into these critical infrastructures will be hampered because the road system will pretty well severely damaged i'd like to just as a project i'd like to see you know we have 11 hospitals along the coast i think you heard most of them under their cms rules are required at 96 hours of backup power and that's usually diesel generator it would be nice to see something where they could have solar and battery power so they don't put the burden on the state agencies namely odo to deliver diesel fuel you know on that fourth or fifth day um if that hospital is still operational after an earthquake and a tsunami that's just one one example um but",

        "text": " that and the staff's made that clear in this in the draft proposed order and the applicant alleges this site would have minimal other environmental impacts that may be less than other portions of the subject property but it still will have environmental for this particular site the point that i've made over the last several meetings about taking an exception to agricultural lands that um this particular site in fact cult cultivated agricultural land or has been cultivated agricultural land and qualifies um as arable land under the land conservation delta commission administrative rules we are taking an exception to statewide planning goal three through this process specifically for this 2000 acres and i think that's the point that i've been trying to make is why is this particular portion of property different than other cultivated property in umatilla county and central oregon and tim uses the word unique i don't think it's one of a kind i think exceptions process could be met on other properties but i do think that the reasons that are necessary for justifying the exceptions have to be specific to this particular property i don't think the applicant has shown particular portion of cropland is any different than any other cropland in the region and i think that's where i'm having difficulty um with agreeing with the exceptions that has been presented to us and so my point is we it may not be unique as tim has described but it has to be there have to be reasons why this parcel versus any other parcel um in central and eastern oregon that is in cultivated cropland um is and why is it different and why should it be exempt from protection of agricultural where other property is subject to those so that's kind of where i stand on this thank you thank you mr jenkins is there any other um council member who'd like to be heard uh yes there is this is kent howe and i'm on the council we can't hear you okay i can hear you now go ahead whenever you're ready go ahead okay i want to follow up on the goal 3 issue as well rather than reiterating what hanley just said or mr jenkins i agree with uh what councilor jenkins has said and i'm going to try to add a little bit more to it that may help the applicant in getting to additional information that i feel we need in order to make a finding that the goal 3 exception has been met and uh first of all taking an exception to goal has a very high threshold it's the way in oregon that we allow removing agricultural land from oregon's agricultural land the burdens on the applicant to provide us with adequate reasons from which we can make findings that we can use to adopt our own conclusions of law in support of the application i don't think unique is the word that we want to use here it's not that it's the only place that this could occur but what are the reasons that sets it aside this this 19 roughly 1900 acres what sets those 1900 acres aside from the other 227 300 acres in umatilla county that's in dry land winter wheat it's not an exception to the rest of the dry land winter wheat fields in umatilla county if it's if we're not making something that distinguishes it from those other and so maybe it's not the reasons of why it's unique but the reasons that distinguishes the loss of that agricultural land where the solar facilities proposed is different from the other 227 000 that would allow us to take that exception to goal 3 and justify removing it from oregon's agricultural land inventory um you know i don't know what it is maybe it's its proximity to the wind turbine facility in the adjacent ancillary facilities maybe it's a there needs to be something besides the fact that it's you know eight tenths of a percent of org of the dry land wheat that's harvested in um umatilla county of the acreages of dryland tweet that's harvested and just that statistic doesn't cut it for me it doesn't really distinguish it those other 227 000 acres of dry land wheat in um umatilla county so that's what i'm going to need in order to be able to say we've got an adequate to justify an exception to goal 3 or the that the facility would be placed on that's my comments thank you mr howe um all right any other comments from sorry cindy condon member of the council miss condon go ahead whenever you're thank you mine are going to be sounds simple compared to the goal 33 exception i just want to take the opportunity again to talk about the organizational expertise and the findings of fact if not a deficiency an issue with me putting together that nolan hills is our applicant and throughout the document actually um applicant is used and then capital power is used and to me those aren't consistent um and i there's nothing in the findings of factor the dpo that suggests to me other than the comment tonight thank you very that capital power is that will stand behind this llc that today is in name only and so to me that's a deficiency in the organizational expertise um that's a simple way of saying it and then if i can just move on to the decommissioning and the financial um standard the responsibility standard we take um a comfort letter or review a comfort letter that in this application is received from the royal bank of canada and names again capital and i understand that and it's refers to a specific date that as of march 2nd 2022 and i realize that's probably the date of review that there was significant significant capital of financial reserves to to issue a letter for capital power this project may may not be due for some for me that comfort letter doesn't doesn't provide much comfort i guess given the very specific way it was written at a point in time for capital power not whole nolan hills and um i i i would like to to strengthen that i guess if even if capital power or the parent company uh had a statement on the record uh saying that yeah we are the responsible entity and our credit facility pertains to this and it is is available for this so there you go thank you thank you miss condon okay yes i'm sorry did you have anything else oh no sorry i didn't i just thought you had a question of me thank you oh no no thank you okay anyone else with counsel well i'm not hearing any so i just want to check in and make sure that there's no one else that wanted to provide any comments at this point and then we'll go back to applicant to talk about responses to comments but anyone in person or on the phone or on webex that wants to make comments raise your hand or make yourself known i'm not hearing any and i don't see any hands raised okay so let's um go back to the applicant who is going to speak for the applicant in terms of responses to any of the comments received or let's see is that mr mcmahon are you the one who just sat yes thank you your honor tim mcmahon again for the record we would like some um opportunity to respond to the comments that have been made and actually we're going to ask for a 30-day continuance of the hearing leaving the record open for 30 days to give us an opportunity to do that but um we uh move along here i would ask mr corey to come back up as a witness and representative of the project and the landowner to provide some additional thank you and and i just had a few comments um one of the difficulties is that i hadn't actually had an opportunity probably had the opportunity i didn't get done the review of the full staff report on where it came up with some of the assumptions but in listening to what i think is would be good and natural questions from the staff report uh by uh by the council i can see a few things that are that we'll have we'll come back and and present but one of the things that's important i think about this site because it's really very intentionally selected from among the acres that are in the 43 000 acres is that it's the very poorest farmland that we have and i've harvested grain on this property as a youngster all the way up and and my brother doug who's here that i mentioned earlier when i testified uh both of us can tell you in driving combines through it if you look at the lands that we have this is the very poorest field that we've got it's not a high producing field whatsoever second thing is it has no water and we actually were selective and making sure that it wasn't something that we would be interrupting any water rights on i did testify to a third thing is that this seems maybe a little stupid but the fact is you drive into pendleton off reef wreath ridge and you see a see a sign that uh watch out for glare but it doesn't tell you how come well the reason is you're going around a bend and going right into solar project that's owned by the city of pendleton that's uh that's right below the freeway and i sort of always uh i got to serve on the transportation commission as similar to you uh for a number of years and i don't know how we actually came up with that sign i hope it wasn't while i was there but at any rate this i can guarantee this site is removed so remote that you've got a piece of property that happens to have the right topography flat uh and the right location next to an existing proposed wind project and right next to where the battery storage in the substation is and also located close to the north end of the property where it's accessible very quickly if you have problems with the solar it isn't as though you've got to drive the extra 10 or 11 12 miles to get to where the wind may be part of maybe so it does have a uniqueness and importance to us in terms of of how and where we cited it and then in terms of the percentages which i totally agree and i know how you came up with a 36 percent i didn't say anything about it but that calculation is is not applicable here but you haven't been told why it isn't applicable the lands that we already have in crp and i think we refer to them in my but you look at the lanes we have in crp similar to this land where the solar site is going to go they've got to be in the figure but what you're comparing it to is simply apples to oranges the",

        "text": " upgrading or has added a ductless heat pump in the path and is adding more another um so the homes program is really focused on the outcome of estimated Energy savings so if the those projects in combination um meet the minimum Energy savings threshold requirements they would potentially be eligible for the homes program um and then the here program is based on what's being installed and it's not uh tied to an existing equipment requirement so it would also likely be eligible under that program um okay perfect and then um I'm now seeing that somebody already put a link to look up more details on Ami in the chat so somebody can do that if they want to know more about households um can you offer details on modeling software yet for can tell you what the federal requirements for uh energy modeling are um so uh actually in the legislation in the inflation reduction act uh they reference the BPI 2400 standard as the methods for doing energy um modeling for the program so um any software that we um allow needs to be able to meet those minimum requirements um and usdoe has been in the process of uh evaluating programs to ensure that they do comply and has a list on their website of um software that is uh confirmed to be allowable for the program um and we don't intend to restrict the software um to like a single type we would be intending to allow uh the use of any software that usdoe deems eligible great um Erna thank you for Thanking us for taking questions um you're welcome and uh the measures that we're seeing on the screen right now that we've now had people look at for a while she's just wondering if we plan on making if we we believe that those will be available here in Oregon at Le the measures that Oregon will offer yeah so we don't intend to reduce the number of measures that are eligible for the he program although that is an option that some states um can take okay uh we got another question question about timeline which we're going to get to in a second somebody wanted to know if we could show the homes rebate slide our slides will be available on our program website so I will put that into the chat when I'm next done talking and then um so you can look at the whole slide deck if you'd like and then Dougan spokes to no tax rebates are only available for the year in which equipment is placed in service I think tax credits is the the right word there um so only for the year in which equipment is placed in and let's see um cap weatherization programs based on doe standards often include occupant comfort as a goal of efficiency upgrades does that not apply to homes and here upgrades um so there are considerations that uh can be included the uh what we've been presenting so far has been mainly what are the US doe um minimum requirements for the programs um and we have been looking at whether and which additional requirements we need to include as part of the programs um there is a a strong push to ensure that uh projects that are undertaken under these programs actually result in utility bill Savings in addition to Energy savings for the occupants of the homes as well as um consideration for other factors like occupant Comfort um or other benefits to the household that are important like improved Health outcomes by you know having a house that's heated properly and isn't growing mold those kind of um additional considerations but um they aren't part of the kind of minimum outline that us doe has provided for the prog great and um see so what will the I kind of feel like we just maybe answered this but it got asked maybe while we were answering it um what will the qual what will the qualifications for the energy modelers be I think um so it's gonna follow that BPI 2400 standard and it's like a software it's not like like different types of contractors can use it use that software versus there being like a professional um there is I believe um some minimum amount of of training or Andor experience that's required um and we can um kind of highlight that there's the additional Workforce Development funding um and we intend to um make sure that some of that funding is made available to help support people who want to become energy modelers to help participate in the in the homes program so it's our goal that that funding will help help support participation um and the ability of uh contractors or other energy professionals to to step in and do the type of work that's needed great all right we have one last question for now and then even if other ones come in I'm gonna just wait from here so this one is are there require are there requirements for appliances to be installed at the same time as the upgrades and then oh one real quick thing while you marinate on that um we realized that we don't have the slides posted yet because we were still finalizing them so they'll be posted hopefully pretty quickly but if they're not there right now when you go to look to look back at the slides just know they'll be there soon and then back to appliances installed at the same time as upgrades yes or no um so the here program is a um is the cap on project so they the the projects could be done separately um Within that space But the eligibility I believe for the like electric work is that it's tied to some Appliance so if the timing was staggered for other reasons it could all still be eligible it would just all need to be part of um a related upgrade and then for the homes program um the there is some provision for um like related costs to be included in those but the the rebate caps for that program vary from um by the federal standard from $2 to $8,000 so it may not cover some of those additional expenses the same way uh that the here program specifically covers them great all right well that was great thanks for the questions in the chat when we get to questions in the future which is coming up later in comments folks can also raise their hands so they can verbally participate but with that I'll turn things back hi there um will can I get the next slide please oh you got it um hi I'm Christina Donnelly I use she her pronouns I'm the senior incentives analyst working on the homes and here programs um I can't see the chat so if any clarifying questions come in uh please interrupt me Christie um so at our previous webinars we had asked several questions about the program's potential design and so we wanted to give you an update about how this other feedback that we've received have influenced our current plans so we heard about the need to ensure that rebates cover as much of the project costs as possible for low-income households so for the homes program we're proposing to increase the rebate cap for low-income customers from 8,000 to 10,000 per project and increase the rebate limit for low-income customers from 80% of project costs to 100% of project costs in addition for the here program we're proposing to increase the overall low-income allocation from 40% to 60% of total available rebates and to increase the overall allocation for multif family households from 10% to 20% um at the previous webinar we also talked about retroactivity but as Stephanie noted and we talked a bit about us doe has issued guidance that the homes rebates must be available to projects initiated after August 16th 2022 but all projects must still meet all of our program requirements including the requirements for the home assessment and modeling the expected Energy savings we've also heard feedback that we should make the minimum efficiency standards consistent between the two programs so we plan to match the energy star certification requirements where applicable while allowing for uh local programs to set higher standards where funds may be braided together for heat pumps we will also require Ahri certificates to ensure the efficiency minimums are met in addition we also know that the Portland clean energy fund is well resourced at the moment and so in Portland we plan to prioritize multif family households and disadvantaged communities that have been identified by the justice 40 initiative which which Emily talked a bit about earlier so next please so we uh would also like to provide an update for our proposed implementation strategy so basically how do we plan to build out the essential components of the program and then administer them once they are up and running so we are planning to issue an RFP to hire a contractor to build some of our systems that we need to operate the programs including the rebate processing and management system we're still developing the expected scope of work for that RFP and we'll be sure to make a public announcement about it when it's released we also plan to work with two entities which uh the application and we're referring to as implementers who will issue rebates to applicants Odo plans to issue an RFP to find an implementer for customers in consumer owned utility and Idaho Power service areas and then in investor owned utility service areas we're planning to issue rebates through the Energy Trust of Oregon which is an independent nonprofit organization charged by the Oregon Public Utilities Commission to administer rate payer funded Energy Efficiency and renewable energy programs in the state of Oregon in investor owned utility service areas we think that this implementation structure is going to help us learn from and take advantage of eto's existing experience uh administering these kinds of programs while also helping us launch the programs as quickly and effectively as possible other states such as Maine have also have who also have a Statewide utility program administer are using a similar structure to implement these programs in their state as well once the programs launch oo will continue to work in close collaboration with our implementers to ensure that the programs are running eff efficiently and that we continue to meet all of our program requirements and goals so next slide please so we uh wanted to give you an idea of our overall timeline although the projected dates to begin issuing rebates is still uncertain uh we wanted to share with you some of the major Milestones that we're going to have to pass along the way so right now Odo is developing the first part of our application to us doe which is due as Emily said in January of 2025 that we intend to submit at the end of this month while we wait for USD to review and approve that submission we're going to continue to develop a lot of the details that we've been discussing today through what usdoe is calling the blueprint um this is going to describe how the programs",

        "text": " we're going to work on today you know is the Criterion wait yeah we're going to hopefully develop my charity today if narrative we adopted the full list of eligible measures that are provided in the federal guidance side next slide this is a slightly abbreviated list from the federal guidance measure of Life utility full management vegetation management reconductorate underground a real hardening measures two-thirds of the way down you'll see there's an asterisk on the microgrids and batteries those are eligible Technologies under the program but we have another program I don't know the fund those and the feedback that we got the utilities was to focus more on the hardens and so that's going to be our focus in the first two rounds and also like pulling down for the last measure so the last bullet here new generation and cyber security are not included in this program it's a new generation includes solar wind type the generation projects that could be tied to uh are there any that stand out to you is most interesting or kind of propellant in terms of projects that you were coming in thank you yeah we'll give everyone a moment if it but I really like the list in general I think I think the development of this holistic I'll put a lot of thought I'm into it I'm going to speak for our system just because that's that's what I know um relocation reconducting and Powerline very important to this vegetation management and fuel of management is very important to this Fleet at 1600 miles of power lines that crisscross and the most burgundy service territory surrounding you know 30 foot right away surrounded by 150 foot trees so anything that we can do to mitigate that risk it doesn't really matter whether it's fire or snow or anything or when that's when those trees go down so I like the middle part that listed a lot only speaking from from my viewpoint as as you evaluate some of the stuff I would think that folks in the city may go months and months and months without an average uh folks in the country they may go weeks you know sometimes days depending on where they live so I think it needs to be weighted that day uh a little bit again is speaking for me uh as you're considering that I was uh looking at the actual reliability statistics of the areas that are impacted by it if you're if you're aiming at a more resilient period than the places that are out or should it should be a lot more thank you so I'm looking at uh distributed energy resources including micro birds and batteries and there's like an it's got the same amount of funding as this program focuses on microgrids and renewable energy and for that reason we're steering this program more away from microbrids and towards the grid hardening and so while it's an eligible measure of the program it's um it's not going to be a priority with them small criteria unless we decide as a group that we want to change that okay great thank you Bob is announcement include that in the sum part of it that it's clear that this funding could not be used for certain uh measures like the purchase of solar panels so it's more like complementary measures is that right yeah so that sub is qualifying that last goal of where a new generation is not included but batteries on their own can be considered a distributed internet resource of program will provide a batteries but not new as as we look at the by consequence extreme events that have occurred over the last several years large Geographic areas are are shut down dead bust as part of the creation Public Safety power cutoffs and this program Health utilities designed for intentional islanding like cougar dam was brought back online and I in the heated battle so can this program help BPA and and the core and utilities come up with contingency plans at one of wildfires coming through a particular area or an ice storm or whatever they can you know isolate the threatened areas without losing power to large swaths of Defenders yeah so the monitoring and control technology excluded using and circuit reclosers and all sorts of brain control hanging some of our Utility Partners can speak in that development to a degree that's kind of hard to do the way our system or instructors and so much the model system um so it's you know for us example we can't I don't know it's dark there's the island of portions of our system because there's no other source of wow I mean you could iron a lot of stuff so we don't have generation internally to be able to say you know take this second off but we can back them through here because we have our own generation but building more transition to be able to have loot speeds and other feeds in fact definitely would help them we don't have a lot of distributive generation I know Pacific Northwest National Labs is working on how to Island small Hydro working with BTA and the poor and BLM that might be something to explore yeah good idea but one one thing we had we had a 100 system out of in 2019 due to a snow storm and one thing down about three quizzes and folks didn't have communications infrastructure didn't have enough reliable backup um sustainable so we not only will power we kind of went darker down when system went down because uh you know Jared the college field wasn't fueled or possibly didn't start I can't remember the exact thing you know this could help folks are in the communications and protector and provide reliable backup power so you can communicate because that got to be a pretty hard to stand a system back up when no one could talk on excellent no we have a kind of on the same lines of this fund any sort of backup power or individual not for individual residences but something like emergency response and Communications that's probably an instance where this program could look at batteries and put them in a positive competitive Light Within the Matrix that that's what the group decides we want to um so that's a good example and we're Standalone batteries can bring a lot of value outside of the discussion of microgrids and solar and stuff but just you know electricity along with a tall Vision but one thing that that's notable taught us was all the other utilities right and I says well we're clean water wastewater firefighting all of those without electricity didn't work right so happy Brazilian degree was beneficial but also been having the ability to to stand alone for short periods of time while things are being rebuilt I think is very important for folks to consider as well so could the results of the concept be supported by this or like a community center it's not an individual but a community center would be able to to support the essential services that would probably go through our crap program but resilience novel much more likely to go through that from the town because this could not for example by the solo or any generation for the site um and the feedback we've had pretty overwhelmingly from utilities is to focus on the more traditional we're reliability measures and there's other lots of funding that are focusing on the voting balance that so we've got good opportunities to fund those to stop in this program I think most most Utilities in our headphones we have backup generators to keep things online but more non-resistible will another random is solar with battery storage it's a limit pattern as we started the generator we can run for short average times off of our battery stores and not have to start the generator that's right um order provided and then we also as part of that and provide a community gathering in place for folks during this low-income housing it's a little mobile home trailer parks and things would be a place to town stay warm and more stay cool and get water and those kind of things not for this program we have a couple of questions uh from folks participating virtually I want to make sure to move into so we've got a question on resources to help rural counties plan so they can participate in these programs you know something that we've talked about as potential technical assistance and we've also interacted a number of written documents that will be available like items but are there any additional thoughts on that my understanding is that this does not provide planning funds and instructions my understanding that it really is construction projects plus some Instagram both of theirs so planning that's another thing that we could do through the sea breath program we have planning funds which also build a session a bit of access to provide exponents and penalties you're planning so there are resources getting in that direction but again and then a follow-on on backup uh our wood program Sprint Customer owned backup generators be eligible and I can be a number of this some of the previous questions yeah um customer all resources available in this program the only eligible applicants are electric utility can you speak to you know you're seeking our feedback you know what jumps out at you from this list how are you going to use this input from this open house because you've already submitted your application and presumably so are you just trying to get some of the fine details or are you trying to rank based on our comments what you're going to uh say is the highest use of these types of projects you're going to say you know for example Douglas likes um you know reconductoring so we should move that up on the list in terms of the projects to be funded or how are you going to use this open house information that you're Gathering I guess yeah so we're starting with these sort of broad discussions to get an idea of the types of projects that we're going to see and we'll actually talk about some specific projects in a couple of slides and we want to focus that as we go through today so that in another hour or less we're actually creating a list of selection criteria with the weight for how the competitive review process has been available in this program so that's what we want to build today is the competitive selection criteria get a hierarchy for how that looks we've got some proposed broad categories for those criteria that we'll look at and talk but really right now is our blank page for criteria and that's where we're going with all of this is to establish that process so we have as I understand it we have nine million dollars right here one 19 billion dollars for year one is right now 9.9 it'll get both years in the first okay all right so hear me out so for the c-o-u-n which I'm mostly is that 40 of 9 million you're one right so that's 3.9 million that's Brit is math not mine so we could go back to that budget I'm going to make a point here",

think that's pretty helpful but I don't want to put pressure on people to feel like you have to do that either if you don't think of your question until the work session or you don't have time to email us perfectly fine to ask that and that's why we've scheduled so many work sessions on these topics because they are very complicated and we expect that there will be a lot of questions I think I'm getting stuck on so work sessions doesn't does or does not involve public comment work sessions do not okay yeah so work sessions just an opportunity for um staff to share information it really is the right time to ask a lot of questions of us because we're not under that formal hearing structure that we will be later in the summer thank you what we want to make sure of though that is that we don't get into deliberations in the work session so it really is more about questions and um that kind of interaction and we don't expect that by the next work session you will have read all of that and have all your questions um and some of your questions will be answered in the in the staff report um so there are there is time at the work sessions there'll be time at the first hearing and we are expecting since these are so big that there will be two or three hearings and so there there'll be time within that as well to ask questions if they don't get answered through the staff reports and the you know the written and oral staff reports thank you and you can ask questions at the hearings too so many opportunities anything else for that's thank you very much next item is Communication uh is anyone signed up to speak to us tonight we don't have anyone signed up tonight um so uh we asked that people start by saying their full name and location and looks like we have one person online who would like to communicate to the Planning Commission on a non-agenda item and it looks like that person is Jim long hi my name's Jim long I'm head of CPO 4M but I'm not here speaking for them one of the things I've talked to you about earlier is I put together a burden Critter list it has over 373 different species of animals and and all creatures that live in Washington County but I want to speak about something that happened back on uh April 7th early in the spring we're here now in summer but early in the spring at 7 a.m. six chainsaws started cutting trees and debris and underbrush in the yard in the Nature park behind us which apparently they were under the oses of the county with clean water services and they wreck the habitat the habitat's been Disturbed this was during The Mating Season and breeding season and there aren't many birds that exist now around there you just can't hear them there is the migratory bird treaty act which so they shouldn't be any grading or disturbing or cutting of things during breeding and mating season and that's something that needs to be changed in a code for clean water services or someplace there should be times when it can happen and when it can happen also we didn't receive any notice that this was going on so it was a total shock uh so I'm going to leave it at that I think habitat you know the codes need to change so I'm going to leave it at that you thank you Mr fine seeing nobody else we can move on okay chair Lockwood uh commissioner will perhap perhaps we lost Mr long I just wanted to ask a followup question if if Mr long felt that this was a regular scheduled maintenance that needs to be better scheduled or was it a special uh project if he's still available I don't see any sign oh he's here yeah I can hear you Jim go ahead not not anything that was early schedule they just came in uh I talked to them I I mean I my first impulse was to call 911 to have it stopped I I wish I had done that but I didn't but the the one person cutting the the chainsaw next to next to we I'll get my I'll get my super bad the supervisor came over and he said they were doing work for Clean Water Services uh but this was unscheduled this was not something that was supposed to be happening and habitat's important for humans it's also really important for wildlife so I'm just looking for some protections so we can can move forward and and treat them uh they live here too uh so does that answer your question do you have another question well I guess you answered it I appreciate it I just was trying to get for the for the record if if they tried to Proclaim or answer to you if you spoke with them that that hey they come out every year and do some trimming or was this a special treatment to solve some special problem because I what I'm hearing in your concern is is that they should not schedule regular trimming right in the middle of Mating Season or migratory season they should schedule regular maintenance you know at the appropriate time is what I I hear you're saying but and but even worse if it was a special thing like they were getting ready for a manhole replacement in that Creek bed location that they should also schedule special events at the correct time but I'm just curious if you have a sense of what you think was happening I don't think it was a regular thing I think they were cleaning out some underbrush it could have been related to invasive species but I'm not sure I I I I wish I wish we had answers to those questions ahead of time or knew about them beforehand because they just kept going all the way in many acres here they they kept going and going um and and indeed we talked to the guy and he said oh I'm a biologist understand and he understood that they were destroying things so my hands are up in the air I don't know what to do except for come here and talk to you about this stuff and I'm sorry did you say at the beginning of your testimony the date uh April 7th or April 9th let me see here it was uh April 9th bir already nesting Tuesday Morning the birds were already nesting um you know it's there's been a severe change in the in the hearing around here the the the birds the animals they just aren't back like they used to be and and I'm sorry I guess another followup question is you said behind your area where you live did you have an address or a name of a park uh the name of the park it's near it's near durksen Nature Park Summer Creek is in the back uh this where I was that morning was uh at the end of 114th place okay okay thank you for those D it's a it's a protected Green Space or it's supposed to be a protected Green Space okay thank you for added details I appreciate your your comments thank you looks like we have no one else who wants to all right share comments thank you let's uh move to our work session on significant natural resources thank CH Lockwood Michelle Miller Senior planner and Kathy corus our Consultants will give presentation good evening chair Lockwood and Commissioners my name is Michelle Miller sen your planner with land um tonight we're also joined by Kathy corus with Mig Planning Group um she's our principal and project manager consultant on this project and she'll be giving part of the presentation tonight when we get to our code Concepts hold that back a little bit so we can hear you oh this one okay so at the last uh work session we briefed you on the County's existing goal five program for natural resources and talked about some of the state rules and requirements that have brought about the comprehensive um plan and code changes that you'll soon be considering we talked about the board's Direction and introduced you to the work we've been doing in response to that tonight's work session Zooms in on the focus look project including our update to the natural resource inventory Maps a preview of the code Concepts and the community outreach and engagement that has been ongoing over the course of the 18month project all of this is to give you some more background and to become familiar with the topic in the process and to help you prepare for the hearings um what which will um begin on July 24th and I'll plenty of time for questions as go forward so the significant natural resources a focused look at fish and wildlife habitat is based on our Statewide planning goal five um program um it's about identifying and protection of significant natural resources this project um has two categories of uh goal five natural resources that provide habitat for fish and wildlife we undertook this project to respond to the state law changes and the legal challenges that we talked about uh at our last meeting here's our project website where people were able to get information about the project sign up for updates um get background on goal five and then we had a frequently asked questions as well and um our significant natural resources a focused look uh followed the state what state required process for goal five and this graphic shows the three main steps of that process for natural resources that we were following began with the m mapping and identifying the natural resources uh in our case we started with the existing natural resource inventory mapping within the urban area and and considered what is sign ific um since our original mapping was done as the inventory work was underway we moved to step two the analysis phase where we identified the major types of land uses that could conflict with natural resources and then did some analysis to balance the level of protection of the resource with land uses like housing or Transportation balancing also included getting feedback from stakeholders with different perspectives including a technical advisory committee um with representative from various agencies and stakeholders as well and meetings with the community uh to get feedback on our process final step is um oops the final step is taking that analysis and developing the policies and the land use regulations for development that have taken those impacts into account and to help us through this process we hired Cathy's firm to um um who and worked with an internal team and um and to get uh to work on the the policies and the regulations which is our step three here's our project schedule broken down by the various tasks within the go five Pro process the bulk of the time has",

        "text": " to wildfires dice storms to flooding the heat waves we have numerous single point of failures when it comes to energy i'd like to make sure we see some opportunities around our infrastructure i'll just name a few communications public safety hospitals and water and wastewater facilities where we could have more than one two or three power sources that could produce a stable platform for those folks so that the burden of trying to move fuel into these critical infrastructures will be hampered because the road system will pretty well severely damaged i'd like to just as a project i'd like to see you know we have 11 hospitals along the coast i think you heard most of them under their cms rules are required at 96 hours of backup power and that's usually diesel generator it would be nice to see something where they could have solar and battery power so they don't put the burden on the state agencies namely odo to deliver diesel fuel you know on that fourth or fifth day um if that hospital is still operational after an earthquake and a tsunami that's just one one example um but we have a lot of special districts i'd like to see them you know the utilities irrigation districts and things like that have the opportunity to maintain something so they're not support have to be supported by the big ious when there's a bad day in the state thank you thanks for inviting me i look forward to working all right thank you mike and uh really really glad to have you on the team and to bring that perspective to the group i think is really really helpful and uh yeah moving on brandy martin um office of cyber security and is brandy with us yeah she is so ready you're muting apologies can you hear me now there we uh it's only been what 16 18 months should know by now um i'm brandi martin i am the state local tribal territorial program manager at caesar so it's cyber security energy security and emergency response at doe looks like i'm i'm the federal person on the advisory committee um i very much appreciate oregon including me in this i think the legislation in this bill is a step in the right direction very it's a conversation we're having with the white house at the moment with the new administration with doe across the board looking at questions around energy i appreciate a lot of the converse the comments earlier about um you know community ownership so we talked about energy democracy how are we making sure we're including conversations um and having ownership at the disadvantaged community level um we're also very much focused on our side on risk so right looking at energy security a lot of the comments around infrastructure how are we it's not always um necessarily the flashiest or the most fun projects but how are we making sure existing infrastructure is either hardened or raised against flooding taking those measures we need to keep the lights on and the fuel as far as a renewable project i'd love to see uh you know microgrid or mike mentioned storage the idea of you have these benefits during uh steady state blue sky days but also have that that back up during uh events and then um you know of the existing infrastructure anything else that can help weatherize or strengthen against those those ice storms and those wildfires and everything else we're going to see as as climate change is continuing to impact us thanks so thank you brandi finally our last representative stan thomas oregon office of emergency management good afternoon everyone thank you so much for uh allowing me to participate on this and what i see is a a very very important committee um i work for the oregon office of emergency management soon to become the oregon department of emergency on july 1 2022 thanks to assistance from the legislature in the governor's office last year in the last session i'm the deputy director for the mitigation and recovery section of oregon emergency management really what that is is our team here liaisons with fema after catastrophic events or disasters to build communities back we also manage the hazard mitigation program which is there's a certain percentage of funds that come to the to help reduce hazards throughout oregon after disasters part of my involvement and wanting to be part of this committee as far as projects from what i look at the catastrophic wildfires of 2020 are a good example where we are rebuilding several communities and how do we rebuild build back better how do we build in resiliency and how can we build in renewable energy when we've lost all of our infrastructure and be able to come back a little bit smarter a little bit more efficient and the other thing too with our hazard mitigation program is there opportunities for us to partner and force multiply uh the work that's being done out of odoe along with our hazard mitigation funds for renewable energy where that might be applicable so very excited to be part of this i heard a lot of resiliency i heard a lot of renewable energy for emergency management throughout the comments here today and i look forward to being a part of this and doing whatever we can at oem to help us move forward in a positive fashion thank you all right well again thank you all for for being with us and agreeing to support this effort i'm trying to keep an eye on the list and i don't think i've seen commissioner chang or nick enter our list of folks today so i think we will move on but um you know getting this group of people together and seating this advisory committee was our first really heavy lift for this program and luckily i work with some people who are quite well connected and and had some help reaching out across the state to get folks and you know this is one of those things where um you know you you hear the saying don't stop until you're proud and i think that what we got with this committee makes us all proud we've got a really robust group of people here and i'm really excited to work with all of you to to get this program up and running so thank you for joining us and with those introductions complete i think we will move on to our kind of orientation part of the program this is going to include a little overview of house bill 2021 and i think there's plenty of folks on this meeting that probably know a lot more about it than i um who will help to get it passed but i just want to talk through some of the some of the big picture on the bill to get us all in the um right kind of mode for putting this program together and starting to talk about the actual rules and policies that will run the program so with that said hey rob i just wanted to mention that i put in the chat a link to the pdf um of this power point that's posted on our website in case people wanted to sort of follow along or use it as a reference i also just wanted to pause and say that you had a question you're welcome to use the chat or the raise hand function again i know we're going through at a quick clip so if something is popping into your mind please do uh use that thanks rob thank you ruchi yeah it's it's nice to have a team of staff helping to get through these online meetings because there's a lot of moving parts and uh it's easy to kind of get drawn off into the into the screen when you're the one doing most of the talking so thank you ruchi for hearing that and um yeah so these slides will be uh they are available on the website we hope that they're a resource and feel free to open it up and jump ahead if you want to see what's what's coming so but house bill 2021 it did a lot of established hundred percent clean any energy targets and these are going to be handled primarily by the puc and deq natural gas plant restrictions in this case the oregon department of energy staff are working with the energy facility citing council tackling some of those the community renewable energy grant program and that's why we're all here also has some studies one of those is a study on small scale renewable energy this is a piece of oregon policy that's been active for quite a few years and we're going to try to figure out a little more of what what it means to be a small scale renewable energy project and some of the challenges facing those types of projects green energy tariffs this is a puc contractor labor standards um odo is working with an online portal to develop an online portal and finally within the rps the community-based renewable energy target changed from eight percent to ten percent and this was the share of projects that are below 20 megawatts in size if it's not a biomass cogen project that are deemed community based renewables and so that target went from eight percent to ten percent and the poc is conducting a rule making um to help provide some clarification in that program the studies that came to us from this session again the small-scale renewable energy there's also a study for what it would look like to establish an rto or regional transmission in the northwest and that study is ongoing some of you may have been attending the meetings that adam schultz has been for for the regional transmission organization study up and coming is a study on floating offshore wind and i think that we'll probably shannon helping us out on that one too i'm not sure if that process is going to have a committee and if it's been formed yet but we're going to look at offshore wind and finally a study on renewable hydrogen and so if you're interested in following any of these studies or taking part in supporting oregon department of energy and implementing these studies there's an option to get involved with these projects on the oregon department of energy website going into the sections of the bill that actually established this grant program it's at the end of the bill starting with section 29 and we are grateful to have a bill that gives us a clear kind of purpose which has not always been a part of every incentive program in oregon so the bill states that the purpose of the is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy and so that is the stated purpose of program as it reads in the bill and i think it does a pretty good job of laying out what's trying to be done here and so with that in mind they reinforce it in a few ways one",

to get started our chat's already a little bit busy so if you'll forgive me I'll just uh share a couple things from here yes the recording will be available on our website afterwards and if you can't hear us now then the audio is not working we were just waiting to get started to give folks a couple minutes to join and I will back away now thanks chrisy I think this is a good time to um get started and kick off this conversation so again thank you everyone for joining us today um for the home energy rebate programs public listening session we are um we are joined today by several of my colleagues here at the Oregon Department of energy um and I will I will have them introduce themselves as we go through this um as we go through this presentation um my name is Emily salary I am one of our federal grants officers here at Odo and um I work to help bring some federal dollars into the state um such as these uh rebates that we will be working on together um over the coming years um next slide please all right just an uh an introduction into what we'll be going through today um to start I will give you a background on where this funding comes from a rough timeline um some related programs that we have here at Odo as well as background on the justice 40 initiative um and then we'll jump into the specific programs the the here program as well well as the homes program and we'll have some time for a Q&amp;A um and then from there we're going to flip the tables around on you all and ask some questions of of you um next please all right and before we uh before we jump into the home Energy rebates just a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of energy or oo as you might hear us referred to if you're if you're new to our agency um on this slide you'll see our vision mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission the funding opportunities that we'll be discussing today will help Odo support a resilient and affordable Energy System as well as a clean energy transition next slide please all right and if you're new to using um WebEx the platform that we're using today for this conversation um here's a quick guide on how you can use some of the features all of our attendees are off camera right now and muted but our host will unmute you if we call in you to ask a question you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under the participants panel if you click near your name there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar feel free to use the chat function to ask questions and make comments and um make sure to send those to all panelists or everyone so that all of the Odo staff can see it and help respond we'll also try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands but we may not have time for all of them today and we'll talk a little bit more about that later um I noticed that some people have called in on the phone you can press star six to raise your hand and star are three to unmute yourself when we call on you and the host unmutes you from our end um and then I want to make sure you know that today's listening session is being recorded and the recording will be posted to our website later on today next slide please thank you all right so jumping into the home Energy rebates this is going to be a little background on where they came from and how they came to be so the US Congress passed a large Federal package known as the 22 inflation reduction act or the IRA as some of you might hear it referred to that included a number of Grants tax incentives and rebates to help consumers lower their energy usage and save on energy bills the home Energy rebates are actually a pair of programs that are available to States through the US Department of energy so the rebates are two separate but complimentary Grant programs that the um Department uh excuse me that o Odo will apply to through the US Department of energy we will apply for those federal dollars through a Grant application process which includes laying out a plan for how to offer rebates to Residents within the state for Approved purposes these applications could not begin until the US Department of energy provided the requirements of the applications and guidance and clarification on any federal policies the initial guidance was released at the end of July and um many of the program policies were laid out in the federal guidance so while many are left to the individual states um to determine that will be a part of our um our application process um two of my colleagues who will be um discussing both of these programs a little bit later will and Stephanie will give an overview of each of these programs and we'll ask some questions regarding areas where oo has to design policies for these programs you'll see um homes is the Home Efficiency rebate program otherwise known as homes um and those are going to be performance-based rebates for Energy Efficiency retrofits the second program um lovingly called here are going to be the home electrification and appliance rebate program and these rebates are for high efficiency electric appliances and certain Associated upgrades um Oregon will not have the funds for these programs until the grant applications have been accepted negotiated and an award has been um given to the Department of um energy here in Oregon the deadline for applying for these funds is January 31st 2025 and defending the programs is going to take a lot of careful planning but we understand the excitement and the anticipation and are working hard to have an application submitted so we have a a goal to have the rebates available much sooner um they may be available as early as mid 2024 next slide please all right and another another little uh background on um some common confusion that comes up the rebates are not the same as tax credits so um unlike the Home Efficiency or home Energy rebates um the energy efficient home improvement credit is available this tax year through the IRS so the the home Energy rebates will be administered at the state level whereas tax credits are administered by the IRS um rebates are going to be a reimbursement or will provide a cost discount for eligible upgrades whereas these tax credits you can do um with your with your tax return um and you'll see on the right hand side of the screen there some of the some of the components and some links that you can utilize to get more information on those tax credits available through the IRS um we I should mention are not tax professionals at Odo so you'll have to speak with a licensed tax professional to inquire about these tax credits next slide please all right now these are going to be some of the programs that we have working together here at the Oregon Department of energy we we are involved in a number of different um home energy programs and we're preparing for the Energy rebates by aligning our program goals and policies from several different complimentary programs so the two that we're talking about today are going to be the homes and here programs which are the the two Federal grant programs that can help you upgrade your home and appliances with the energy saving Technologies those programs are going to be supported by the um the Trek that you see there which is an acronym for another Federal program that we're working on um for the um residential um electrif electrification contractors um these are um these are grants that will be coming to Oregon um and will utilize this funding to provide subg grants to existing programs in our state to educate and train new and existing workers such as electricians and plumbers name a few on Energy Efficiency Technologies so this will help to ensure that Oregon is prepared with a qualified Workforce to implement the upgrades and appliances in the rebate programs um we also have a state funded program um that we internally like to call the One-Stop shop the legislature recognized the need to streamline the approach to connect oregonians with available funds for energy related projects with HB 3166 which they passed in the 2023 legislative session um the bill tasks Oda with creating a single resource that oregonians can use to navigate the variety of incentives and reates available to them this One-Stop shop is directed to provide information technical assistance and assistance in identifying contractors and financing options related to energy efficiency incentives and programs um other state funded programs that we have going on there's a lot more here but um one of them is going to be our heat pump programs we actually have two state-funded heat pump programs one is the community heat pump deployment program which is implemented by Regional partners and is um a $10 million program offering incentiv to support heat pump installations for homeowners the second is our Oregon Rental home heat pump program which is going to be$ 15 million and it's implemented by the Oregon Department of energy and supporting heat pump installations in rental homes all right next slide please so you'll hear us talk a little bit today about justice 40 and um I wanted to give you a little bit of background of what justice 40 actually is if you if you aren't familiar with it on January 27th 2021 President Biden signed executive order 14008 which set forth prioritizing actions to tackle the climate crisis included was the justice 40 initiative which directs that 40% of the benefits of certain federal Investments flow to communities that are marginalized underserved and overburdened the home Energy rebates are programs covered under the justice 40 initiative and it's oo's intent to achieve those goals with these rebates in Oregon um excuse me the Council on Environmental Quality was tasked by the White House with defining disadvantaged communities they used a number of data sets to show the communities that are most overburdened and underserved in the following categories fossil dependence energy burden environment environmental and climate hazards and socioeconomic vulnerabilities um some examples include housing and energy costs low income lack of",

area and those folks are going to be challenged with the cost of new product here too so i really think there needs to be consideration on that incentive there how do you help those folks come back into our communities you know seniors are important uh the vulnerable folks are important in our community there too so i think there needs to be a delta there that's a larger delta than just a regular you know working citizen that can you know afford a home there or something great for that thank you so much christy go ahead oh i was just gonna say thank you for the feedback i think you're certainly right uh providing some technical support or trying to educate uh whether it is the building industry or park owners uh i think those are good points and we can certainly work with um existing teams that i know housing community services has been working with park owners and negotiating um some of that revitalization and certainly us being at the table maybe can help with that and try to sell them on the affordability gains and uh and quality of life improvements and investing in energy efficiency um i think those those are all excellent ideas and we certainly appreciate it great thank you so much john for sharing your perspective we've heard really good things about what the cities and counties are doing in southern oregon work work you're all doing together um we do i do have one quick note for david we've had a request for your contact information in the q a if you're willing to put your email address there for kailani and then doug you are unmuted and it can go ahead whenever you're ready yes um my name is doug mcmillan and i'm a resident of jackson county who lost a manufactured home in the almeida and um i feel i'm a fairly resourceful person i work with the zone captains down here in jackson county um my question to both well to the energy trust since that's who we're talking to and are to energy department and energy trust is um i have been looking for resources well let me say that i am a senior on a fixed income who is i put a down payment on a home which is tentatively going to be delivered in about and and i'm curious because i'm very interested in getting solar put into my home which will in the long run help me afford to be able to live there um southern oregon has plenty of sun and i think that there should be ways that we can uh utilize that sun and take advantage of it so i guess my question is are there going to be or are there incentives grants land or rebates to help someone like me acquire um a living environment where i can sleep at night well thank you so much for being here today and for sharing your experience and um we're also sorry to hear that you've had to go through this of course the good news is that our agency does have a solar rebate program it's called the oregon solar and storage rebate program it's open now and it's accepting reservations and you can get rebates for solar and so um you can if you google oregon solar rebate it actually pops up because that's usually how i find it but you go through a contractor um and so you there's an approved contractors list on there but i also know that we'll get your email address from you being on the call today so i can follow up with you after this call make it easier for you to connect with the right information yeah that would be terrific because i keep seeing things like popping up on um like i like to call fake news fake book i mean facebook and they want all kinds of information when you click on their on their thing and i'm very leery on handing out information um on that platform so um this would be if people like me could have access to um to something that we know is secure and safe for us to put our information into so i would really appreciate a follow-up and an email and um i'd just like to give a shout out to people um that are in the state um and uh kaelani and um and also um oh what's your name now i feel like i'm embarrassed the one that's doing the incentive program for the replacement of manufactured homes um i'd just like to give a a big warm thanks thank a shout out to them because they have been helpful to myself and many other people down here in southern um in our rebuilding process so and thank you guys for having this forum yeah thank you thank you so much and i will follow up and um i'll also see about energy trust of organ that might also be a resource for you so okay stay tuned i'll get in touch all right thank thanks doug i think we ended up with another question for david heslam in the q a so david just go for it like our q a is your q a hopefully people can see it when they look in the q a and if not maybe somebody can raise their hand and let us know that that's not not working sorry i was i wasn't paying attention to everything that was in the queue and hey oh it's okay somebody wants to know them you'll have to look you can look there's a question about the um column program from michael mortar i'll let you see if you can um take a look and then come back to you in a minute or something or i guess i could just ask you because maybe you i don't see it for some reason i'm not sure okay maybe just i can see it uh so so michael morter who works for the state and is like one of the leading people doing recovery work in the state so thanks michael for your efforts he says great input from david hesslin one question are the low interest on qual loans available for manufactured homeowners who are renting space that needs honestly like that needs more follow-up i know that mark wyman over at energy trust was examining this issue more closely and i'd like to follow up with him on that and i also know that there's you know specifics around the title and when it comes uh to running that and so because i noted that somebody else did talk about how most of the losses were or if not all the houses were in manufactured home parks where people are renting space i need to i need to double check on that before i can provide more sorry i didn't i can't answer that immediately great i'll do an introduction to the two of you at some point in the next 24 hours or so and you guys can keep chatting that'd be great thank you yeah no problem thank you both all right anyone else anyone else with comments questions things they want us to know uh chandelle i'm gonna un mute you and then you are you should be able to chat now thank you my name is chandell clark and i'm the planning manager down here for jackson and thank you for having this forum um super informational i just had uh kind of a quick question uh we said that we're partnering uh you're partnering with the counties and i was just wondering does that entail the counties providing the grant applications to the individual applicants or would they contact your agency directly that's a great question thank you shandel so we would like to work with and i see andy bolton's coming on uh so ideally we would like to to work with dcbs and have say a combined application have a single application that people can use we we really want to focus on uh having a very simple process as andy was pointing out earlier and try to make it as easy as possible uh where we we asked some questions so we could be good financial stewards but also we don't want to make this a barrier so how simple and smooth can we make this process and we would like to work with counties and see if they can take in those those and but if we need to create an online way for people to apply that works great for us too we want to create multiple ways that that people can apply for these incentives and try to help different communities certainly what we've heard is that different apps different application means uh work for different people and so uh we're trying to create as many opportunities as we can whether it has to be a paper application or something digital online that people can sign up for but we certainly recommend or i guess we'd appreciate any recommendations you have or experience you have in what would work well with great great thank you so much great thank you so much anyone else have anything i got the note i see the note from marsh about also including you in that conversation with michael and david so i'll make that happen um alessandra de la torre who's given us some great advice already we'd love to hear more from you thanks ali you should be ready you should be able to talk hi can you hear me yes we can thank you yeah thank you all so much for holding this and these are really good questions to think about i was thinking about number five for when filling out an application when things make it convenient and something that sometimes happens especially online is that some important pieces are left specifically when people are putting links um to one pagers or to just the webpage being in spanish but then having links that only go to pages with information that are in and um and so sometimes it's it's even just helpful to put little parentheses if those pages aren't available in spanish um or other languages to just put like solo in english like only in spanish or only in english just so people know that when they're clicking on it um that it will be in english only and then also thinking about that same process for signing up or enrolling sometimes those pages are also left only in english and even like getting a confirmation is in english so things that have happened before with other applications is that people apply and then have no idea if it actually went through or you know of what you know who to contact or you know if if they did it correctly right and so just those little things that sometimes could be missed when trying to like fully make this accessible for for community members thank you thank you so much and this is something we've been talking a lot about we've been really inspired by representative marsh live spanish translation for her events and all and doing other things like that and we're going to",

transcription of what was mentioned today thank you very much good afternoon My name is Giovana Casas and I am here to share my father's story Adam houses a man who lives in Salem who has been part of the community since 87 when he went to live on the Mexico City after many challenges and with very little money he decided to start his small business and found a small place to open your business where rented for 20 years 2s years after my father decided that he had to invest in a well commercial eh that was in Silverton Road a person of property roots told him that he could use it as a mechanical store and we trust we saw that there were individuals without street that lived at the entrance eh windows were broken you had to paint and it didn't matter because it's sera the dream to finally buy something of ours however 8 months after purchasing that property notified the city that this uh land couldn't operate like a mechanic shop without a permit and that was a total surprise eh he never mentioned us nothing the real estate people have this business eh it's not easy my dad I never knew we had to move sell the property that we were going to tell the bank and that caused stress to the family to my father ory that my dad he had just invested all his savings life on this property I went to City Hall to look for answers and I didn't understand the magnitude of this until they told me If this is not approved your dad is going to have to go somewhere else to put your mechanical workshop How can I tell you about my dad had enough of that eh I already knew what he was going to tell me this was too good to be true Yovana I knew we couldn't do it only that we required the need for a expert and we found Britney Britney has been helping us to obtain the permissions we require however we saw that the city has proposed 12 conditions of approval and those conditions If they are imposed they will have lasting and severe consequences on the operation of my father's business that huh has been in existence for over 22 years and I am asking please help him my dad's business to continue operating at this location in the years my dad has provided opportunities from work has paid his taxes helped the Salem community and those approval conditions have very serious consequences in business of my father and in the years has provided opportunities for work and has done a job wonderful has helped his clients and We appreciate your time.

        "text": " so um we H got together with Kimber Le Fitzgerald kind of early in the process um and she made some recommendations um she reviewed um the package that I shared with Chris and I think he shared sh with all of you with the pictures and um didn't see any red flags um she recommended that we um meet with the kando neighborhood association which we are in or part of and we have um we're going to present in February to them to bring them on board and in the loop and try and get some letters of recommendation prior to our official application with the city because you are a historically Mark right has to go through their their board yeah that and also the sign um people for the city um we're we have a meeting set up um this month with Main Street Association so we're really trying to um share our vision with a lot of people that might be able to put in a good word and say we think this is a great idea um and then apply to historic landmarks after that um I couldn't open I saw that you had put a packaging with feates I couldn't get that it's probably my I have a m okay but are there any other historic theaters like in Oregon that have L I was trying to like I quickly I believe the um just did it in the last couple years okay yeah because it's not you know safe to be up on the lad yeah you did a good job of describing how like safe and the weather and getting the letters spelled right all the things yeah and in that packet um there was a photo from the early 1930s that had um reader boards all the way across on both sides side in to the left and the right of the elore and we're proposing um s here a much smaller um sign one on the left and one on the right and then one on the far end um that is angled so that traffic could see it as they're headed south on High Street and there's um other plans um beyond the mares that are part of this project um you'll see our rooftop Crown is no longer there because it it rotted out and we had to take it down for safety um and then we want to also replace the blade sign that was blown down in the Columbus Day storm and never so is it garage no not that one Scott smatter want to comment that you really appreciate the reference to the Americans for art surveys and the applications oh very good thank you there's no questions or comments and if you notice in the upper right hand corner there's the activities that are taking place at the Elon AR in the next two that TR we've had lots of ballerinas ballet schools I saw the TU Christmas was there but it said the third annual tub of Christmas I was like they've been doing that for years why is it just the third annual where did you read that it's third annual it it must been like a social media popup there's there it's not like the four millionth annual there were some some social media posts that reference stuff from like 10 years ago so we had that problem always come to the Elenor theater website directly as I also recommend going through other directly next up is the AL for Museum of Arts they're requesting anniversary this all any questions from the board members I have a snarky comment in here about word count however you your writing is very good it's just there's all of us are writing a lot these days uh I did notice you talk a lot about your fabulous and very very diverse collection how's your audience is your audience going more um that's hard to that's hard to tell I you know we don't don't keep um racial demographic so um I mean I would say I mean I would say to an extent you know it has we're um this I mean this coming winter we're partnering with a new initiative in Salem called living Studios which works with neurodivergent artists and we're we're right after the first of the year we're opening a new exud called singular Visions on sellout artists permit collection and in conjunction with that we're we're sponsoring two workshops one on February 28th and one on March 2nd where living Studio artists will be um in the lobby um creating artwork people can come in um you know and make artwork themselves or talk with you know the artists about living studio so we're you know trying to reach out um to that Community we're also um we're we're in the process of going through a strategic process and uh you know one of the objectives is you know how do we engage know other audiences in um SE Marian County it's a large Hispanic population here we've that to a certain extent with specific exhibitions but how do we do you know how do we continue to engage with audiences on on regular to on basis so um hopefully by this time next year we'll have a really nice strategic plan sh we've done we've done a good job in terms of reaching out to the native communi um last fall well we have we we installed the welcome figure Bobby Mercier Grand Carver created a welcome figure for the lobby and and every fall we do a of that grand Rod slats in that so and I think it's a common I mean a lot of a lot of our tra more traditional cultural sites have catered to the population that was here previously and it's changing and getting younger like how are we responding to that exactly yeah are there any Expeditions coming up during this period of time that you're particularly excited for oh my gosh um oh boy I mean there you know there we've got we've got a couple that that I'm pretty ex pretty excited about cular Visions uh coming up reparing that with an exhibit um of a mon mixed media artist Boulder is a 25 year refective exp his his work deals with um his experiences as as an imigrant 1950 his work is bright colorful and provides um painting neon found objects that's be pretty exciting exhibition yeah so Scott spanner had a question so for but so his comment is you know budgeting for lower dollar amount what is happening in 24 that isn't happening in 23 what talking about our budget yeah the budgeting our budget is really dictated by um by the projects we do so we um we have a very stable operating budget we generate um about 80% of our operating budget from earned and contributed sources so endowment fund you know grants to contributions submission fees um memberships store sales U but it it fluctuates from year the year so that um last year 20 2022 20 23 we had some fairly um high priced exhibitions and so our operating budget you know was up closer over a million dollars coming year is not quite as expensive so it's dropped down we have a um we have certain Baseline budget and we have um we have endowment funds we have restricted funds that we use to help support those projects so um one year we might have a $100,000 exhibition and next year that time slot it might be 15,000 so just you know um but at the end of the day we you know we always try to end up with balance P yes so understanding quickly it varies depending on what exhibitions you're putting on is that correct exactly it's all it's all exibition yeah it's good job thank you other questions or comments all right hearing none I guess we'll move on to the next one so this is the Oregon state fair grounds and Exposition Center they have a capital Improvement request for an electronic reader board asking for a Grant matching Grant $2,000 um do we have representatives from the Oregon State thank you for being here any questions from the board members um and I was just trying to I can't BR up y bu I could figure out how much the actual read report cost you had a lot of cost surrounded installing and things like that I see what the reort so one of the bids are the one that's actually on the the application was $3,985 for the reader board itself it's it would be a double-sided board and they they actually had a a corrected sheet get to you okay that's okay I'll try to remember some that later this yeah Scott SN want to comment that quot excited to be part to be partnering with a great extension of the many activities that bring people to sale so comment from no comments questions is is the the state fair a yeah they have a lease on the fair grounds they operate oh okay we're a public Corporation many people don't know um we are a public corporation as of 2015 okay so we are self-funded the state of Oregon owns our grounds 185 acres in all of the building but we are responsible for the care and the upkeep of all the whole inch lot so it has changed and we don't have a requirement that the cips only come from our funded operators it should be if it is a facility has to be a major tourist attraction within City but not they don't have to okay coms uh s Mar Association had a meeting conflict they have their board meeting tonight so they won't be here to us we'll review this one next meetings uh next up is uh Salem Multicultural Institute they're applying for the annual facility Grant operator Grant and then the event grant for the world week Festival questions for Kathleen budget question of course so I noticed that uh and this is my now my other Excel files went open but my question was plan for significant Revenue increases question mark so that either means you have a plan for sure have significant Revenant increases um for for the organization or for the event I haven't under my uh for the organization um we I think we're gonna be flat this year we're working really hard um to make our ticketing for the for the festival which turn supports the event upate for the festival a little more streamlined and a little um more collectible shall we say and ticket uh Revenue went up a lot in 2024 it went to about 50,000 the p is 70,000 this year which was great because most people get into the festivals a lot of them get in for free we said have a lot of passes to places like house um free entries but um so that's what we're working on and more and some different capacity will be okay so just like curios you tell me a little more about how your ticketing system works and kind of the issues we're having well we don't like to put",

        "text": " i'm not sure about one of the shareholders of um the owners of cunningham sheep has a relationship with and then i think the farm to the let's see to the east of us is they also have a renewable wind energy already permitted on that farm as well it would just uh a transmission line of um you know once one goes through if there was more needed it would really um the current and long-term use that is currently permitted um on our farm and then also one other thing i was going to ask was that if um it is cited that i think that they had mentioned that they were going to use the current polls that were there there are single polls but we would just ask if they continue to maintain a monopole structure for a 230 kb line transmission and then i have real reservations about the the use of the uec easements ubc is a very old in our area and oftentimes those easements are blanket easements they're often very wide and broad sweeping um easements and this would be i would imagine at this point in time um it would be a very outdated practice if not obsolete and so i have real um i would request uh hesitation to utilize these types of easements i guess they would need new easements okay thank you stacy was that everything you wanted to cover and just remind me again how do you say your last name it's echeveria and i'm with elh llc and my name is dixie dixie and um would you like can you provide a phone number sorry an email address or a mailing address for us um you guys have a mailing address for that's how we were notified of this through elh llc and then i have also emailed comments to mrs sloane kathleen do you have what you need for that or do you need it again i am not sure i received her email i do not recall it i can check and see it was sent today and it uh would have been from columbia theaters at yahoo okay i can look at myself one more time can you just so we make sure that you get what you need can you just state your at your email address

miss shabaria all right is there anyone else on webex who wants to provide comments uh if so you can raise your hand so i think we were going through here if you're on webex the bottom right side of your screen there's a little um looks like the top half of a person with three lines that's your participant if you click on that that'll open up the and then at the bottom part of the participant panel there's a little hand and that's how you raise your hand so i don't see any other hands raised nancy are you seeing any oh i see no hands all right is there anybody on the phone who uh wants to provide any comments can they unmute themselves nancy if they're on the phone or how how do they do that um i would have to unmute them but i do not see anybody i don't see anybody can they raise their hand if they're on the phone or um they actually need to press star 3 on their telephone keypad to raise their and they can press star 3 again to lower their hand so if there's anybody on the phone who wants to make a comment press star 3 i'm gonna wait just a couple moments to let anybody do that who needs to okay i'm not seeing any hands all right well i've seen no hands go up for any other comments on webex or by i just want to do one final call if anyone wants to make a comment at this point in person or by phone or webex this is your opportunity to do so uh so i need you to make yourself known all right then so does the council have anyone with counsel have any questions or comments they want to make at this point for to the applicant or at all any anything you want to put on the record for this this is hanley jenkins council did you get that kate no i heard i heard a name i heard mr jenkins but i didn't catch anything else my organization is the energy facility citing council and i'm a council member and my name is h-a-n-l-e-y jenkins-j-e-n-k-i-n-s do you need anything else on that do you have any comments you want to put on the record i do rather lengthy list um and for the benefit of those that have a copy of the draft proposed order i'm going to go through that kind of by page to my comments got something some questions here so let me pause for a second and see if are we good oh okay okay so my first comment is on page 25 which is under the balancing issue that has been raised in the i do agree um with the staff that the applicant has met the criteria for the balancing authority primarily because the two turbines that would be affected by the washington ground squirrel habitat represent only one percent of the generating capacity for the wind farm and so i in that case i do agree with staff on that particular issue on page the um there's a i and this is an issue that i think we can resolve with the staff but there's a reference to a facility manager or managers versus operation manager and i think it's the same same person or persons but it's two different terms and i didn't see any definition or reference to the distinction to those i'm on page 37 is a reference to an on-site batch plant and that the on-site batch plant would need a deq permit but there's no indication that the on-site batch plant would need a county land use permit and we kind of we talked a little bit about that today i don't know whether there's a resolution of that but it's something that probably ought to be addressed in the draft proposed order page 44 there's a discussion about let me go to that page it's the issue is subsidence um and um there is a discussion about non seismic related causes to subsidence um there's a geotechnical investigation that's required but the geotechnical investigation only talks about doing the seismic issues associated with some sightings and it doesn't talk about non-subsidence so they're a look at whether or not you need to include non-subsidence in that particular condition there's the discussion about the county's requirement for a two-mile setback from residences the the staff has had a rather extensive discussion substantive criteria associated with statewide planning goals and whether or not the county's two mile setback meets that requirement um and i think the the telling focus of that for me was that the department therefore recommends council conclude that while criteria number three um which is the two-mile is both allowed by and consistent with goal three it's it is nevertheless not required by goal three and i agree with that um uh this is a kind of a unusual situation where the county has adopted a standard that is greater than what is required by oregon land use requirements and it may be allowed but it's not something that's required and it's not a substantive criteria and therefore is not i i agree is not a requirement for the site certificate so that gets me to the issue um focused on in his testimony which is the goal three exceptions process um and that begins on page 114 and the in the rule and i'm going to go through some factual things that i agree with and then i want to get to kind of the crux to where i'm at on this issue so i agree there's 242 acres of high value farm land associated with the solar site so this is in reference to on the solar facility and there's a hundred 840 acres of arable land which has been cultivated in the past and it represents 37.8 or about 38 percent of the land owners in their ownership which i think is fairly significant and so i think that's important to that this area proposed for the solar facility does represent a large portion of what is cropland on the applicant's i accept that it's not irrigated nor in an irrigation district this year it isn't even cropped but it is arable land by definition and it has been cropped in the past i accept that the solar facility would not impact adjacent agricultural operations we have testimony from adjacent landowners as well as the landowner that owns surrounding property to the proposed solar facility and on our tour today i did observe that most of that land around there is either cropland or its rangeland and i accept that there are financial benefits to the landowner that could be used to enhance other on-farm agricultural operations i think you know that's important um but it i don't think in it in of itself is a basis for the exception not sure that we want to be in the business of telling the county how to spend their sip funds to assure local agricultural economic benefits from those funds the applicant alleges this site would have the least impact on other on property cultivated agricultural uses there are no identified alternatives in the analysis area nor is one required by the fsac rules the applicant alleges the solar facility allows for integration with the wind facility but hasn't guaranteed that and the staff's made that clear in this in the draft proposed order and the applicant alleges this site would have minimal other environmental impacts that may be less than other portions of the subject property but it still will have environmental for this particular site the point that i've made over the last several meetings about taking an exception to agricultural lands that um this particular site in fact cult cultivated agricultural land or has been cultivated agricultural land and qualifies um as arable land under the land conservation delta commission administrative rules we are taking an exception to statewide planning goal three through this process specifically for this 2000 acres and i think that's the point that i've been trying to make is why is this particular portion of property different than other cultivated property in umatilla county and central oregon and tim uses the word unique i don't think it's one of a kind i think exceptions process could be met on other properties but i do think that the reasons that are necessary for justifying the exceptions have to be specific to this particular property i don't think",

        "text": ", and then the capacity is not even being used. So basically, we're asking that you help us work this out with the utility department and to come up with a reasonable amount based on actual usage. And I put down this last page of our brochure. There are four locations in Marion county and basically all four locations, the monthly average daily usage and the ranges from basically a little over 800 to a little over 1100 at all four locations. Now, the utility department, their hands are tied. I think they're based on what the state code says. Now, if you really enforce the state code, by the way it's being interpreted, which is based on peak demand. If you look, the average household in Florida, in America uses about 300 gallons of water a day. And if you base the average household of basically four people on their 300 gallons a day on their peak usage, and apply that same factor, you know, that's being applied to us, the tap fee for an average household would be more than twice what they're actually using. And the point is that the average household, they don't use their water steadily over a 24 hours period. You know, they have some peak demand and so, you know, we have some ups and downs during the day, we have a busy time at breakfast, and hope, hope you guys will come meet with us. I can't believe you didn't bring us any smothered and covered hash browns or anything. We can, we can work that out, but basically, you know, our actual usage, we would like for our tap fees to be based on our actual usage. And I know you have to have a code because different types of concepts come in and they. How do you know how much water they use? Well, we have four existing locations in Marion county, we have 2000 locations across the country. We can show you what our usage is, and we are asking that our fees be based on reality, not on a formula that doesn't work for us. So, can I answer any questions for you? Yeah, hold on just a minute. Moneer, in our meeting yesterday, are you required to take the average or whatever the gallons that the state estimates, commissioner, as opposed to actual gallons used? There is a table for all different land uses and what the average use of those different land uses in the state law, and that's what the county adopted in our ordinance. I mean, I can have Jody and Angel, probably they would speak about this in a lot more details I have been exploring with Mister Minter. Do we have any avenue in place to be able to use a different calculation method based on actual data, local data, but we don't have that in our code. So Jody, ordinance, there's no appeal process, you want to speak to that, there's no waiver wave the code, because there is no option in the ordinance. That's the condition. So the ordinance requires us to follow the table? No, the ordinance doesn't require us to follow the table, but in fact we adopted the table. So these kinds of regulations establishing sewer rates, water rates, cap charges in general, the law is that whatever the local government adopts are presumed valid. I put in front of all of you the state regulation, and on the second page it references the restaurant operating more than 16 hours per day, per seat, 60 gallons per day. So that's the state administrative code rule, and that's what we have adopted. We didn't have to adopt that, but that is in fact what we adopted. So any particular utility user could say, well, I use less than your adopted charges. Anybody could say that in the case of Waffle House, they provided information regarding their usages in their other stores in Marion county. But right now, our code doesn't provide for any waiver. So we don't have any opportunity for anyone, not just Waffle House, but anyone currently, to come before the board and say, why, I don't like that. I want to pay something different. Some local governments do have provisions in their codes to provide for a developer or property owner, commercial property owner, to come in and, and demonstrate by their own. Oftentimes it's a separate engineer study to demonstrate what the actual usage would be. We don't have that in our code right now. How long would it take to, if we wanted to change the code, how long? What's the process length of time for that? You have a comment? Yeah, for the record, Jody Kirkman utilities director that would require multiple public hearings. We just went through the land development code revisions with the land development the committee. It took us probably about a year to go through and do that process. That's ridiculous. I also want to point out with what the county attorney provided to you, which is 64 e 6.008, the system sized determinations. If you look on one a where it says the DOH, in that case, Department of Health. And again, this goes back to the supporting table. They said that they will accept other things except for residential and food operations. So they actually set up a way to do this. But again, they did. They discounted residential and food operations, period, from the table. So even the state, when they sized these systems said, no food operations will follow. Mister chair. Yeah. I think we need a revision to the ordinance. Whether or not you're going to benefit quickly or not, I still think that we need to look at that and we need to be cognizant of true usage that has been demonstrated, whether it be through an engineer. Historical data. The Waffle house does have longstanding historical data that they can provide for us. So using that as an example, I think that needs to be in our ordinance. I agree. Now, again, the language is here is not bad. So with that direction, I mean, you can kind of see that geographical area, you know, where it's supporting, because I can tell you this area versus the one that was permitted back in 2018 2019 on maricamp versus 295th night and day, night and day. As far as the potential that that system would actually place demand on our utility system, we don't have to wait to them. Sure. Yeah. What do you mean by that? Yeah. I don't understand. Well, again, you have more residential homes, you have multifamily homes, you have a lot more business potential at that location than you do at Maricam. That's what I'm saying. So can I ask you a question, Jody? Even if we did it based on a group of restaurants, and they could probably, because of their size, they could probably provide us with even larger data, but wouldn't it be fair just to say, hey, listen, we'll go with your assumption. Right? Because you could show me four, five, six restaurants. We go with your assumption that it's 1108, hundred, 900, whatever it is, a day. Right. That makes sense. You go with that and you say, okay, but for the first three years, we're going to run this and then we're going to take the second and third year because you get the first year out of the way with all the glitches that'll be, and say, okay, based on that 24, if there's any additional usage trend on this one particular restaurant, we're going to come back and charge you a cap fee for that. I think you could do that in a way that still captures it and make sure we keep our utility whole because that matters, right? It does. I think the more solid approach is probably charge the higher number, look at it over a period of time. If it doesn't hit that, then you refund the money and that at least protects the utility again. And I'm just trying to protect the utility. No, no, I certainly understand your perspective. And they're reserving that capacity. You know, I mean, you can see the one store down there on 484 because of, probably because of I, 75 does a higher volume, does a little more. But I mean, it's only a couple hundred gallons a day, you know, and it, I don't, I just don't, I don't know why we can't have that flexibility to look at it either way. And what did we, I was just trying to look here. What did we charge them for Mary Camp then? Well, Mary Camp was based on fixture units, so it's definitely night and day as far as. So what's the difference? Like, how do we get here where we're at today? Well, what's the difference? Well, the fixture units were in the code before, in the 2018 2019 period up until that time. Okay. There was changes made in the code, the land development code, that. When did we make those changes? When did we make them? Yes, sir, it was in 2018. And the changes were made because we received some complaints about the fixture calculation. Yeah, exactly. Well, I mean, no matter what calculation you have, you're gonna receive complaints, right? I mean, it probably doesn't matter. Is one more true to actual flows than others? I don't have that information and I've not dove into that. Mister Williams, mister chair. Thank you Mister commissioners I have or commissioners I have three points to make based on the discussion that's taking place. So at Mary Camp Road, again we were with the fixture count, I think the projection was 3000 gallons a day. Using similar data we were able to convince the utility department at that time to use basically a count that would have been 1050 gallons",

        "text": " right location next to an existing proposed wind project and right next to where the battery storage in the substation is and also located close to the north end of the property where it's accessible very quickly if you have problems with the solar it isn't as though you've got to drive the extra 10 or 11 12 miles to get to where the wind may be part of maybe so it does have a uniqueness and importance to us in terms of of how and where we cited it and then in terms of the percentages which i totally agree and i know how you came up with a 36 percent i didn't say anything about it but that calculation is is not applicable here but you haven't been told why it isn't applicable the lands that we already have in crp and i think we refer to them in my but you look at the lanes we have in crp similar to this land where the solar site is going to go they've got to be in the figure but what you're comparing it to is simply apples to oranges the comparison is this 1890 acres to the land that we presently do not have uh ncrp that is cropped so it's a comparison of that figure with a figure of about 2 600 acres and i think you add them together and they'll get 42 or 43 100 acres well that is the 36 percent but the fact is if you take all the other crp that you would have seen out there today the figure really is about is it's around 10 because the fields that you go through where the turbines are going to be is also crp and we've selected those and put them in purposely because of the soil protection and the stewardship that we think is a responsibility just like the government does of society and where we are but if you're comparing growing crop lands now in crp with the site it isn't 36 or 37 it's it's 10 the other thing is that as your vice chair has said is the standard what we are compared to what we have or is the standard what we are compared to what the county has and the county is i mean it's 0.02 or 0.2 or whatever the figure was in your things but very very low percent so anyway this was selected as a site as the very least minimal impact that we could believe was applicable for a solar site which as the members of the ermiston group have said here behind me in the orange shirts this is an important project we think to have done and have i mean it provides everything that we're looking for collectively and it's and it is a project we worked on and and i think it although unique is a term that i guess we can interpret several different ways this is a piece that we think certainly justifies that anyway thank thank you okay mr mcmahon were you gonna make um any other statements no your honor no you're on a thank you we would request a continuance for at least 30 days we'll stick with 30 days we may come back and seek more time but i think that should do the trick thank okay so i was looking at the calendar here 30 days out puts us on a saturday let me see tim mcmahon here let me correct to the next council meeting thank you and let's see next council meeting i know that in your opening you went over that i don't know what that date is could someone remind me june 23rd and 24th so i will leave the record open for the applicant to respond to comments and concerns raised today and to submit those then by the next meeting so it looks like that's starting june 23rd so i'll set the deadline as is june 23rd for applicant to respond okay um i know i've done this several times but i just want to make sure any other comments from anyone questions before we wrap up this evening her honor it looks like uh dixie has her hand up again i'm gonna go ahead and mute her mic if that is good for you okay great thank you dixie your hands up did you have that's in error i have no further comment all right thank you you do have one more comment in the room okay all right um okay uh for the record jody gestle parker uh with the labors local 737 two questions with a uh with a continuance uh can we does that keep the public record comp the comment record open again and i'm seeing the head shaking no in that look and then my second question goes more towards my own testimony can i submit that via email tomorrow when i get tech to find my email program what is it that you want to submit that you haven't told us tonight well no no same uh it's just what i read you got what i s what i spoke to this evening just uh the printed version submit the printed version but my i crashed my email system honestly um and so i have to talk to it to repair it so i can't send it to you today by the close of this meeting do you have a printed copy of it that you could hand over it's flawed i had to line through a couple of things so i could give it to you but if you just excuse the flaws oh i see um kathleen do you have a do you have a preference getting it by email or do you just want to han a hard copy what would your preference be yes what one thing i would want to mention is that we are recording this meaning so your testimony we will have a transcript oh you'll have it on transcript yeah so if there is additional comment that would you did not cover you could give it to us now or we can transcribe your comments oh no that's perfect then if you can transcribe my karma yeah that'll capture it without my scribbles on my paper okay yeah and for the record everybody's comments will be transcribed so okay so thank you so much it sounds like you were able to tell us everything you wanted to yes yes i addressed everything i wanted to talk about i appreciate your time thank you okay perfect thank you okay anything else from anyone uh i'm sorry jody you did ask whether the con the continuance would leave the public record open the answer to that is no it's just i'm only leaving the record open to allow the applicant to respond to things that were raised tonight um and um your honor just uh tim mcmahon here again for um needing some additional clarification on this point there are at least a couple of issues that came up tonight from the council including potentially need to do a county-wide survey um for lands that may or may not need a goal three exception that is not something i've ever considered was a necessity for goal three exception but we may need some time and we may need some expertise as witnesses potentially to deal with that issue and i because this is truly a new twist we're coping with i want to make sure that the record remains sufficiently open for us to potentially bring in some additional witness testimony on this and it may be additional testimony from the land or almost for sure will be frankly but uh but we may very well need some other consulting resources to so are you asking i guess i don't quite understand what you're asking me to do or do you want yeah yeah let me be clear we ask that the record be left open for potential additional testimony and evidence at the continued hearing on june 23rd miss sloan do you have anything you want to add about that or respond to before i take a stab at it all right the record todd cornett i'm going to go patrick rowe doj council make sure he's okay with that patrick the department of justice council has general authority under statute four six nine four seven sub six uh to take any actions that it deems our proper desire desirable for it to carry out its duties so if council believes that for it to ultimately make a decision on this application that it would help to have the additional testimony or evidence that mr mcmahon is referencing then that would be appropriate so mr rowe can i clarify is that something then the council would vote on or that you would need me to make a ruling on i think it would be safe as it it council has delegated its authority to uh conduct this meeting to you but never nevertheless i think it would be safest if council didn't vote on it okay and so the vote then would be whether to allow the record to remain open until june 23rd and then at that meeting take additional testimony from the applicant and you're on if i could say one more thing on this point at this point in time again we've learned new information this evening and were we to proceed without an opportunity to provide this information evidence essentially it's a tantamount to a denial of a very important facility so that is not something we're taking lightly and we need the time to respond okay and does the 30 days or approximately 30 days to the next council meeting give you that time my client says yes i guess i i i would say if we have to come back for a further continuous we can discuss that with mr rowe but i i think that we we should be able to handle this in 30 days so does council want to vote on that i don't know um your procedure for for voting on matters like that so this is hanley and i think patrick suggested it but i don't know that it's necessary i you know it's um your your require your opportunity to allow the continuance and i think that's all that's necessary mr roe were you in agreement or yeah given that council has delegated its authority to conduct this hearing to you council member jenkins is correct i believe you would have you you would have that authority to to grant the request i'm just trying to i just suggested it and an abundance of well let me ask council this is there anyone on council who objects to my um this continuance speak up now anyone um on the phone or webex want to speak up so it doesn't sound like there are any objections to that so what i'll do is i'll grant the continuance to allow um the applicant to respond to comments questions concerns that were raised tonight uh the record will stay open and you can submit those um in writing before that next council meeting or mr mcmahon it sounds",

feedback now and then we'll create draft rules and there'll be another public comment period in january so you haven't completely missed out but the earlier you can get us feedback the earlier we can incorporate it and fit it into total program design and make sure we're meeting people's needs any other questions christy or feedback i don't see anything else i'm happy to stay on the line as we let people go and if anybody wants to raise their hand and ask any questions on the way out feel free work out till five i suppose or until you all leave but we can just hang out and if anybody has any questions the q a or raise your hand otherwise i think we can call it if you'd like thank you everybody for your time thank you for making time to talk to us and provide us feedback it's very valuable um this is mccrae carmichael with um valley council council of governments and the planner for gates um identity in detroit and i missed a little bit maybe 15 minutes or so when you all were getting through some of the nuts and bolts is um i heard you recorded this are you going to have it available on your website like tomorrow or sometime soon yes uh i believe i'll have to check with our i.t staff but i think we will have it up as soon as this week i don't know if it will be exactly tomorrow hopefully by the way end of day but i'll certainly make sure that's available great yeah no i just would before going to the comment portal i want to listen a little bit more think about it um i appreciate all the work teller doing and how this is going to help all the people who are impacted so i'll look forward to talking to you next mcgray did you have any questions or anything come up that that you i could try to address right now no not necessarily i mean i was at detroit city council on last tuesday i guess it was and i was telling them that i had attended the morning session that y'all did last and they were just you know they're eager to learn what it what it's gonna look like and y'all don't know that yet right um but but people are interested so i really and i said this last week i think as streamlined and simple as the application can be for folks um is going to be the most helpful at least for the people i'm working with because they just you know there's a lot that they have to do with all all of the rebuild in the process so people are just ready yeah yeah we actually did talk a little bit about what we do think the program might look like we're still soliciting feedback but i know your last call where we didn't have this slide so michael popped it up if you want to just kind of take a look at it michael i'll let you share whatever you wanted to share sorry i just got excited of course christy uh if you're i guess if the program details if you're thinking of kind of what the incentives amounts would be uh i wanted to kind of show this table uh so you could see that you know there's incentives for if people are rebuilding uh the single-family residential home uh there'd be an incentive just to build the code 3125 if you qualify as a low to moderate income homeowner you can get additional five thousand dollars if you elect to build above code to the reach code or participate in a utility program or um you know like energy trust of oregon or a local local cou above code program there's additional incentives there of 3 and if you are a load of moderate income you can get an additional for that and so then those would all add up you can get those additional incentives and so we're hoping those will add up and be enough that will cover a significant amount of people's upfront cost um and make it so they can take advantage of energy efficiency benefits of building to code or building up of code and it will offer them some of that long-term affordability and hopefully comfort hopefully have a better performing more comfortable home in the end so when you say code you're you're not meeting the 2008 that they can build back to but current current building code yeah i see you saying no i see yes it's in nose yeah okay i just wanted to clarify um i didn't think that so what is above code like reach is that what you're getting at like um not the current code that's in place but even going above and beyond right yes yes so the reach code is a existing building code that is more energy efficient than our current code so it's a a reach or a stretch code that the building convention is created and so people can build to that and counties can can still um qualify it and verify just like if you're building your regular code you just pull a permit so you're building to that reach code and we would incentivize you to do so because it's more energy efficient or you could a lot of utilities have have programs that say hey if you build a more energy efficient new home uh we'll give you x amount of dollars and i andy took us through an example of a um of a home if it was built in jackson county just as an example yeah energy trusts offer some significant incentives to participate in their new homes and so ideally people would be able to take advantage of building to code and then above code and it would offset a significant amount of those costs to do great so um in appliance is it geared at appliances or materials or could it be all sorts of things like that yeah so uh if we just used um energy trust morgan's example it's it's a combination of those things so there's a variety of ways to do it whether it's more insulation or how the house is or more energy efficient appliances or a more energy efficient heating system um it's it's a program and certainly uh we can refer you to energy stress oregon and direct use and they can speak more eloquently about it but it's kind of a comprehensive program where there's a variety of options and ways to get there and they kind of model how energy efficient your home is so um do you see i know we're at five so if people need to hang up that's fine too do you see uh and you could just hang up on me and i have to sit here um do you see people like what would someone say i'm building i'm rebuilding and gates and i want to take this opportunity to use your program how would i then demonstrate to you that that i am eligible like so am i gonna have to do a bunch of paperwork in the front side do you see as part of my building permit or will i get my building permit and i can apply for this grant and i can check some boxes of what i'm doing applies there will be very specific standards and then at the end of construction there would be a verification are those are those kind of a model of how it would work or is that too far down in the weeds at this point to be oh that that's a great question so if you were just building the code uh we're planning on partnering with counties in local jurisdictions so just like when you uh we'll have we'll have applications and this will be for our program as well as dcbs's wildfire hardening program yeah and we'll have an application it'll be a menu of options and saying yes i built the current code i also put fire hardened citing and there'll be incentives for each of those and you would just submit that either a paper copy with your with your building permit when you're submitting it to the county or you can do that digitally online if that's easier for you and we would just take that and and process it and basically let you know send you a note whether email or a letter letting you know hey you know we got your information we're excited to hear you're going to participate um if you are just building to code that's great we actually wouldn't do any verification the county would just do that just because they they normally your plumbing your electrical it'd be the normal process and we'd work with the county to to notify us once you finish a building and you would get that um if you decide to go above code and work with a utility program we would work with that utility on that application and work with them on doing verification so ideally we wouldn't be creating um more paperwork or more verification or more trips out to your property or anything like that we'd be trying to reduce that as much as possible and use some of these existing systems either the county or the utility level have you all um have you all done a program like this with i'm sorry that i'm so marion county centric but that's where i'm at have you done a program like this with marion county before we we haven't luckily we this is uh we haven't had a lot of wildfires to need no but i meant like um some kind of exchange right um not under this but where i'm sitting here and i'm listening and i think oh that sounds really good but i i i the implementation will be a little rocky probably in the beginning right uh so that that's where my brain is thinking like i hear the process that you're talking about but um just getting housed in the right place and within the building department of the public works department at marion county and other government agencies or local agencies or have you even considered doing it through the cities that were impacted or you think the county would be the best because like city of gates and detroit contracts with marion county to do we have an iga with them that they do our building permit reviews but we do our zoning review first so we take in our building permits and issue them i know i'm probably getting into nuances so by all means we can talk about this at another time it's the end of the day um and i can talk with you off but i'm i just i i hear your process and i'm like oh okay i just want to make sure that we can really vet it and get it going like february for folks and not have to what i've seen in the past year and a half is that we have a lot of delays we we just have things that had we been able to talk about him a little",

application shall be granted if all of the following criteria are met number one the proposed use is allowed as a conditional use in the zone number two it's reasonably likely that ad diverse impacts of the use on the immediate neighborhood can be minimized through the imposition of conditions and then the third Criterion the proposed use will be reasonably compatible um with and have minimal impact on the livability or appropriate development of surrounding property um failure to raise an issue accompanied by statements for evidence um sufficient to allow the parties to respond to that issue precludes an appeal to the state land use board of appeals based on that issue um is there any objections um on jurisdictional grounds meaning this is not the appropriate place um for this

thank you now we'll hear from the hello my name is Doug Bogle I am the owner of r13 Street and now I know3 10 Trade Street as well there actually two addresses confusing to me after buying the house not doing that I've wanted live in Oregon since 2009 when I first visited here I fell in love with Oregon and have had family here since the 1800s just visited my great great-grandfather 's buried in Medford was in the Civil War he actually part of the third infantry Calvary and fought for the north though he lived in Arkansas so been poopular came to visit his son and daughter here in 1920 and died and so he he buried here so it was cool to see that grave and know that I had family here before I was ever um I really a couple years ago um I came up I have a wine business in California called winecraft and I was up here looking around and uh trying some Wineries and uh came to Salem and really loved the city L the community started looking for fact just fell up this house it looks like a house that my family had in in La C by The Miracle Mile and I love the fact that it's covered with trees and it's a place that my wife and I plan to hopefully live here maybe not permanently at least parttime um but we have some things to do before that happens far also the fil two places um during covid I I bought my first house in city of Orange at chap University during Co I was job was fur theater all theaters were shut I moved in with my I make payments through short-term airb and compli with City started a short-term rental Association we basically um actually pushed the city to start regulation and make shortterm rental be licensed prated compliance done a really good job got rid of any of the Bad actors that there's usually very few of theman been very successful as far as able to continue to pay my mortgage um uh I've I'm a super host I've been running it out now for a couple years I've had no problems call Orange and check I have five star reviews best reviews you can have as a host of neers in any City can call me if there's any problems and I hope to kind of run this the same way the same rules um we are not exactly sure which platform we ultimately post this on but it's currently listed on Airbnb we did that also for the transparency of this so that way people could see the house and could see the rules and although there's a comment saying that there's there's no rules posted that's not true rules AR posted they have been posted um and our rules are actually probably little more strict than cities you cannot park on the street there's probably Park two in the driveway and Le the least one in the garage and everybody has to do that quiet time for us is going to be 10 pm to 9 am um we also have deciel reader type situation that actually can tell how many can read how many cell phones um we will not have any pars and if something like that were happen is not going to uh airb property manager local airb right away and they have to leave uh property manager will work with anybody they have to includ law enforcement but it will be a problem I didn't put hundreds of thousands of dollars into buying houses contration har the neighood owner before this put a lot of time into it and I respect the work they did and my wife and I have put a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears trying to finish their vision and make it a place that we want to live in that people want to stay we really want to cater to people that are traveling that have pets that gives an option to people with pets we want to provide an option for people that um are staying or or visiting family they need bigger space and it gives them an option to hang out with family and air dinners and celebrate like our one guest did during the holiday that inadvertently happened I didn't know when I list it that it automatically uh allows people to book and because I'm a super host if I cancel it I lose my super hose after two cancellations I talked to the guest seemed like great people they live in Vancouver we visiting their parents they had Christmas um actually was inconvenient for me because I expected to be there at that time so you know my wife and our dogs um so we we want to cater to families visiting families also families visiting students uh students staying at different universities not just CL could be you know of the surrounding universities um Coral you know all over and it just gives an an option for people to hang out with their kids comly kids can stay with them have the siblings um it's great for working professionals as well especially people that depend on their pets was actually placed in the house created a pen pets stairs it's very comfortable the one rule Still Remains that people cannot leave dogs unattended uh shouldn't be any other complaints noise um trying to think what I haven't covered here um we really want to be part of the community I hope to be again up here and be involved probably part of the neighborhood association

        "text": "public hearing about updates to the grid resilience grant program narrative my name is Clay Decker and I'm a senior incentives analyst assign to program today's meeting is to specifically review our proposed changes to the program narrative this is a required step for the annual funding request under our grant agreement with the US Department of energy today's process is separate from the Grant opportunity that just opened last week these edits to the program narrative are connected to Future funding and won't change anything under the current opportunity or application process you'll see that we have several other uh people from the Oregon Department of energy with us today to help answer questions and um I'm going to introduce uh one of them um um because she's our f feral grants officer and she's been with the program uh almost the longest um and that is Emily sary our federal grants officer good morning everybody Emily salary here federal grants officer at Odo been here about a year and um happy to help take any questions um that come up um as clay goes on here right and Rob is not joining us um but he helped design the program and and so he he always helps answer questions and and is still with the program that he wasn't able to attend today and I threw my name up there just so you can see how it's spelled all right uh for those of you who are new to WebEx here's a quick guide for some of the features attendees are off camera and muted but we will unmute you if uh we call on you during the public comment section um you can also

please make sure an email in your comments and we'll have that email uh address posted several times during the during the presentation um and do we have anybody Patricia anybody on um a phone call has anybody in no okay thank you um so I will skip the phone in instructions um today's hearing is being recorded um and then we will post the recording on our website and a list of attendees um also just let everybody know that a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of energy or Odo for short on this slide you see our vision mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission the grid resilience grant program we're discussing today will help Odo support a resilient and affordable Energy we have two objectives for our time together today first we want to make sure that you understand the reasons for the updates to the program narrative and the connection to odo's existing Grant agreement with the US Department of energy this is our part of an annual request for funding as we work to continue to bring federal dollars to Oregon to help make our electric grid more resilient second we'll outline the changes to the narrative and update you on the status of the program and how these Chang es to the narrative fit in we will have time for public comments oh too fast there we'll have time for public comments um and we also hope people will submit written comments to the program email address that's listed there grid. grants energy.org in.gov we're going to have a deadline for those public comments of the 28th but that will also be shown on up on the later slide as well for anyone new to this program I'm going to give a quick summary background uh this grid resilience grant program is funded under the infrastructure investment and jobs act this Federal legislation includes 62 billion with a B for the US Department of energy to deliver a more Equitable and clean energy future for the American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations the grid resilience grant program is just one of the programs that was funded by the iig um and given to the US Department of energy for responsibility for for running um and this particular program comes out of SE setion 40101 D of this law of the IAA the program is outlined by the US Department of energy is to improve the all hazards resilience of the electric grid against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of disruptive events to advance the department of Energy's Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative and to invest in America's and then we have the link here in these slides which will of course be posted later with the with the recording of the presentation um but that shows where you can get to the information specific information about the program and and how Oregon and the organ Department of energy applied for this grant so here's a summary of the funding timeline of the program so far Odo was awarded a grant agreement in June of last year and that included two years of the expected five years of funding these first two years of funds are now available under the opportunity that opened last week with applications due by June 14th our agreement with the United States Department of energy includes a process for annual funding for an annual funding allocation request us doe issued an amendment to the administrative and legal requirements document which said it at line in April for us to submit odo's request for the fiscal year 2024 funds the request process includes the requirement for this public hearing because we have proposed changes to the narrative this is a screenshot of the top page of the narrative document showing our proposed edits this document is posted on our program website in the stakeholder engagement section under the notice for this public hearing new text is shown in red underlying text and deleted text is shown with red and strikethroughs most of the changes were minor to make the text clearer by removing redundant and other unnecessary wording and to remove language that referred unnecessarily to a specific timeline such as during the first year of the program and things like that we've just administratively made edits to make um The Narrative more generic across the life of the program I'm not going to review the entire 12-page document today so if you have not had time to review the change document that's posted please do so and email us with questions and comments by March 28th I'll highlight some of the specific changes the key point we want you to take away today is that there are no major changes from the current narrative and no effect on the current opportunity round that just opened in a couple of places we've strengthened the language of the project metrics we want to see in Project details under our objectives um for the metrics related to mitigating grid disruptions we originally asked for data asking simply for the number of customers affected by the frequency in duration of grid disruptions we added in the requirement to include the percentage of customers affected to give the application reviewers a better picture of the expected results of the project in to the entire Grid or the entire Services of that particular utility that's proposing the project so instead of number we went to number in percentage another another change um most of the metrics under objective three which covers our community benefits are currently worded to measure by awarded projects and so the first two objectives were specific to projects and then we did the third objective saying that we were going to measure it by all the projects awarded and we wanted them to be consistent so we changed the wording um to to talk about to be Project Specific um and then we also rewarded it so that the metrics more closely match the language from the US Department of Energy's guidance for metrics um and that metrics guidance is available on their website too for this program and there's the the listed example of the current and the change um then the sort of the biggest change we did the current narrative had some non-definitive language stating that we anticipate a establishing two vs also known as set asides but as we develop the program and the opportunity announcement and started working on how we're going to review the applications um we found that we could not equitably or confidently measure the percentage of funds being spent in disadvantaged communities over the lifetime of a project from simply looking at the estimates for proposed projects at the time of the application um and so um even though we anticipated establishing this car r we never did um and that information um the information about the benefits to disadvantaged communities will only become clear as projects get implemented and actual funds get spent so we removed that language for the justice 40 carv out because we never did build it into the program um the US Department of energy will measure the justice 40 benefit from data provided during reporting from the awarded projects looking at where and how the funds were spent and then during the application review our objectives and metrics will allow us to rank and compare projects based on their estimated benefits to disadvantaged communities and overall Community benefits provided we then are able to prioritize projects for selection for a ward that demonstrate the greatest environmental justice community benefits paired with the greatest grid disruption benefits so that's what it currently looks like and then this is um after we cleaned it up this is what the the new funding distribution will will look like what remains you'll see is the carve out of 40% for small utilities and here it's actually just a repeat because this was introduced and explained earlier on page four of the narrative um just a quick background there then the um law required for Oregon it would end up being a 25% carve out for small utilities based on percentage of customers but um in speaking with stakeholders and looking at the unique nature of the small Utilities in Oregon it was decided to up that to a 40% carve out for the small utilities um so this is the last sample of the changes we",

        "text": " can certainly give us clarity and guidance but enough specificity so we can actually do that say i'm just and i'm not i'm not picking you we want to do notice that's not good enough frankly it's not good enough you need to be very clear as to when how frequent you know in what form how wide in you know what sort of so the details can be filled up because we can't just sort of generate a concept of a notice out of thin air based on what you're saying this is not a notice that's in our our rules related to property owner notification if it was a property or no notification for a draft proposed order we have that framework set we're all good there you're creating something completely different this was not evaluated during the draft proposed order there was no comments on this so you're creating this out of thin air we need the details and the specificity from you in order to be able to reflect this in a draft of a final order um todd i don't see how we're um creating this from thin air so we have it in the proposed order newspaper one week prior if we say now there's um mail notices one week prior but to whom how in what form who's going to be giving those is that is it the department's responsibility is it the applicant's responsibility what's the nature it does there has to be some specific form to describe again where we have very clear about notification it says when we have to do it how we have to do it clearly what has to be in the notice itself to meet the requirements so just saying that's that's not guidance to us or a construction contractor so if you're saying the same information that's in the notice in the newspaper needs to be put in a property owner and that needs to go out at a minimum of one week prior to all the people on the most recent property owner tax rolls on the county assessor records that's something where we can work with but just simply saying notice again we don't know what that means you have to be specific as to you know what we're talking about here and so it's not creating it out of thin air so that was probably not the right characterization but the the property owner notification does not exist right now and so what your purpose and intent of that is needs to be clear to us sort of sharing how i think as kellen and sarah mentioned there's more detail in the requirements for a blasting plan and if you can direct us to that and see if these issues are already addressed in that very specific plan requirement we won't need to modify if not i agree with cornett that we do need to be very specific in what we're asking the applicant or the applicant's contractor to do and and i think there are good examples out there there's a reference to the blasting code that probably has very specific requirements so i think perhaps tabling this for now so we can do some homework knowing that it's something we may want to add some language on but but being prepared to come back with something more specific so we can move on to other issues as well so again procedurally we did put a placeholder at the very end on wednesday so if there are any unresolved issues like this if you're you know if you're if you think you want to be you can do it but you're not sure of the specifics we do have some time to work that out before the conclusion on thank you and thank you for your council members but where's the council on this ready to punt to wednesday on this issue keep working on it yes so this is hanley do we know the specific specific requirements for the blasting a draft framework blasting plan and we have a table of contents and general information under each of the table of components so it still has to be we have referenced some of the nfpa requirements that were cited to us by dogami as what might apply for monitoring seismic shaking during this isn't a plan designed to demonstrate compliance with all blasting so it doesn't currently detail any of that but those that we thought folded into the structural standard based on our consultation with dogami are referenced yeah i wanted to finish structural standard five before we took a break come back and pick up financial assurance standard one um we're still on it we're still in the structural standard yeah we are done with structural standardize or the the contested case five for the structural standard hd5 so just for clarification everything else in this sorry everything else on the structural is okay yeah so you're good with that in the proposed order it's just the question of the the blasting notification okay so at least again i think with that we have time to you know either you do or we do have the ability to think through that a little bit and have some kind of you know straw proposal for wednesday uh as long as that's the only issue but i'd say if there are other unresolved issues we should continue working through those no i think i think that's as far as this is handling as far as i'm concerned that's the only unresolved issue and and i i do agree with anne's interest in notifying the adjacent landowners or nearby landowners and i understand the department's position that we need to be specific about how we do that or how we recommend we do that it's not you know if it's the same thing as the newspaper notice then is it to the occupants or is it to the land owners and you know and so forth and so on i think we need to be clear about that so i think it's a wednesday issue okay so then i would recommend uh at this point taking a break uh dinner is here so however long council wants to take a break it's it's designed as a working lunch we're already about an hour behind on the schedule for tonight uh for the two or the three issues that we want to get through or three standards that we want to get through so i you know again should take as much break as we need to but shouldn't linger too long since it's already 705. okay and i know that so how long do you want just get it and come back okay take a 15 minute it's 705 so at 7 20 we'll be running again oh no no this is what this is uh and financial assurance standard an issue rfa1 so miss tardy weather you're on thank you vice chair how i'm um looking over at our just waiting for our powerpoint to get queued up for the record calendar weather oregon department of energy so while we're getting the powerpoint queued up in its in its pdf format just kind of talk about um we've we've talked quite a bit about the retirement and financial assurance standard um for for other projects i feel like council is pretty familiar with the standard but i think that this is a good opportunity um to remind council about the interconnectedness in between our our standards um and for part of under retirement we do look to um findings of fact and conclusions of law under the organizational expertise standard and in july we did review the organizing organizational expertise and council um didn't have any uh revisions underneath that standard so just kind of reminding council there we um we kind of looked at that but organizational expertise also has a an aspect that relies on retirement so we're just kind of keeping these in mind you guys working on the powerpoint okay well i i'm just one minute oh it's okay good yeah the one right above that so you're yeah but just the language standard language yes correct um and uh crystal the court reporter are you still with us yes okay great and we'll all try to um speak loudly and enunciate and also talk slow but also fast the council's retirement financial assurance has um two aspects one uh that can the applicant um taking into account mitigation can they ensure that the site would be restored to a useful non-hazardous condition and then the second aspect is that there's reasonable likelihood that uh that the applicant can obtain a bond or a letter of credit in a form and an amount satisfactory to the council to restore the site to that um useful and non-hazardous condition um the applicant um represents that the useful life of the facility is approximately a hundred years this is longer than council sees for some other facilities this is also something that is asked um to be presented in the application that we then you know you rely in our findings so the applicant says that the transmission line would the approximate lifespan is about 100 years but really it expects that it's going to remain in operation functionally in perpetuity um that at the applicant and its parent company idacorp they've been in operation or the company originated in 1915 so we talked about this under the organizational expertise this is a regulated utility in oregon in idaho they all have constructed and operated several transmission lines that have been in the operation in operation for long periods of time and that over time the transmission lines get upgraded and maintained to that uh to where they do have um and can safely operate within these uh longer durations and time spans because that is the transmission structure of our energy system so let me see oh uh the next slide wally or nancy um now no the one with a table on it so maybe the previous one sorry okay we've gone um i have the the table that has the council's used to seeing where we break out and we talk about the tasks of how would this facility be retired and the assumption is that it's full build out can you go to the slide with the table on it i think it's the one right before this yes and that's impossible to see so um you're welcome i can find the i can find the page on your on your proposed order though okay so the this task oh that that that's kind of helpful it breaks out all the line items uh on our retirement when we do the cost estimating to get the estimated bond amount to retire the entire the facility is at full build out so we're maximum footprint maximum everything um it's on your proposed order page 296 this table is so and and it the discussion of the activities to restore the site are kind of reverse construction so we're taking down the poles taking down the cabling removing an efu land the foundations for the transmission structures and all of those get reviewed and a price tag put next to one of the major components for the facility are the related supporting facilities which are the roads or one of them is the roads roads would be",

        "text": " rack would have like the early review for the proposed rules we put it out for the public um and then we'll bring those comments back and Odo will review the comments and then we can also bring those comments to the rack too um for for weighing in on how to address so and certainly welcome rack member comments through the public process too um as a as a separate um if if needed you know a separate opportunity to provide comments but you know definitely want to have that multiple iterative step process through as we go through um and then I think the really only other uh there was an addition about you know committing you know to to provide reasonable access to any underlying data that we have to support summaries reports and determinations so we added that one in there um and then there was also some comments around we had initially proposed just to make have rack meetings focused with rack members but there was some desire to have it um open to public members too so we were um okay with that so we we've gone ahead and just made that change um all the rack meeting links are now published on our Odo rle making website for the public to attend and it seems like it's it's working because we've got a number of public members here today which is great um so all the rack meetings will be open to the public to to view and listen it on and can I ask a question about that I looked last week and I didn't see that or were those was the post late and is the plan to I haven't looked again is the plan to get those up sooner or all kind of up now they they are they are all up now and they've they've actually been on the website for a few weeks but I think the reason where where you may have looked and not seen them um was because we have a we have our building performance standards website and then we have our Ru making website two different pages and they're on the ru making page and they're not on the on the other page we have links to the two but um so sorry for that no that's great thanks for clarifying but they are up on the on the rule making site itself um great so if you for anyone on the call if you do find yourself on our just general BPS page we do have a link to the rule making site on the right and you can click there and see all the all the rack meetings and then once we do have our general public rulemaking meetings too they'll also be up on this page so all the ruem focus meetings will be on the ruem site thank you yeah yeah sorry for that for that confusion um navigating stay websites I know isn't easy sometimes so um okay so I did put a clean version of the charter up on the the rack SharePoint site too so um it's there for reference if anybody um wants to reference it I think it's under this um the BPS rack Charter folder so we got the the draft with the comments that we received and um how we addressed them and then a clean version of the charter up there too where we just accepted all the changes and um got rid of all the any formatting comments and things like that um okay so moving to the next item on the agenda is uh just a quick update on our energy use intensity Target setting request for proposals we have an open request for proposal um that's that's up now it's posted on Oregon buys we had a kind of pre-proposal kickoff question last week we posted it um on April 10th so it's been open for about two weeks it closes on April 29th um we had a a meeting last week a pre-proposal kickoff where uh potential firms could log in and ask questions uh we had a we had a few firms log in which shows I think some interest which was encouraging um that will'll receive some quality proposals for this work but um just to kind of provide an overview for what this RFP is and the scope of work under it um we'll be hiring a consultant to help us analyze data to review data analyze building energy use data across a number of different data sets including um Portland Portland's benchmarking data the national commercial building energy consumption survey Nia's commercial building stock assessment we have some um Oregon state owned building energy use data um and then a few other data sets to help us look at building euis across building occupancy types across our two organ climate zones and determine what is the average energy use intensity for these different building types because if you look back to house build 349 and the the direction it directs us to set energy use targets that are not more stringent than the average energy use type for different building occupancy types um so that's what this effort this work is going to help us do is to look at those the like the energy data building use performance data that we do have develop the average use and then um recommend a methodology to determine what the average ravages are um and then to help us to propose those targets to stakeholders to the rack to stakeholders receive feedback potentially modify the targets based on that feedback and help us kind of bring that eui Target setting effort to the Finish Line throughout our Ru making process this year so we we hope to get proposals on that um as soon as you know by the time it closes next uh I think it closes on Monday next week on the 29th is Monday so um and then we hope to evaluate those proposals over the two weeks following when it closes and then hoping to award that um in late May and have that contractor on board in in late May are there any questions on the scope of that that RFP and the work involved there because that we we do expect that contractor to be uh relatively integrated into future rack meetings um I think we we have attendance at at least two maybe three uh rack meetings um and facilitation of discussion of eui Target setting so did you share the link to the RFP are you able to do that uh I can yeah it's up on um Oregon visis and if it's helpful I can I can just post yeah yeah the um let me just have it up here it is uh I'm not really an expert on procurement in orgon buys So Others May know more about how to actually search for it um like in that in that system but um this is I tried to drop the link in the chat I found it oh awesome you but also want to call out you say proposal due April 26 but on the timeline couple Pages later it does say the 29th so oh it does yeah that is uh that's a good that's a good point I I wonder what it says in Oregon bins um that's something I'll make a note to clarify with our procurement staff we may just have to make sure it stays open as long as people think it's going to stay open great yeah thanks for that note oh someone said there's an addendum for this stating the 29th so it looks like the 29th is the is the date so yeah thanks for that clarification that makes sense we must have I'm guessing our procurement staff noticed the discrepancy and posted that addendum so I might I think I'm just referencing an older version so um okay any other questions on this RFP before we move forward okay thanks um that uh the next item on the agenda is talking about our just general building performance standards uh program schedule so I was just going to show a couple of um Excel charts that we have up on the SharePoint site now um one of them they're under this other references folder so I'll talk just about like the general BPS first and I'll try to make this larger so it's easier to see um so you know the our this year primarily in 20124 is uh Ru making where we have to do initial Ru making for uh tier one building performance standards and for tier 2 energy reporting um we have a report that our agency will need to write in our progress by the first quarter of next year by July of next year we have to notify tier one and tier two building owners and we also have to convene a tier 2 stakeholder group and we've actually already started that process to gather interest in that tier two group because we do want to get some input on tier 2 building requirements as far as just the energy bench marking piece goes that's part of this year's rule making um and then we have this annual report that we need to deliver to the governor and the legislature every in the first quarter of every year on January 15 um we have a report for the incentive program that's due in 2026 and then buildings will need to start complying the tier one buildings would need to start complying in um July of uh 20 or June rather of 28 um for buildings that are 200,000 ft\u00b2 or larger one year later for buildings that are 990,000 ft and larger in June of 2029 and then one year later after that buildings that are 35,000 feet or larger in June of 2030 and then the first year for benchmarking data for tier 2 buildings um will need to report in July of 2028 and then about one year later we will have to evaluate that tier 2 benchmarking data to determine the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions averages uh for those tier two buildings and then about a year after that in October of 2030 provide a report to the governor and the legislature on recommendations for a tier 2 building performance standard so that's kind of the long-term timeline in terms of like rulemaking when buildings will need to start complying when we're going to evaluate tier 2 buildings and a potential building performance standard for those and then I also wanted just to share our draft rul making schedule now so how we kind of Envision going through the different sections of um of the rules and providing those drafts to the rack and then rolling those up for general public meetings so here we are in um you know we had our rack kickoff in February I see make this a little bit bigger um we had our rack kickoff meeting in February in March we held the public meeting to go over building performance standards in general the separate sections of House Bill 349 and then we walked through the ashray standard 100 Target um if folks",

        "text": "-loaded already um now that we're in here you can kind of see the basic layout we've got our map on the right and then we've got our list of data layers on the left and there are a lot of them there are hundreds of data layers in here it's uh the project team spent a lot of time identifying these and sorting through which ones would be you know the most useful for people who are interested in renewable energy siding and which were the reliable sources that we could count on over time um and we'll we'll poke into these a little bit but just you know highlighting the major categories you can see natural resource considerations there's a lot in here Community considerations oh I'll open that up a little bit later um and a lot of other data sets that are in here I want to start with military training areas we mentioned that DOD provided the funding for this tool and when I when I click here what you see in this kind of spaghetti that pops up these are military training routes that are over the state of Oregon most of us probably don't don't realize that they're there but they are in the different colors tell us how low uh plans are allowed to fly basically over the state when I click on one of these layers so I just clicked on this yellow one you get other information that pops up and this is in general how the tool so you can see here it identifies this particular Corridor and it says floor elevation 100 feet that's basically how close to the ground they're allowed to fly and you know it gives you a little idea also why the military was interested then in funding this so in certain areas they're allowed to fly pretty low to the ground renewable energy structures like wind turbines can definitely extend into that air space and so you know the military is interested in you know trying to find ways to reduce potential conflicts that would exist between their uses and renewable energy uses and that's what's being high in their their willingness to fund the tool so let's click off of that one and um the the main thing I want to do here with the demo today is I want to take a look at a project and you know kind of look at one of the use cases for how people might actually use this tool there's different use cases a developer might use it someone in accounting might use it public people members of the public obviously can use it I'm going to look at it from the standpoint of somebody in my department who's reviewing an application that would come to fsac so as I scroll down here in the energy layer you can see there's a layer for the Oregon energy facility citing Council or f-sec facilities so when I click on that those pop up and I'm going to zoom in here a little so we're going to take a closer look at some of these and as we go into the gorge area you can see we get some colorful areas popping up and these are projects that are either under consideration or have been approved by fsec so if I click on one of these you can see the order highlights and we get more information about that project this is the Oregon Trail solar project it's an approved project from fsec and you can do that with any of the one that I want to focus on is actually a little outside of the gorge area it's more in Central Oregon so I'm going to zoom back out and we are going to zoom into the Madras area to look at the solar project that was reviewed by um fairly recently this is the major solar project and you can see as I zoom in here now this project boundary is showing up and I can change the transparency for this layer by clicking the slider that you can see so I'm going to change that a little bit so we can see some of the things that are behind it you know as we look at this and we want to if a project like this comes before fsec the the auto staff will evaluate impacts to things like natural resources including agriculture so if I look at Natural Resources and then I go to the Farmland area and I'm going to start just with this one high value Farm soil so the question a question that could come up are there high value Farm soils in the area of this project where a developer wants to put a solar project so when I click on that layer you can see that sure enough we have high value Farm soils that are in this area so we've established that now another question might be well what's the sort of place associated with those so we can click on that layer and now we can see things get more colorful and you can see for this blue shaded area it says it's Prime Farmland if irrigated now if we wanted to just verify that if I click on that point on the map I get this pop-up and part of this says find data on the map so when I click on the left it says two results found one of those is Farmland soil class and again it says here and just to validate it says Prime Farmland if irrigated when this project was actually evaluated and I just have to look at my notes Here fsec found that it is part of an Irrigation District but it had never been irrigated and been used for agriculture in over 25 years so the council did approve the goal three exception that the developer had requested for this project and issued a site certificate and the project is now in pre-construction so just a little example of how the tool can be used you know by different people for different one other thing that I'd like to show and I'm going to click off this natural area for a minute and look at Community considerations there's a lot of Community Based data in here in EJ environmental justice data so if I take a look for example in this area so there's the EPA EJ screen data in here and under socioeconomic indicators I clicked on demographic index earlier so when I click this section on now you'll see that we get four colors that are popping up and it's telling us that it has demographic index information for here so again if I click on the map in this case right click and again say fine data the demo demographic index data pops up for me we can see you know people of color low income unemployment rate and all this other information that that immediately pops up based on that point I clicked on and the area that it applies to is highlighted here on the map so you know you can get lost in here and and spend a lot of time looking through data to your heart's content I promise we're going to stop with that now and move over to the report section but I think you get you know the idea that there's just a wealth of information here that can be used for a lot of purposes and can be very valuable for renewable energy citing so this point I want to look at one of the other features of the tool which is to get a report so this is more from the standpoint if if you're a developer and you're looking for a project site let's say you're prospecting um you might want to report on a particular site that you're interested in um I'm going to zoom out a little bit for this one not that it matters too I should have clicked that EJ screen off before I did it but uh let's see if I can still get somewhere where I want here let's try to move over to this area this is a fairly undeveloped area and you can see maybe these purple lines these are transmission lines so if I'm going to do development I'm going to want to do it in an area where transmission is nearby so let's get a pop-out name for this we're just going to call it the sunshine solar it's solar what's the maximum height of a structure maybe 25 feet say it's 200 megawatt capacity then I go to the next screen and it says okay do you want to draw a shape go ahead and draw a shape on the map to get your information for so I'm going to do that and I'm just going to make a little polygon here then it asked me do you want to apply a buffer to this area yeah probably you know we want to look at more than just the project area though so when I do that it puts a little buffer around there for me and then I go to the next screen what sections do you want to include in the report do you want to include everything or only intercepted or relevant results well that sounds right to me and then I click next so it can take a few minutes for this to run rather than waiting for that to finish I'm going to turn it back to Ruchi we've got screenshots of a report that she can run you through and make some closing comments to finish up she I'll turn it back to you I'm gonna have you just jumped to slide 21 um and we can always go back to the live demo if people have questions or want to see their favorite you know resource um okay here we go thanks Wally um so as you mentioned all of the data layers that intersect with the project are provided in a report in the tool as well as a single PDF that the user can download save and share with anyone interested in the project the project or the report provides site level Maps links to download data and review metadata along with contact information for potential citing and permitting decisions and this is a screenshot of that PDF that you would be able to just email your friends your family or people you just want to talk to about a project through this project as we mentioned we talked to so many representatives local governments tribal governments and stakeholders across sectors and they helped us figure out you know this is the level of reporting that could support data-driven and productive discussions around renewable energy and that aligns with our goals and the need for a centralized transparent set of information about potential projects earlier in the process next slide please thank you so this is just a list of some additional links um to project resources and we just wanted that for reference you can click on you know I think they'll be posted Zach will I think put them on the the list on the commission website as well and um next slide there's some just a few closing thoughts here you know this was a quick tour and we invite you and others to visit our online tool and report and you know we have we're really proud of the engagement that we've done and but we know there's a lot more people and organizations that could",

        "text": " add that another funding source that is available is c-pace commercial property assessed clean energy it's available in both multnomah and deschutes county and it's a program that any other county could opt into and i don't know if you'd like me to elaborate on it or if you're familiar with it rob but it's certainly something that could be added to this list definitely yeah we would love to add that to the list and maybe if you could give a a very brief you know one minute summary of what the program and we will make sure it gets added to the to the background documents that go into the report i'd be happy to it's a expansion of the federal tax assessment process similar to a local improvement it allows commercial property owners to use the special assessment process to finance renewable energy energy efficiency water conservation ev charging ev charging and backup storage it has popcorn across the country over the last 13 14 years as states in abel see pace and then counties adopted and oregon enabled this program in 2015 multnomah adopted it around 2015 and implemented it in 2018 and deschutes county just implemented it this or well adopted it this uh may and they will implement it in august if you'd like to find out more sure yeah that would be uh that would be and thanks for that summary we'll make sure to get that added to the to the background document um and so that fits into these kind of categories of considering you know policies that are striving to promote project development and um you know we've got these different incentive programs um energy trust of oregon the oregon solar and storage rebate program we have federal incentives like the immense investment tax credit and other federal programs other federal funds that are kind of have yet to be to be determined that are underway right now so i will move on to the next slide here so there's a few additional um opportunity considerations that i wanted to go over briefly these are opportunities that have been developed either by our planning that helped to develop this meeting for us or have just been talked about maybe in the last meeting and this is one of the short lists that we're hoping to expand during this meeting and in the development of the so opportunities that have already been thrown out there one tapping underdeveloped resources like micro hydro geothermal or biomass using renewable energy and storage or other technologies to provide backup power to critical infrastructure and so this is that resilience benefit and i think we're going to see more and more of this helping to drive projects that's certainly a key part of the community renewable energy grant program is to support these community energy resilience projects another opportunity making use of previously disturbed land and combining renewable power with other land uses so this is both looking at brownfields but also if you're developing a renewable energy project consider if there are other uses that the land that's being developed could could be used for so we'll look at a couple of cases like that within our speaker presentations and then finally this one is left a little bit vague but deploying small scale projects within communities where certain additional benefits may be and this one leaves kind of with the dot dot dot for this meeting because it's those benefits and opportunities that we're looking for and anything that we come up with today can be fed into the next workshop which is going to be looking at some benefits and some of the financial you know parts of projects so this is one where we really want to try to explore those additional benefits of these small scale community-based similarly for barrier considerations we've identified some some barriers upfront cost and not just the upfront cost but also the energy sales rate that you get from a utility and the the cost of power relative to lower cost options and one of the things that we've seen is that solar has actually become the lowest cost option and so that has a few not in all cases and not in all hours but what we're seeing is that prices in the middle of the day when solar projects are at their maximum output both have already been reduced and in the future are likely to be reduced even more and so these these um that other projects that are not solar projects like a geothermal project or a biomass project you know how how can those be strategically developed and operated to be providing power maybe during higher energy cost scenarios and just how do we deal with these these lower cost scenarios within the development of the broad you know renewables another barrier is just local opposition or the not in my backyard um folks and this is true of pretty much all energy facilities as well you know solar included wind included certainly coal and natural gas plants and so this is one of those things where again engaging with the local community we believe there's an opportunity for community driven projects to really find that best site for project development and minimize these nimby concerns local staff capacity is one that we've been seeing more and more what we see is there are a lot of communities that would really benefit from a renewable energy or energy resilience project getting those projects developed takes a lot of time takes a lot of staff commitment and resources that may not be present in especially the smallest rural communities across the state and so this barrier is really front and center right now and trying to expand capacity within these rural communities to develop projects and the community renewable energy grant it has planning grants of up to a hundred thousand dollars that are a little lower entry hopefully for communities to be able to start tackling some of these capacity issues that's really just the tip of the iceberg and we really need to figure out how to support these communities that are poised to develop projects another one of the barriers that we've heard from some project developers is wheeling costs and sometimes the wheeling is happening across multiple different lines and can take a significant bite out of the value of the energy that's being provided to the grid that is one where maybe we talk about that a bit more when we have a financial in the next meeting but it's certainly been identified as a barrier by some of the stakeholders all of these issues have led us into a list of of key questions and what i would like to do is just read through these questions we all keep these questions kind of in the back of our head as we go through our presenters today thinking about how some of these questions maybe relate to the projects we're seeing and then think about any additional questions that you think should be on this list and um you know this is again a short we want to expand it oh sorry i thought since you came on screen that you were gonna um christy is keeping tabs on chat and raised hands and all those things that i'm not able to really monitor as we go here so alrighty moving on here is the list of key questions that have been put together in the background some of them are very general and some get to be very specific and so the first one is general what are the barriers to developing small-scale and community-based renewable energy that's really what this workshop is all about in addition to the opportunities what are the policy objectives associated with those barriers and so this is recognizing that barriers in many cases have a very valuable role within the development landscape and that some barriers have very legitimate policy objectives but again maybe some of them are ready for updates and that's where maybe we can come up with some recommendations what are oregon's goals and policies that support small-scale and community-based projects and this is more along the lines of creating this one gets right to the right to the heart of what we're doing here today what policy changes would work group members recommend or both overcoming the barriers and also for creating additional opportunities what barriers exist for projects in the oregon community solar program this one is very specific and we've already heard a little bit about that in our last meeting and hear more about it today what are the market barriers what are the land use barriers what opportunities are unique to small-scale community-based projects and this question will also be asked in the next workshop but in a different way what benefits are unique to small-scale community-based projects and so we find that there's a lot of crossover between these work group sessions and um how do barriers opportunities benefits kind of line up and how do we really distinguish those for this report what is the role of grants and other incentives to overcome financial and finally ending on a positive note what are the most promising opportunities for small-scale community-based renewable energy projects in oregon here is a short list of questions that we are calling kind of crossover questions that maybe we don't tackle at this meeting some of them we've already addressed in the previous meeting or maybe we'll get into in a little more detail in the future meeting one power utility rates both for participating owners of projects but also for non-participants affected by different ownership models so this is a rate impact question um two what specific benefits are attributable only to small-scale community-based projects and this one relates to those specific opportunities that we just saw in the last slide and another rate impact what is the impact to all rate payers associated with overcoming the barriers to these small-scale community-based projects and finally just a general one for the what's the state of small-scale community-based project development in and so we really want to get one answered if we don't know where we are it's harder to know kind of where we're going and so i think we're getting pretty near our time to kick off our presentations our first group is going to be a look at the bowman dam hydroelectric project that actually unfortunately was not a project and so this will be a a look at barriers and we've got um the the team of rock stars from primeval that are have been doing pretty amazing things really they greatly outperform themselves for the size of the city of primeval as far as renewable energy development goes and so we're very happy to have steve effelman who's one of our work group members but also eric klon and steve forrester is steve with us um okay got called away to the sheriff's office another meeting so sorry about that no no that's all right so i'm gonna hand it over to um eric and steve to talk about the bowman hydroelectric project i will continue to advance slides so just give me a note when you're ready for the next slide and we'll we'll kick off we'll kick this off i don't see any hands up",

        "text": " staff are decreasing so as Michael will explain our current SE our our current service level budget includes fewer positions than we currently have because the general funded incentive programs like solar and storage and heat pumps are considered one-time funded programs by legislature this means they don't show up in our 2527 budget so the current service level budget phases out the programs and the staff that run them and we're not proposing to add those programs back to our ARB because they would exceed need that 1% increase to general fund programs that we're allowed so why does this matter to the esa well all of the positions that the agency contribute to our indirect cost pool otherwise known as our administrative overhead with the funding source that supports them with fewer General funded programs contributing to overhead more of that cost falls on Esa funded positions so it's not that we're shifting any positions from general fund to Esa or that we're adding more Esa funded positions at it's that there are fewer general fund positions to help bear the administrative costs so I know you probably all have a lot of questions about those again hopefully Michael will answer them um in the next hour but I'm going to pause before I turn it over to Michael to see if you have uh see if anyone has any questions on what I've presented so far okay not seeing any raised hands or questions in the chat um Michael why don't I turn it over to you thanks Janine uh good afternoon everyone uh hope your Summer's going well thanks for joining us taking some time to learn about our budget I'm excited to share information about the great things the team at Odo is working on and will be doing uh for the next while I'll be walking you through the work of the department and give a full accounting of the resources we are requesting for the bium uh today we will go over the components of developing the agency request budget or ARB and then we'll talk about the overall uh 2527 ARB followed by a deeper dive into the work and budgets for each of odo's Divisions and we'll follow that with information on the estimated impact to the energy supplier assessment I will try not to slip too far into budget jargon during the presentation uh but if you feel uh if anything comes up feel free to uh just ask for clarification and before I dive into all of that I just wanted to familiarize everyone with some terms you will see throughout the presentation uh one is personal services uh and that includes things like salary retirement costs and Health Care related to employee uh compensation costs and as Janine mentioned uh that is one of the significant cost cost drivers of this budget Services supplies and that includes cost for equipment facilities supplies and contracted services within the agency uh special payments are expenditures for which the department isn't primarily isn't the primary beneficiary uh so things like incentive payments that go to uh other agencies or Grant payments and dirt ser and Debt Service which is where we spend on principal interest and premiums related to the debt from our uh small scale energy Loan program so with those uh slides I'll just uh go into the next one here uh with those terms uh and this is what a timeline of the steps the agency uh completes to develop the agency request budget uh that will be submitted to the governor and Das on August 1st we start with the legislative the approved budget for the current bium uh and that's the starting point for creating an agency budget we draw for the cost of living and Merit step increases to create a base budget and these costs are determined by the Oregon Department of administrative services for all agencies we need to make several adjustments to the base budget to determine the current service level which is the amount needed to administer legislatively approved programs in the bium the CSL was submitted to the state cfo's office on the May 31st and presented to the energy advisor workg group in June uh after audit and again most of these figures are calculated and determined by Das and current legislation uh which you see in there like the uh vacancy savings and differentials and What needs to phase in and phase out uh and I want to particularly call out the phase in and phase out step where we need to remove programs and resources that were only funded uh in the current BM using onetime funding uh and even in some cases of that program is expected to continue into the next bium and you can see that will that phase out will happen with most of our incentive programs we then add policy option packages to the current service level budget to arrive at the agency request budget that is submitted to the State cfo's Office later this week as we dive into the accounting of our ARB I want to remind everyone that this process is iterative the governor's recommended budget will be released this December and may look different than what our agency request budget shows you today ultimately we won't know the agency's actual budget until it is approved by the legislature which could happen as late as June 2025 uh but we'll be do our best to keep informed we move throughout the process there it goes okay looks like it went uh so as I mentioned before personal services uh talking about significant changes to our base budget uh and driven by personal services uh that are related to the compensation uh and there were a few significant adjustments between the 2325 and um base budget and this includes the cost of living and Merit step increases which were negotiated uh by the governor and which generally take place every bium and are then built into uh the following bium based budget we also have to phase out limit limited duration positions uh that are statutorily scheduled to end moving on to the current service level budget which represents what it would take to continue our programs that are currently approved by the uh for the next bium uh here we phase Out programs that aren't approved for the next bium and make any adjustments for short session impacts adjust for inflation and account for any fund shifts you can see on this slide uh that we did have to phase out some of our incentive programs and some of the one-time um costs associated with the Oregon climate action commission and building performance standards uh that are phased out of this budget uh at startup cost but the programs themselves will continue into the next bium inflation figures you see here are provided to Odo and all executive branch agencies by the department of administrative services for reference also on this one the different pack uh the different components of the budget you see here are referred to as packages in the system so that's a little bit of our budget jargon that I tried to stay away from but uh that's why you see them referred to here as packages in this okay so I guess I'll pause there see if there's any questions so far all right so now we'll go through a series of slides breaking down the agency request budget the agency request budget is uh created when we add our policy option packages to the CSL and so these slides may look similar to slides presented at last month's ewg for those of you that were there but they are slightly different and reflect the different phases of the budget process these graphs show uh odo's ARB 2527 uh by program by division uh within the department by each division within the apartment and to the left is oo's to total budget which is which is predominantly the energy development services division which includes the inactive smallscale energy Loan program uh or self and the remaining uh Community renewable development grant uh when uh so self is an inactive program and is fairly transactional borrowers make payments uh on their loans and we use that Revenue to pay off our Debt Service uh on the self Bonds on the right side of the oper on the right side is the operating budget for the Department this doesn't include Debt Service payments in the cell program or special payments or incentive money that we distribute and we feel it's a better representation of uh what costs to run the agency on a day-to-day basis it includes our the operating budget includes personal services such as salaries for staff the services and supplies uh to cost to administer o odos programs and day-to-day operation Michael yes we have a question in the chat and I thought I'd interrupt to ask it um could you could you go over package 22 again yes uh so is this slide showing up package 22 back here uh so the phasing out of programs um package 22 is our phase out package and it includes the uh any Services supplies um Capital lay or special payments that we have to phase out in the current bium we have several incentive programs including the solar storage rebate program the Wildfire relief program and Community uh Grant and heat pump programs uh that were included in the budget that we have to phase some of the uh summer all of the money out for um that they were provided and cooling need study uh which we were provided to uh we were providing funding to complete a a study that stud's completed so we have to remove that funding from our budget uh and this is uh I guess a good time to talk about like going back to our our starting point is what was approved in the last legislative uh session through all of our budgets so things that were approved are included in our budget if there were studies or onetime things that the legislature doesn't anticipate going off the package 22 is one of the uh mechanic uh mechanisms for uh making sure that those costs come out of of the budget we also had partial one-time uh startup costs that the legislature provided for um programs around the building performance standards um for building a database and the Oregon climate action commission um and uh the energy technology fund to fund some studies that were going to be done in the county resilience plan um planning to run that program and again I think that if in this uh scenario the the things that you see phased out are because the um you know our current resources have to our our general uh ARB policy option package are supposed to be limited to the 1% that Janine mentioned in her um opening here go ahead Janine sorry oh no you actually said what I was going to say so thanks for covering that yeah this is these were one-time funded programs it's not that they're eliminated from the budget it's just that's how long the legislature funded them for and so because they would represent more than a 1% increase to our current service level budget they're not being",

you know to get the Planning Commission to that case um so any condition the applicant agrees to can be apply what saying was trying to make the point but um our hands are tied a little bit on um conditions the criteria the main criteria is it equally or better suited um you know it's a it's a zone right now that only has uses that they are Le from so it's kind of a tricky one maybe not the same situation I will say just I was on the record we provid numerous notices to the property our proposal to change it multi and they never responded to us so we would have taken it off the map if said restriction many properties off the map that we propos for various zone changes when you know Property Owners contact us and said no no for this reason or that reason so um the we reson other properties in near that University owns in neor family so we were trying to just to be consistent maybe I know Britney here represen an applicant so maybe she not about what the plans are for the well let's move then to Britney and Peter all done we have any other final questions for Peter we have one more shot at him all right thank you Bry would you like to come up and give us your name and your address can I ask a clarifying question of City staff while she's prepares um as part of my preparation for this case I looked at the city permit website the information is publicly available that is part of the record for this correct absolutely okay thank you okay I don't feel like I have to rush so much through this one um so my name is Britney Randall I'm located at 1720 Liberty Street Southeast at bra L use um we're here to talk about 650 15th Street uh commissioner Slater I appreciate your unique the word unique I've been saying weird and that one's better so go with unique um okay so team introduction that's going to be funny because there's two people on there and I'm one of them we'll talk about the background and the request I think that clarify kind of how we got into this unique situation because Lisa is absolutely right I worked for this City at the time that we were doing Outreach for our Salem and it was robust and cumbersome and absolutely they receive notice so yes um we're going to look at a vicinity that we'll look closely at the DEQ restriction I want to talk a little bit about the consequences of the current zoning uh for the uh property owner and then I will summarize and then answer hopefully well any questions that have so our project team um it's Robert is theur property owner and then myself R BR new so here is where we'll kind of talk about what has led to this point um and I'll read to you what's going on these tiny little bubbles because I always forget can't see them as well I can't on my computer so um in 2015 there was an environmental investigation uh out of that investigation from DEQ no further action notice was issued because essentially I keep saying the soils are like radioactive or something something's wrong okay so it's bad um so from that no further action DEQ decided to have this deep restriction imposed on this property that says and I'll show you the language but specifically cannot be used for any type of residential uses and you cannot grow any edible foods on the site so I'm going to stay away I didn't even notice the side I made my client do so it's scary right no further action P restriction like that so uh for some reason there was a gap in time and in 2018 that dqd restriction was finally um recorded then we have uh we go to 2022 and the property was zoned IG and it was listed for sale so my client is the new current property owner but the previous owner list it for sale in 2022 previously to the r sale and taking effect in August of 2022 so my client Robert Bol had the property under contract to buy as an industrial property as the r Salem effective and he closes on the purchase in November of 2022 and realizes some point oh my gosh this now residential or multif family I thought I just bought an industrial property so that was a little bit of a shock to the system um and then we were contacted brand was contacted by U the representative uh for Robert H the current property owner after he discovered that this is no longer an industrial property and so we started to sort of dig into the site and see what what happened what you know I imagined immediately I knew was our Salem but I didn't know immediately there was this deep restriction that exists on the company so um in 2023 so the end of last year we went to before the uh city council and asked this to be City initiated and city council said basically said no it's not going to be City initiated but we'll reduce the application fee by 50% understanding that maybe this is a collaborative oopsy um on everybody's part so the application was submitted to the City of Salem and then in January of this year it was deemed comp for processing and then here we are hoping that um you all will approve this change back to ig which is again kind of weird um and then see we the the change back to Industrial is going to bring the site back into compliance obviously with the deqd Restriction which is the focus of the whole that's that's the goal is to be out of compliance with the Restriction so the vicinity map Peter already showed you kind of where it is but I wanted to show you again that yes the site around our zon multi family residential currently the area looks very industrial but you would imagine this for any site that that the city is is reimagining right it's like there's a process that first step is allowing the uses that you want to see in an area the next step is people actually developing we see it up and down the corridors at mixed use 3 zone right now that a lot of things don't meet the standard of the Zone but unfortunately like we said in this case we have a deep restriction so this can't be utilized the way that the city had originally envisioned so this is a little synopsis of the deqd Restriction the full deed is in our initial materials so in your packet hopefully and you can see here residential use of any type and agricultural food cannot be this these activities cannot take place on this uh property the biggest reason that we're asking you to please please please please say yes is because if you see here um there's some print in the Restriction that talks about what what happens when you master DEQ and it's not good so I don't think that legally we're in violation because these activities aren't happening but our client can't utilize site for anything at this point because it's currently designated for multif family so anything that he does that that matches the applied zoning would be a direct violation of this de restriction and possibly could incur him $225,000 fine every day so um in summary we are saying that this application must be approved um since the designation is in direct violation of the de d restri that we recognize nobody knew applied or was there um and then we are at risk of possibly incurring fines by DQ until it's changed back to Industrial alignment with the Restriction any questions um are there any federal or state that would clean this place up I mean that's that's a real tragedy yeah so I'm not an environmental expert so I wouldn't be able to answer that question but I would imagine there's Scott programs like that available yeah so okay so you know I I'm not familiar with how oil pollutions does affect any of the air or is it just the soil I don't know that either because it's not my area of expertise but the Restriction was due to the soil B all right that's all I have thank you Britney thank you so much um this is a very unique case so I have a couple um my understanding of the way you describe the the DQ restriction is about residential use not res residential designation so is there something that keeps the current property owner for using the property as an industrial site as it's currently Built Well any expansion or changes that he wants to make to his industrial buildings I don't think that we have in the rm2 zoning I don't think we have continued use allowances for industrial zones that's so it has not been occupied or used for industrial purpose within last year for continuing use yeah I believe it's been vacant since you're client purchased it in 2022 correct I don't know how many M we can on once but yes that's and uh what was the buyer owners the owners uh intended use for the property industrial specifically what is he what activities will take place on the site let me Ponder my question okay all right while ping occurs commissioner how I'd like an answer to that what what the specific uses might be I don't have an answer for that so I all I know is that he was seeking industrial property sure he thought he was buying industrial property um they should have called me first I'm going to put that on the I would have told them about our so um sorry can I jump back in I guess you can thank you um I've read through the the DEQ um uh D restrictions in section 5.1 contemplates releaser restrictions um that they're not permanent if you get the DEQ to release the restrictions and and also the restrictions seem to have been based on the future use of it as industrial so can you talk about your clients attempts to communicate with the DEQ about removing their restrictions on the property sure so when I became involved in this project my client had an attorney the insur about where to go from here he'd essentially just bought a property that he can do nothing with um my understanding is that at the advice of an attorney he's not engaged to EQ as to not tip them off that there's a violation now but um similarly to the previous conversation is that we um potentially have programs that could remedy the soil situation um he purchased the property with the intention of using it as industrial so I don't believe that he's doing any homework to try and keep it residential commissioner Tru to the arriv a um during the purchase process was the restriction",

        "text": " I'll go first because I can't help myself um we have had a pretty robust conversation about how to better align um the the presentation of what why jpa is there um with the feedback we've heard not just from you guys but from the the federal delegation around um can't just be a list of projects and so there is a proposal that is being kicked around is to kind of create um a set of stories that highlight policy work that we would like to see done and emphasis where we'd like to see money go um and how investments in transportation have uh further impact to community so um that set of they're calling them stories and I struggle with that a little bit because we're not doing you know like we're storytellers regardless of how we approach it but really looking at um four main themes for these stories and one is the revitalization of local communities expanding access to housing and promoting Economic Development by um looking at Urban arterials and Transit and Equity oriented investment so that's a that's a huge mouthful um but kind of using that to then lift up some projects that we've been able to accomplish without saying this is the project we're asking for funding for but talking about how we're doing jurisdictional transfer or from the highway redesign um the transit oriented development that we've done I think that's really highlights a lot of work that's been done in Washington County the next one is um investment in transit to improve access to Reliable affordable transportation and reduce Transportation related greenhouse gas emissions um obviously we've got a few projects there we could talk about that would be ex examples have were doing that but wouldn't be the focus of the conversation um then creating a safer transportation system without ser ious crashing injuries or fatalities um how we are investing in that and how we'd like to see the federal government invest further um and then um modernization of Transportation infrastructure for climate resilience which is um another key component of how we are looking at things like you know those bridges that you were all discussing earlier uh so those kinds of we have some major bridges that have some resiliency issues we're trying to find ways to pay for them um so all but also you know just the extreme weather events that we have um flooding that can occur ice storms that occur it's it's really fun around here um so really taking instead of being like here's 17 projects we would like to see funded say we know you've done a bunch of investment these are the areas where we're seeing the most need and the most work that we've been able to get done um it's probably too soon to ask you to do this but we'd like you to start thinking about the next transportation in infastructure financing package because it's never too early to do 15 weeks of infrastructure week uh before anybody does any work at the federal level uh so kind of kicking it off in that direction is kind of where I've been pushing us some people tell me that perhaps I should stop um living in this idealized world where the federal government works efficiently across uh to develop things in a timely manner and in a cycle that we can all appreciate and invest in uh but I won't I won't the little bit of optimism I have I'm not losing it um so all of that is to say it's really a reframing of how we present the work that we're doing in this region to really focus on how we are meeting the goals of the federal legislative process um and then so that's day one with the uh with the legislature um I think we haven't really dug into what we're trying to accomplish with us do but it's similar in nature using these you know four themes to tell the story and connect uh get connection to our projects and thinking about us as not just one bridge that needs replacing but a community that works together um and presents a unified front for the major Investments that we need um and how we can convince us do to give us all the money that they have um without asking them to give us all the money that they have uh so that's kind of day two and then day three um as uh Stephen noted as soon as I know who all is planning to attend I've already asked asked our um Federal team to start setting up some meetings and we can figure out what the purpose and intent of those meetings are it can be more of the same discussion around Transportation or we could have a different type of conversation about what the needs are in the region or or not the region within Washington County the geography not just Washington County The Entity um and and have a robust conversation that is additive to the whole jpac trip um but haven't set that specific agenda yet want to work with you all in creating that as so everyone feels comfortable and has a feels the purpose of being out there and having those conversations in a separate set of meetings on Thursday um Jessica what did miss that was a great overview um I was wondering if we should share the four themes or if we I don't know I guess you kind of went over them but to see if um any of you have any input on this approach basically versus a list of projects because we heard really clearly from or Stephen and Aaron heard very clearly last year that a list of projects didn't work well it was too much and so we think this whole approach with the Thematic working together we're trying to get things done and um help us get things more things done basically would work a lot better so like Erin said we really need to know who was who is going to finalize their travel plan and join us um I think the last we heard only a handful of you were planning to go so maybe mayor Buck or chair Buick we can go around the room and everyone can say whether they're attending or not and who's planning to attend that might help us right uh I plan on attending as does McCarthy uh others I know Callaway told me he's going I don't know who's going with him but I know he's going i s mayor feld's hand up thank you I'm attending as is our transportation director Dwight rasher and Mark atad and a head of our government others see head shaken this GNA be mayor for show myself and cway wo looks like the one we clear on was mayor Rosner but as he's not here I guess we we can follow up with him later I sent him a text but he didn't respond okay yeah and I think for the county um I know commissioner F and I will be sitting in budget meetings that week um so Aaron and Jessica are both planning to go from the county okay Rick do you know if anyone besides C's going or because usually you guys have a handful of people might be off away from the computer I don't I don't I don't know if um anyone else from the city's going I haven't been I'm privy to that yeah right understanding I think um I think Matt deada from the city was planning to join mayor Calla mayor from uh King City went last year is anybody gonna check in with King city folks Mike Mike was saying he didn't think so they just named a new mayor um so I don't know if she's gonna attend or not like this what does that mean no they have two people they can't even meet one-on-one without a quum um y I don't yeah poor King City I mean I just don't even if oh that's the bell I gotta go by everyone but we can continue to reach out find out who's going to go so we can have a final list for Jessica and then the story I think as mentioned you know we heard loud and clear from representative blumin hour last year don't give me that list give me why it's important and why it's better than the other project I think the storytelling uh effective strategy versus just saying give us $100 million trust us these are good you know push it over the Finish Line why this needs to be done here in Washington County or in the metro area versus the money going to Dayton Ohio I agree I remember that was a very clearly delivered y okay Stephen I think this is his last year so but I think he spoke for others yeah yeah I was I was GNA I think we probably heard a similar message from I think it was Senator Merkley uh as well kind of a a similar similar take on things so we do think that this is an opportunity both to within the the construct of a narrative and thematic approach also to talk about specific examples of projects that either the federal government has helped with and we want to thank them for Andor are opportunities where ongoing funding for some new programs will really help us to continue achieving good things um and so that in a sense is a way to talk about some project priorities but really framed within that much larger Narrative of the importance of some of these programs and continuing to uh well continuing the programs maybe with some alterations of refinements I think the the sense is that the climate in DC is not great right now this year certainly for um a significant amount of Headway on that but it's never as Aaron said it's never too early to start talking they were all celebrating that they got the 24 budget finally approved and the community involvement projects done and they're supposed to be starting on the 25 stuff now and they're still working on 24 yeah they're not quite done with the 24 budget they still three quarters of the budget it's fine everything's fine yeah you know they're in a severe time lag there all right anything else on this one well I was just going to close it out by saying that eron and I can follow up with everyone planning to attend so that we can go over these thematic messages in more detail much appreciated all right that brings us to item D the jpack agenda uh mayor cway is uh ill so that commissioner F can you speak to the jpack agenda or Rick want to cover it or I guess commissioner you go first uh Rick did you wanted to do it I don't have much information on the agenda yes I could quickly it's a very light agenda chair and everyone um there is one consent agenda item which is adding a new OD carpon funded signal project grouping and this is adding to the 2024 2027 m m tip and it's about about um project delivery requirements um so this is an OD do project and that that there's not a lot of information uh uh included on the agenda so look cour to that",

        "text": " you can see that we've received a total of 32 million dollars since Inception in 97 from all the facilities this includes our selection and Contracting fees as well so not all the 32 million goes directly towards purchasing offsets the selection and Contracting fees that is used for contract negotiations um it's becoming a really competitive market so it allows us to go out meet with different groups and go through our risk committee which is our evaluation process and it also supports Us in managing the projects to make sure that the offsets are actually issued and delivered to the climate trust for uh next slide please so this is just the status of the facilities many of the facilities we have obligated all of the cash to projects and retired credits on behalf of them uh just to know all I'm sorry I'm in I'm traveling for work right now and so I'm in the hotel and someone's just knocking the door um so just know all of these facilities we have spent the 60 made the 60 commit commitment and we submitted audited reports at that time um in 2020 we did have a large D obligation from uh one project that transitioned to low carbon fuel standard when the project transitioned to low carbon fuels fuel standard we realized we would not receive any more offsets for that from that project so many of the facilities have more unobligated cash in 2021 than they did in 2020 uh our plan is to so we have 7.2 million at the end of 2021 left our plan is to spend down all of the funds by the end of 2025 with the last credits being issued in 2026. so at this time our planet is to spend 1.4 million per year on offsets um and the way that we're doing the structure of purchasing the credits now as as opposed to years prior is the Futures Market has become more competitive so we are choosing to purchase offsets more in the spot Market as opposed to entering long-term agreements this also helps us hedge risk because in the long-term agreements sometimes projects might change and then you end up not getting offsets from them so then the cash becomes unobligated cash once again and next slide please so as part of the Oregon program we try to purchase credits in from the state of Oregon so that we are using organ dollars within the state uh Oregon does not have that many carbon offset projects at this time uh we have funded with Oregon dollars 22 projects in the state of Oregon out of 33 total that Oregon dollars have been used towards that's been 7.7 million commitment to Oregon projects of every dollar that we've received from the program 45 cents has been State spent within the state of Oregon so far and we've retired 1 million credits from offsets in Oregon uh next slide please so in 2021 we almost spent a million dollars on of Oregon funds on carbon offset purchases we've retired a little over a hundred thousand offsets on behalf of the program to date uh 71 of funds have been committed and uh like I mentioned just on the last slide we hope to submit the final report in 2026 and retire the last credits in 2026. I also realized um now that we have received two true up payments uh from two facilities this year so if that continues this will be extended past um next slide please so the state of the voluntary carbon Market uh the climate trust we purchase credits from the American carbon registry Vera and climate action Reserve Registries they are the governing body of offsets so they develop peer-reviewed protocols that quantify the mission reductions from carbon offset projects they also work with verification teams to verify that what we say is happening from the projects is actually happening we choose to work with these three Registries because of their high integrity so they require that um in in all carbon officer projects do do this that the offset is permanent so and if there is an insurance pool in case the offset is reversed that the offset is additional which means it's above business as usual had the carbon funding not come in this carbon reduction would not have occurred and that the project prevents leakage so a reduction in a greenhouse gas emission from one project area won't end up with an increase in emission reductions from another project area in 2021 the voluntary carbon Market hit one billion dollars in annual transaction in US Dollars that is a global number so the market is rapidly expanding as more corporates are making commitments for climate action plans and carbon neutrality uh with the Oregon CO2 standard dollars since Inception the average price of offsets was is was 538 but in 2020 and 2021 even in the face of covid carbon offset prices have continued to go up and the average price of purchase in those two years was 867. um the average price of new contracts that the climate trust has entered into in 2021 was 1129 and that has continued to go up in 2022. we have seen in the past few months prices go slightly down by about a dollar or two uh because of the recession and Global economics but at conferences and economic forecasts still see that the the dollar value of carbon offsets continue to increase even in the face of impending recessions and economic turmoil and next slide please just a quick overview of our governance uh so the climate trust we have a finance committee a compensation committee and a risk committee uh the board chair supervises our executive director and we work with all of these groups or all of these committees to approve our offset contracts uh the risk committee is where the Oregon offset committee comes in the Oregon offset committee reviews all contracts and our evaluations of projects that we might be using Oregon funds for the purchase of offsets next slide please this is just the organization I think last year when I presented out in June of 2021 we were a staff of four so we have continued to grow we've added um four members in the past year and we plan on adding three more in the next few months especially now that we've received this USDA Commodities Grant next slide please this is just an overview of the board of directors we um are currently reviewing to add another Northwest Energy council member and I think we're also in the process of adding a direct board member as well next slide please and that's it so if um I'm here for any questions that you might have or if you want to go back and look at the uh the status of the facilities I'm happy to do that as well thank you very much uh the office members have any questions yes Cindy I'm Cindy Conan thank you for that um presentation I just have a question on the performance by a and just if you go to that and we go that side so for the oven grid climatical generation just trying to understand how this networks work um so it looks like that the office the project number two is relatively old uh from the previous slide but it's less than half of the funds obligated and I'm just wondering about that 60 percent yeah so we hit the 60 requirement of cash obligated and we were in a a forward sale so payment on delivery but we entered into an agreement to purchase credits from a project for about 10 years that project ended up switching to low carbon fuel standards so cash that was obligated to go towards offsets then became unobligated uh and so when we're allocating funds from the Oregon program we kind of treat it all of the facilities as one big program but we always make sure that if something does fall below the 60 threshold that we spend money from that facility specifically first so this year in 2022 we've spent two million dollars so far most of that uh was in the winter time so when you see this next year the Klamath co-generation project will go back to that 60 threshold um so the cash obligated does not necessarily mean that that cash has gone out yet it can be just obligated in a forward contract but at this time no Oregon facilities um our obligated offsets from our forward contracts so all the cash obligated on this screen has actually gone out um does that help fear that up yes thank you I appreciate that thank you any other questions well we thank you for coming to present it to us and the work that you are doing um we will look forward to seeing you next year great all right good luck with the rest of the meeting thank you for the time thank you thank you that concludes the agenda item D for moving on the agenda item e we have a recycling of wind turbine components this is an information item we have Daniel Perry when asset manager for Brookville renewable who will provide an overview for us patiently patiently waiting yes thank appreciate it good morning everyone if we go to our first slide um so for the few folks who are newer to the council Cindy how you doing um so a brief overview of Shepard's flies so I I first got out to Shepherd's flat in 2013 so I've had various roles at the facility over that time so mainly with generally electric who's the turbine manufacturer and Shepard's spot is comprised of three individual sites but it's tied into bonneville's Grid at one point um so in short speed we summarize as one facility even though it's three individual sites so for example Shepherds plot North went into operation in 2011 so it's 106 turbines which produce 265 megawatts so all of our turbines on site are 2.5 megawatt Shepherd Central went into operation in 2012 116 turbines 290 megawatts Shepherd South went into operation in 2012 as well 116 turbines 290 megawatts so the entire site makes up about 80 makes up 845 megawatts so when the wind is churning through the gorge or a significant portion of the Grid in the Northwest right so larger than the retired coal plants that's that used to be nearest and Boardman a pretty large significant facility the the site sits at um sits on about 37 000 Acres so also very key in the community making sure we're taking care of uh taking care of our counties taking care of our landowners so uh part of our part of this process has been with the um with the council so the installed blades were measured for 48.7 meters and in 2019 we came uh I'm sorry the previous organization so what I also should",

        "text": " study needed to understand pathways for 100 clean but if you have something to clarify there go ahead otherwise we can also talk about this during the discussion yeah david um so certainly um in the in the near term we're not seeing any movement from utilities um where they're pla they're including in their planning documents any intentions build out big facilities to meet you know utility scale renewable hydrogen production for generation um that said we expect project developers to um to be building their own projects in the nearer term though electricity generation isn't necessarily best use case um certainly it can play a role there like i said especially for grid balancing and in the longer term uh we may see we may see it replace you know natural gas combustion who knows but in the near term and i'll touch on this later with expected end uses of renewable hydrogen in oregon is that um given the cost of renewable electricity um you know it's it could interfere with that cost cap in the the rps and 100 clean uh standard to development right now when it is higher and then also there are other sectors where electrification really isn't an opera an um or certainly not the best option and you know there's a lot of momentum to trying to use renewable hydrogen to decarbonize those sectors first where we're not exactly spoiled for choice for thanks rebecca and thanks david um not seeing any other questions in the chat so back to you all right next slide please oh look there's that pause okay so as i mentioned i'm gonna try to go through some of these policies um a little more quickly i really wanted to go in depth um with the rps and 100 clean to give you um kind of an opportunity to see how we're approaching the analysis um so next up is the climate protection and this is a greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy and so it includes a declining cap on greenhouse gases from fossil fuels and so this is going to include diesel and propane and natural gas used in the transportation and residential and the commercial and the industrial sectors the cpp also includes site-specific greenhouse gas targets for manufacturing facilities um and deq lists um about 25 facilities uh that would be covered and of these 25 at least four appear to be semiconductor one is a cement producer a steel mill and then others so to comply with the cpp we expect that natural gas utilities are going to turn to either renewable natural gas or renewable hydrogen or some mixture of both to replace fossil natural gas and that's really um you know going to depend on kind of what's available in the market how much it costs and then what their long-term plan is um you know system transformation uh for example northwest natural here in oregon has uh shown a lot of interest in both rng and renewable hydrogen um and so we certainly expect to see both of those used as compliance pathways for them um we're still doing outreach on some of the stationary sources with site specific targets to see if they might be candidates for use of renewable hydrogen for compliance so uh you know its role here um is a maybe for those um those point source um sites and sorry and then finally the cpp includes the transportation sector and so i'm going to defer to the next few slides on transportation programs specifically to talk about how uh renewable hydrogen might help transportation policies next slide the clean fuels program is another policy that renewable hydrogen will likely support um the program requires reductions in the average greenhouse gas emissions per unit of fuel energy um most recently updated uh to 25 below 2015 levels by 2035. um hydrogen is the most recent fuel to be used in the program first used in 2021 um and used for forklifts um but thus far the volumes have been pretty modest and then oregon also has zero emissions vehicle adoption goals for vehicles sold in the state um so zero emissions vehicle also referred to as zev these though are primarily focused on light duty passenger vehicles and so where hydrogen is expected to have a more modest role to play um but for medium and heavy duty deq has recently adopted california's advanced clean trucks rule which will require manufacturers of medium and heavy-duty vehicles to sell a certain percent of zevs in the state um and so that could include hydrogen fuel cell vehicles next slide please uh in a clean fuels program review uh deq estimated that there would only be 0.19 million diesel gallon equivalents of hydrogen in the program by 2025 and you'll see i've circled it in red here i should mention that it's unclear whether that would be quote unquote renewable hydrogen the clean fuels program is really focused on the carbon intensity differential between an alternative fuel and what the more traditional fuel was so you could potentially have um conventional hydrogen produced close to a use source and have a lower ci than renewable hydrogen that is then transparent transported from say california and includes all of those life cycle emissions associated with driving it up on a truck anyway this is all to say that the eq's analysis doesn't estimate a lot of future consumption for hydrogen in oregon at least out to 2025 and certainly you can see that's a the second smallest number there and much smaller compared to for example renewable diesel also uh deq asked icf to do some scenario analysis for them as they update the clean fuels program and in one of in only one of those scenarios did icf look at and uh it assumes in that in that analysis that sales rate sales rates in oregon for hydrogen class seven eight trucks to be five percent in 2033 and 10 in 2035 uh next slide please and then these uh beautiful graphics are all from odot's recently published hydrogen pathways and that looks at the potential hydrogen fueling infrastructure needs based on assumptions on uptake of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles for both light medium and heavy duty use cases so at the top left are their assumptions for uptake of fuel cell evs in oregon by 2035 um and so you can see you know they're assuming that five percent of all of the urban light duty zabs are going to be fuel cell um of um of zev buses are going to be fuel cells and then up to 10 of medium duty and up to 25 of heavy duty so their their expectation is that we're going to see the highest uptake of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the heavy duty sector um and then if you look at the bottom left um there's a graph here that shows light duty fuel cell ev uptake but then also hydrogen fuels the fueling stations and you can see that it really starts to take off from 2030 to about 2035 so when we talk about a nearer term of fuel cell vehicles across across use cases uh we're really looking at post 20 30 to see much movement um and then the last chart on the right that shows odot's modeling assumptions for the need for fueling stations and so by 2035 uh they estimate a need for 47 hydrogen fueling stations to support five percent hydrogen fuel cell ev penetration for light duty and 19 stations for medium and heavy duty vehicles and of course i should mention that there's no stated assumption in all of these that these stations would be dispensing renewable hydrogen this is just more a look of hydrogen in general as a transportation fuel and what it's really showing us is that the expectation is that the pickup is going to be higher in medium and heavy duty sectors and um looking to not really take off until about 20 30. next slide so wrapping these up into our initial study findings we certainly one of the difficulties here is that there isn't a dependable supply right now of renewable hydrogen in the northwest as i mentioned for being counted in the clean fuels program using hydrogen all of their hydrogen is trucked from california and that adds to the cost that adds to the carbon intensity and that adds volatility to the supply in general and then there's also no hydrogen fuelling infrastructure in oregon of any kind right now we have zero hydrogen fueling stations right now and so at least in the near term um we really don't see renewable hydrogen playing um a huge role in meeting some of these policies and goals certainly there is a role to be played um but we see this as certainly in in the longer term um that said there are um a number of analyses out there that suggest that some of the use cases where renewable hydrogen might become cost competitive soonest is with some heavy-duty transportation applications so it's possible that these forecasts might be er overly conservative and we can see more adoption um sooner and if so it would likely be in the heavy duty context and then certainly as i mentioned um you know some of the analysis from odot in terms of what kind of infrastructure we need and how many vehicles we expect all of that is talking about hydrogen generally and so a secondary analysis would be necessary to make an estimate of how much of adopted fuel cell vehicles in the state we would expect to be running on renewable hydrogen as opposed to just and uh let's pause for clarifying thanks rebecca um there was a clarifying question that tip was taking care of in the chat from kathy about clean fuels program but not seeing any other um questions yet there was a comment from ken about renewable diesel using hydrogen as a feedstock and represent a market renewable hydrogen in the snake that is a great point ken thank you for mentioning that i'm not seeing any other questions though i can pause for a moment to see if any typing happening but there's no hands raised okay okay go ahead rebecca uh next slide so the next study requirement is the inventory of the total hydrogen volume currently used in oregon annually next so these blocks here include the usual suspects of hydrogen consumption that in oregon we've identified uh 24 semiconductor firms that may have some manufacturing capabilities in the state and we are in continuing conversations with a number of them with our data with respect to forklifts we know through the clean fuels program that there are two facilities using hydrogen for forklifts and we know their consumption volumes there are two steel companies in oregon but one looks like it's no longer an operation and it's not clear that either of them are uh using processes that require hydrogen there is one fertilizer plant in the um and then there are other possible consumers of hydrogen that we're still identifying so i'm really glad that ken mentioned renewable diesel production um you know the",

for pouncing on this opportunity and I am having my fingers crossed that we are successful in our grant thank you thank you councilor and they really did uh do amazingly quick work to get this application prepared and ready for us tonight it's a very very short timeline so they did they did some really great counselor Hoy just to clear it up back to Air Service I had heard a number of passengers with regard to to flights is that a thing does anybody know what that is the the like the size of the aircraft yeah yes we do know can we I think we can say that can we say that uh Dan Atchison City Attorney John Pascal might build into that better I believe there's some concern about releasing the aircraft type because I would probably identify the name of the airline we'll probably tell you the number of passengers it's more than a hundred okay I can tell you that thank you for that yeah and I have I just also for council's knowledge I have spoken personally with the CEO of the undisclosed Airline and I'm very comfortable uh with the situation so any other discussion if the recorder will please call the for hoy Mr Nordic councilor Varney aye counselor Stapleton aye councilor nishioka aye councilor Phillips aye councilor Gwen aye mayor Hoy aye motion passes on the public hearings item 4A public hearing concerning the 2023 annual action plan for Community Development block grant and home investment partnership program funds the hearing will begin with the staff presentation and if there's any individuals here to testify they're limited to three minutes please state your name and address or award number for the record thank you thank you and I see that we have Tiffany Otis here with us this evening to walk us through the uh the hearing good evening city council and mayor my name is Tiffany Otis and I'm with Federal programs manager for Urban Development Department the purpose of tonight's public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public to hear and comment on the proposed 2023 Community Development block grant and home investment partnership annual action plan the annual plan addresses the funding goals and priorities identified in the 2020-2024 Consolidated plan which includes the Salem strategic plan goals of addressing affordable housing homelessness and Social Services the annual action plan is an implementation of goals identified in the 2020-2024 Consolidated plan annual action plan Outreach consisted of contact with various Social Service organizations attendance at Multicultural array of community published notices website announcements and a notice on the city's Facebook page the annual plan is formed with consideration to other Community Driven initiatives and addressing affordable housing Economic Development and supportive services for low-income and at-risk populations for example a priority and the council approved strategic plan includes a community desire to increase affordable housing options improve coordination of Social Services and reduce the number of hardest to house chronically homeless in the community or like the city of Salem's multi-family housing design process which included public input to help meet Salem's housing needs by removing barriers to multi-family Housing Development and ensure new development is compatible with neighborhoods the Continuum of Care guides the use of the mckinney-vento federal funding for emergency and transitional housing with Supportive currently the city has a five-year Consolidated plan which outlines the city's priorities and goals this is year four of the Consolidated plan and these are the identified priorities seen on the slide the AAP funding cycle began in early fall with staff conducting informational Outreach to our City's for-profit and non-profit entities in October a notice was published in the Statesman Journal minority Publications and a press release was issued the Public Announcement was posted on the city's website at the Salem public library and distributed at various meetings such as the emergency housing Network Salem Kaiser collaborative and the Continuum of Care in December after the application period closed on November 30th staff reviewed the proposals to determine if the proposed activities were eligible based upon the federal funding guidelines applications were then forwarded to a panelist group comprised of Salem citizens for review and scoring staff then rank the applications based upon the total scores funding recommendations are based on those rankings and the administrative recommendations are outlined in the draft annual plan which was publicly noticed and transmitted to Community the City of Salem is a participating jurisdiction grantee of Hud funds and must address housing needs and priorities consistent to the Consolidated plan outline the award amounts are formula-based Community Development block grant or HUD Awards 70 of formula funds to the entitlement jurisdictions those are cities with populations over 50 000 and counties with populations over two hundred thousand the balance of those funds goes to the state for allocation to less populous towns and counties home investment partnership program or home is a block grant provided by Hud directly to large cities like Salem the home formula is based on a range of factors including the inadequacy of housing Supply the incidence of poverty and fiscal distress HUD uses formulas to determine each entitlement jurisdiction's allocation both of which are weighted to account for the share of the population in these are the 2023 allocation amounts the proposed projects for 2023 will provide various types of assistance to approximately 3 000 individuals and families within Salem these projects are designed to assist low to moderate citizens with economic social and housing needs the city will contract with applicants once the Department of Housing and Urban Development submit Federal funding agreements and they are duly executed by our city manager Federal Regulations also require the city to conduct an environmental review of each activity deter to determine whether a project may have an impact on the environment the federal funding available to award includes annual entitlement program income from loans previously project cost savings and unallocated resource from previous years the total available resources are used to fund programs projects and administrative expenses administrative expenses are capped at 10 percent for the home entitlement program and income and at 20 percent for cdbg entitlement and program income Grant sub-recipients are also required to provide a 25 match to leverage the federal funds cdbg there were 10 applications and four were qualified for funding the cdbg proposed projects recommended for funding fall into the priority areas of addressing homelessness these activities include Case Management Services for Saint Francis shelter and women at the well Grace house Food Services for Seniors via Marion Polk food share and the City of Salem land acquisition and homeless activities that meet the con plan objectives home there were seven applications and three were qualified for funding the home proposed projects recommended for funding into the priority area of expanding affordable housing these activities include Dev Northwest for down payment assistance for the McClay project of approximately 24 single-family residences homes and the dev Northwest operating as the choto for the City of Salem for operating and Applegate Landing LLC for Applegate Terrace Apartments 48 units veterans focused affordable rental complex with 12 units specifically for veterans all units will be affordable to households at or below the 60 Ami the complex will include wrap-around services on site general fund for public service had seven applications four were qualified for funding these four met the metrics for the funding the city's general fund allocation of program Services is used to meet the 25 match HUD for the City of Salem the next steps after City council's vote tonight staff will submit all plans and certifications for the HUD approval complete the environmental reviews and the sub-recipient agreements for the target of July 1 for the implementation of those agreements staff will conduct ongoing evaluations file reviews and program evaluations staff will continue to report to the council and public for any amendments needed and the keeper for reporting end-of-year accomplishments thank you Ms Otis thank you and now we'll we'll go to uh public comment and then we'll come back to you for questions thank you first up we have first of all as a reminder you have three minutes be sure and introduce yourself state your name or your word for the record and be sure that the green light's on before you start talking first up is James Lutz oh it was on now very good thank you um James Lutz Ward one um I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight I want to thank the counselors in the City of Salem and the Salem housing authority for their ongoing efforts to support the housing needs of our veterans our families and our vulnerable populations I'm very excited to receive funding from the City of Salem for my veterans focused affordable housing project with our current and ongoing housing crisis in Oregon we're excited to bring a new development for our veterans and our other low-income families Applegate Applegate Terrace is a veterans focused affordable housing complex that will have on-site resident services these affordable housing funds will help Galvanize the construction of this facility and will be essential to the success of the project Applegate is committed to providing supportive affordable housing to our Central Valley while minimizing environmental impacts strengthening communities and maintaining Community our goal is to have an inclusive population unburdened by high rent with on-site access to Supportive Services this is accomplished in part by working close with local communities and agencies promoting quality housing standards and utilizing Innovative construction Concepts to attain a cost effective complex our emphasis on Veterans and partnering with local care providers allows Applegate to provide residents with on-site holistic care services a little Recreation a life and life-improving Applegate teamed up with an Oregon non-profit organization cost of Oregon to apply for and Chase funding for the cost is a development consultant from Oregon that specializes in the housing needs of our Oregon residents and has been working to help Oregon residents for many years we recently completed Applegate Landing in Lebanon Oregon this was our 48 unit prototype veterans focused affordable housing complex that we completed in not too easy during the covid but we were able to complete the project on time and on budget actually the Applegate project in Lebanon has close to a 50 percent occupancy rate of veterans and their families which I hear is very good always wanted more but 24 out of 48 kind of comes and goes a little bit but that's a pretty good for the little town of Lebanon this prototype project has been a great success for our residents and our small town of Lebanon seeing the ever increasing need to help our veterans and low-income families over the last several decades I decided to use my construction experience to take the first",

        "text": " of rules from a rul making process um that is occurring right now and we'll have an opportunity to uh comment on those uh a number of things again spent a lot of time on this but you see we're all kind of working towards that July uh 2025 implementation date that launch R launch so what are those overall action steps next steps uh other than reviewing the that plan that's been subed one is you know we need to continue and uh increase our talking with our our service providers and our partners so Maran County other other local government um the uh recycling processors uh hollers group and you know work together on what that plan is because I I do believe that we work best and we're working together with our partners we're not asyo I I emphasize that when we first started this this uh committee that Salem does not operate solid waste on itself own we are a piece of a larger puzzle and so what R may want to continue that theme that we are working with our partners to ensure that revitalizing renewing our recycling system properly with our partners with this question yes I did thank you for noticing um so would this include so I'm thinking primarily this is at at the individual or multifam areas and not so much construction um in the sense murf and and that you know would that be included in a facility that would be participating or are we really looking at primarily the user end and their recycling in the sense of uh you know me what I buy at the store and the packaging that I have or is this really covering construction and everything else uh C you'll correct me if I say this wrong I'm sure but my my general understanding is that no this does not cover Construction demolition this is primarily a product user and focus and the Upstream of that back to the producer for those products got a fa statement cat you got it all right great I just wanted Clarity on thank you um so next would be aside from obviously talking with the partners part of that then is determining that internal process of funding authorization are we going to have all the money come through us and direct it or are we going to authorize some of that to go to our partners um and then further based on that um PR need to know who to talk to so that's the the context are survey fairly simple really but it's a it's a key piece of it so they know who those key players are and then also that's part of who we are if if we're not the center of that you know who we are relying on to help uh manage that on behalf of the so as always you can go to recycling and.go lots of great information out there um and I'm going to open it up to questions I guess I'll say that's the end of my presentation Micky would you like to open up to questions and myself and C are available great J okay the questions I I do have a couple a few maybe I would say and my guess is all of these will be directed primarily to cat so hopefully can you hear me okay I can I can thank you thank you um so when this was presented um there's an oregin recycling systems advisory Council I'm curious as to who they are and where they meet is this a colle across the state or is it focused in Portland or no it's it's a group um of people that actually were assigned by the governor's office so it's a very high level um they certainly when they chose the members of that group they tried to get them from all parts of the state of course um we really need voices from everywhere um so that Council will advise us on certain parts of how we're implementing RMA thank you they meet I'm sorry I didn't me interrupt you I I think they quarterly and mostly virtually yes I would think they if it's across the state that would be the best way to make sure everyone is able to attend yeah and the the meetings the um like registration links the notes all of that they're on deq's website and the council has their own um web page thank you I'm going to continue with a couple questions that's all right um the with's a new uh modern modernized recycling system um will there be or do you anticipate that there's going to be new symbols or maybe I should even say corrected symbols because people are still lost in the land of the old symbols that are not applying any longer and again that was why I was saying it'd be really nice if we could have clear instructions on the containers receiving the items to know and so I'm just wondering if there's been any discussion so that the manufacturers can change that so A few things um part of RMA at the early early stages was U we put together a truth and labeling task force so they could look at those labels because you're right they're super confusing and you know if people see the chasing arrows it's definitely going in the cart regardless if it's recyclable or not um that task force did propose something to the legislature um I don't believe there's been any changes in labeling based on that I know California has has made has passed some some labeling um but we I don't think we've done that in Oregon um so the kind of chasing arrows thing I'm not sure we're moving forward with anything on that um but in regards to the uniform Statewide collection list which are the appropriate materials that can be co-mingled the pro will be required to create the educational materials around that um and so that those materials will all look the same so the City of Salem the city of clim withth Falls the city of everyone is going to be looking at the same type of messaging when it comes to what can go in the cart so that will look the same across the state and then a local government or service provider they can put them in their newsletters they can put it on the website they can take that material and then spread out they can put the City of Salem on it or dno Garbage or whatever um so it can look like you know a particular label but the Imaging itself should look similar across the state great yeah we need to make sure the manufacturers stop mislabeling or or misguiding us um then the um the multi-tenant um are we needing to adjust any policies that when we write up policies with um the collectors the haulers if we have to change policies for the multi housing that was on the required cities so there's a couple of things we may need to do one working with planning and where to to ensure that uh as development is occurring that there's sufficient uh space for the enclosure and also space access those enclosures that's basically what I'm asking so it sounds like planning is going to need to potentially make adjustments for this and might make any policy changes Y and just an FYI on multif family recycling it's really important um and there's a lot of material generated at those types of properties and we want to get to it um but we want to be really thoughtful about how we do it um it it has a very very high contamination rate um so there's lots of issues around multif Properties it is very likely that this particular rule is going to change slightly um there is a proposal and because we're still going through the rule process I think you know Ryan alluded to that um one of the recommendations is to move the 2026 date out a little bit further so DEQ can do more work to help the local governments provide you with some code like template codee and things like that to help you move forward with these requirements because they're there's quite a few of them so um I'm pretty sure that the date on this is actually going to move out a little bit so the city and DEQ will have more time to plan and we'll will'll have more of an ability to help the local governments out with this particular requirement I can see a lot of retrofitting that may be a challenge and so new new um developments that's a that's much easier to fix than absolutely and we completely agree thank you that's very good point that ends my questions okay thank you well I had a couple more comments I had some comments and questions and some of that is to build on the multifamily and I agree Ryan that uh this was a concern brought up to me from Valley Recycling where they have challenges right now getting into new developments to pick up materials so I think it's really important that they are they're providing input and uh that our planning department is potentially is going to be involved in this because that's really crucial they have to be able to get in there to pick those things up we completely agree okay and as for moving the implementation date backwards I mean to me it seems almost like a gradual implementation would work better than the the sudden one potentially one of my big concerns with multifam is when it comes to enforcement how is this going to be enforced without raising the rates on folks who are living there right ultim yeah ultimately that could happen um that the cost could get pushed down to the tenants which is not what we want want to have happen um and just to address your phasing in I completely agree and I feel like the approach that we're proposing right now will have the cities submit a plan talking about how they'll get it implemented by a date further out so it will give us all time to think about how we can phase in some of these things like you said some are going to be a lot easier than others so that's that's where what we're proposing at the moment rules aren't written and you know solid yet the eqc has not approved them but that is the direction that we're headed because all of your concerns are completely valid and we when we move forward with this we definitely want to have everyone at the table and currently we are doing a multif family needs assessment so we are talking to Property Owners we are talking to tenants we are surveying the service providers to get input to find out what the barriers are what the problems are what does good multif family recycling look like what does bad multif family recycling look like because we want to take all of those things into consideration before we move forward thank you I can see how family would be very challenging right because a tenant they're not going to have the same care and concern as the property owner who's paying to have the garbage removed right so I unless you can somehow I don't know monitor individually you",

        "text": " work that you see here this past in one of those Mega bills I talked about House Bill 3409 but this was the underlying content came from the conversation of House Bill 3181 and basically just to kind of back up a little on the citing table process there were work groups and negotiations happening I mentioned deadline day which is um the first the bill for the date by which a bill has to move out of its chamber of origin and that date is really very crucial um for getting sort of things lined up and this was coming together like a week before that deadline it was all very late breaking and somehow in that negotiation there ended up being sort of different bills that were out there that were coming from the it was the bill from the table but then there was these those from the developers that included a lot of land use changes there was a concept I don't want to get too much into the Weeds on this but a concept that would have made it much easier to develop on exclusive Farm youth um exclusive Farm use land that was located near no matter no matter the value of it it could have even been high value but if it was close to transmission lines then it could become just sort of automatically eligible for solar sighting so there there's some pretty bold changes that were being negotiated on that in the end kind of went away and what got left was what we just talked about that solar sighting um that solar jurisdictional change and so I bring all of that up as context because what in the end is going to happen is um dlcd as you know has an exceptions process for exclusive Farmland exclusive Forest lands too but mostly farmland for this conversation and so dlcd is directed by uh to create rules to allow local governments in fsec to permit solar facilities and prioritize solar facility sighting that does not conflict with natural resource lands and areas of valuable habitats kind of the top line on this bill the idea is really like can we identify places uh more easily and sort of change dlcd's exceptions to make it easier for Solar Development to happen in these low conflict areas and so dlcd will take the lead on this work it will definitely have an impact in the citing process at fsec and at counties where there are these conversations about the exceptions process and this bill also directs the dlcd to put together a rules advisory committee and I just wanted to flag that you know State agencies are listed just as state agencies in the Bell but I promise that the Oregon's Department of energy will be part of that process in some way shape or form um we're an important voice on the issue and because we have fsec under our jurisdiction so we'll be tracking this work really carefully making sure that F6 interests are considered in the conversation and then also I just want to flag that I know you've all seen the Oregon renewable energy assessment tool the map that um that Wally in particular works really hard on from our sighting division but the orisa tool and that tool will be could be updated as a result of this process as well so just know that this is coming and it was kind of the outcome of that sort of side conversation about land use changes and also part of the citing table conversation that was happening the siding table by the way was staffed by three groups um Verde 1 000 friends of Oregon and renewable Northwest they sort of concluded the work right when that deadline happened but there was conversation about continuing the work in the future so just know that that siting table could be back with us perhaps with the same leadership perhaps with different different leadership and we'll continue to hopefully be part of that conversation any questions on this one Christie council member buyer hi oh I can't hear you um just to clarify that this bill only applies to dlcd's exception process not to the exception process set forth in the fsec administrative rules for the record time I can answer that um yes uh councilmember buyer that's correct um so just to back up a little um most of lcdc's rules and statutes within FSX land use standard this is where there is a difference um fsec has its own statute lcdc has its own statute or exceptions and then you know lcdc has its rules and then fsec has its rules so that's the one difference and and the big difference is the this is one area you'd asked the question before councilmember Devlin about kind of the comparison this is one area where council's uh requirements are actually less than counties because under the fsec goal does not require an alternative's analysis so that is one one area so this will not apply directly to F sex rule or statute however you know there's a lot of work being done there's a lot of evaluation you know the exceptions you know all the exceptions that we receive are reasons exceptions I can't imagine that the work being done here won't have some influence in how Council reviews and makes determinations on the goal exception and there is a provision in the the bill itself that requires the proposed rules Come to fsec for your not blessing but essentially to share them with you to get your sort of evaluation and comments so you will have a role to play in this rulemaking any questions at this time okay please continue thank you chair Grail and this is the last concept I'm going to talk about I'm not saying bill because it's another one part of one of those two large bills um there was a bill it started out as House Bill 2534 and now it is in house bill 3630 which is where it passed into this is uh state state energy strategy process that the department of energy will lead essentially many other states have a comprehensive State energy strategy to help guide policy makers decision makers in um sort of how to allocate funds or how to figure out which programs the state ought to have to help meet the state's climate goals and so the idea is I kind of think of it as like a puzzle we're going to put together the energy puzzle for the state together and find those gaps and overlaps and come up with um to to decision makers this will not be setting policy but we will be more like a report um and so uh this um will be kind of a big process that the department will be undertaking we absolutely expect citing to be part of that conversation it's definitely an area that is right for conversation given the state's energy goals and so I just wanted to flag it for you all and make sure you know that I think it will come up at that particular table um and um I can kind of just leave it at that it's mostly just like a heads up right now um but I think it would be great to have the folks leading the state energy strategy work on your agenda from time to time periodically as the process and I'll leave it at that I'm happy to answer any other questions and we can go to the last slide none in the room here please continue okay thanks chair girl um my last slide when it goes up I just wanted to make sure folks know that the Oregon Department of energy 2023 legislative report is posted uh the governor is still in the process of signing bills so I'll be sort of um with information about effective dates whether or not those have been signed but sort of consider it here's here's where things were at the end of session and um in fact it looks like the governor signs 31.79 today I just looked it up when Todd was talking um and said if the governor signs it she signed it today sometime so that has um and so like I said she's signing bills now we'll keep posted there but um that report should be helpful to you it has that table that you wanted a copy of um and so that link is in the slide deck and if anyone has any questions for me just feel free to reach out anytime thank you I'm looking around I don't see any additional questions I'd just like to say thank you for providing that and keeping us posted throughout this session I'm sure we will anxiously be watching the outcome of some of the work that was completed thank you Christy thank you chair girl and members of the council have a great rest of your time in Eastern Oregon all right uh next on our agenda is agenda item D we have the appointment of a consultant for exhibit s review this is the historic cultural and archaeological resources this is an action item and we have Sarah esterson senior policy advisor here to present Sarah thank you chair Grail so good evening members of the council again my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy advisor with the Oregon Department of energy citing division and this agenda item today is a request for your review and approval of the Department's use of a specialized consultant to support with review of technical materials for amendments and applications related to the council's archaeological and cultural resources um for a little context we bring this type of request for your review for several reasons we have several statutory Provisions that apply one is that when an independent review is needed statute gives Council the authority to commission support by a consultant statute also gives Council the authority to exercise any additional actions necessary to fulfill their role and we believe we have the need for some consultant support to support your review we also have a statutory obligation to ensure that all of our costs in the citing division are necessary just and reasonable so we bring this request to you as we are going outside of the sighting division to make you know to be transparent and to make sure that you agree and I'll give you a little bit more context about scope and costs here in just a few um so for a little more background the sighting division has an ongoing request for proposal process it is on a five-year cycle where we send out requests for um uh is that called a request for proposal we send out a request for a proposal for consultant a technical environmental consultant support and the most recent cycle was in 2020 and as a result of that process we issue a master Services agreement and then under that Master Services agreement we would then come to council and get authorization for work order contracts so in 2020 the RFP the request for proposal awarded a master Services contract to Haley and Aldrich and then with that two sub-consultants were approved along with Haley and Aldrich which is Golder and historic resources",

        "text": " um with that I'll turn to our last uh uh presentation uh commissioner Decker and um Garrett Martin are with us here from the p uh at our last meeting we touched very briefly um commissioner Decker gave us a bit of an overview of what uh is happening relative to the integrated resource planning that the utilities do and the commission uh assesses but we wanted to it's such an important area of work uh as we discussed in the road map the importance of getting um the programs that are uh in House Bill 2021 that was focused on electric utilities and the the CP P um work that also includes our natural gas utility um getting those uh right uh and making sure that they're uh being supported for Effective implementation is is is really critical so um I think it's important for the commission to continue to kind of keep uh this the work that's needed to to make these things happen front of mine so I appreciate um commissioner Decker's U willingness to kind of give us a deeper view of this work so with that I'll hand it over to you commissioner Decker well thank you so much and I really appreciate those opening remarks because I think they match the message that I'm hoping to get across today and that I um you know have been uh trying to deliver um in this forum uh as we talk more broadly about uh energy and and climate policy um so I'm glad to be here and my goal is to just um give people who are less familiar with the Pu a bit of uh background on utility planning and how the new climate policies come into that space they both change that space and they change the relevance of that space to how Oregon is meeting its climate goals and and so I appreciate the interest in in hearing from us here um as as chair McDonald kind of noted um these uh new policies establishing decarbonization requirements for regulated electric and Natural Gas Utilities have made utility planning processes that we've had in place for a long time um a a central place to talk about how decarbonization is proceeding and what adjustments and supports the utilities need um to accomplish what is really a very big role the state's um climate policy landscape and so my ask is just that you remember ter McDonald uh obviously did with with her opening remarks that utility climate mandates are not um self-executing emissions reductions to to work within affordability and reliability parameters for the energy sector things like state and federal funding support and Regional cooperation um are critical and for from my perspective uh we talk about accelerating climate goals we really need the energy and climate Community to lean in and and learn whether the pieces are in place for the emissions reductions that we've already mandated to to be successful and my presentation will hopefully highlight some ways to get that understanding and if desired to to play a role there um so let's go to my first slide and think somebody else is yeah there we go um this is just some background context um I think everybody knows that the Pu regulates investor and electric and Natural Gas Utilities and that for decades um uh utilities have presented integrated resource plans uh in in our um integrated resource plans are sort of the biggest picture way that uh the utility explains its strategy for selecting a least cost least risk portfolio of resources to meet its customers needs um there are also today um kind of subsidiary planning processes such as planning for the distribution system which is the kind of neighborhood uh scale uh Energy System and uh planning for the the for transportation electrification things like that but integrated resource planning is kind of the big picture balance between the customer loads and the resources and and and how the utility is going to to keep those together um and make good decisions about that over the long term um they happen every two years uh and in between those if there's a resource need uh the utilities the electric utilities anyway will'll have um uh procurement processes that are also overseen by the Miss uh I think everyone knows that for electric utilities HB 2021 is the policy primarily in question and for um Gas Utilities it's the climate protection program that created these decarbonization requirements but if you go to the next slide um you'll get a better picture of the policy Rich environment um let's go to the next slide that we are living in um and there's a lot here and there is a lot it's it's not a it's not a coincidence right right um uh it's really remarkable how different the policy landscape is from you know even uh sort of 2007 which you see on the left side there where what utilities we're planning for is sort of a a particular technology or set of Technologies to have a slice of their resource stack and and as you go sort of across this timeline um uh the policies become much more um climate focused and and sort of holistic and and sort of capturing a number of other objectives besides just Technologies coming onto the system or even a missions Focus um they're really uh capturing justice issues and some uh technology change issues and and you even see on here sort of climate adaptation issues with the Wildfire planning I'll leave you to look at the uh this slide further at your leisure but let's go to the next slide um and and just remember that plans today have to take on all of that policy and and our focusing goal is to make the Pu review process um for utility planning an open and honest dialogue about um whether the utilities are taking the reasonable steps in the right direction um with all of that change uh it's understandable uh that we may not get things everything exactly right um the first time around this slide dives into what um the sort of pu Focus parts of or particularly the Pu focused parts of um HB 2020 2021 are requiring and again um th this uh applies to both um the two major investor owned Utilities in the state as well as um entities that uh provide Power to very large customers that choose not to get their power from from the utilities um I don't want to go into great detail on this I think most people on this uh meeting probably understand what's in um HB 2021 I think I'll just focus on where it says planning and protections there um a major feature of HB 2021 is the requirement that utilities file clean energy plans and those are going to kind of sit either alongside or nested with um the integrated resource plan and um and are going to give us a special focus on a few things that are specific to HP 2021 but also uh to the actions that the ities are taking um to put themselves in a position to to meet those um requirements whether um you know anyway in HB 2021 that that really began in in 2030 with that 80% reduction um there's lots of other things here I think you see HB 2021 had a small scale resources requirement um it it requires a focus on community benefits that that's uh different than what we've had in the past and also um uh offers some local government uh Choice options that didn't exist before and the utilities are working on all of those things along with the commission um but let's move to the next slide and just um take a look at the basic provisions of the climate Protection Program which applies to the Natural Gas Utilities and and so um I don't have much to say here this obviously is a program that um was adopted by uh DEQ um but it's a arguably an aggressive sort of uh reduction in uh emissions from the natural gas sector um over the timeline that you see there um I I think the thing that's worth noting about both of these policies is is that neither one says kind of how the utility has to do it um HB 2021 has a small scale resource requirement but you know the CPP just sort of says you got to get there and um the place functionally right now where the utility is evaluating different options for how they're going to get there is in the integrated resource plan that comes to the Pu so let's H go to the next slide um this slide is here and it'll be familiar from the Tigger road map um but it's here to underscore and I I should have an arrow pointing to the CPP wedge here but the HB 2021 is that you know big blue edge wedge that the um uh the arrow is pointing to and then I'm pretty sure that the um climate Protection Program is the next one there it's a little a little difficult to distinguish the greens but um this is just here to underscore when I say that utility planning plays a big role in uh Oregon meeting its climate goals it's it's because that is to my ey more than half of the emissions reductions that we're seeing on any any particular uh place in in the timeline and um and and I and I think that kind of uh speaks for itself um commissioner deer you're very correct that second Wes CPP okay wonderful um all right let's move to the next slide um with one caveat that most of those the uh that's the remaining um climate protection programs after you take out Cafe clean fuels program clean fuel program expansion Advanced Clean cars two trucks Advanced Clean cars two so all of those the pink one second one from the bottom uh or pink one up through the green one or all okay I think it's fair to say that the green represents the the um uh the slice that utility um uh integrated resource plans from the gas companies are solving for I think that's that's the point I guess I'm trying to make um so let's go to the next slide and um this is a forward-looking slide I I will say that we are uh not starting as the pucr efforts uh this year I want to note that in Prior years we have uh accomplished such Preparatory activities as uh what we called the natural gas fact finding process where we tried to uh bring in a broader stakeholder Community to an understanding of um uh the Gas Utilities and the amount of sort of assets and infrastructure um that uh they're working with and and and and started to explore um big picture uh the suite of strategies for um decarbonization and and uh you know now in the context of the uh climate Protection Program although that wasn't uh finalized when we started that um we also have been preparing for implementation of HB 2021 um by uh running a process to help um stakeholders and and utilities focus on the parts of HB 2021 that were particularly new and different from the planning processes that have",

        "text": " a working class bar. I have a lot of people. Electricians, plumbers, concrete guys, tree trimmer guys, landscape. They work until 607:00 by the time they get home, shower, get the wife, kids together, go on out to the restaurant. It's already a late start, you know, so having those later hours, it's essential for the success of the bar and our business. So, you know, it's essential to us staying afloat, I believe. And you know, we keep. We're keeping close eyes on everything. I'll admit that there was a complaint and part of it was it's my fault for not keeping track of the time and cutting entertainment off at the time that they were supposed to. But they get requests to keep playing and time ran out from and I dropped the ball. I will own that. You know, that is, that is on me. And since then I made sure that we do not go. I pay close attention to the time and I hate to cut you off. Yes sir, we got that part pretty good. Any questions from the commission to this gentleman or the applicant? Any additional items or. All right, thank you. It's just our owner, Mister Wilson is here, so if he wants to come up. Hi, Chris Wilson, 1010 Southeast 24th Street Ocala, Florida 34471. Guys, I just want to let you know we're handling this responsibly. Responsibly. We had a one whiff when which stayed up a little late one night. We were busy. And since that time we closed the music down at ten when we originally got the permit. You'll see that in the old pictures. There was no roof on the enclosure. We were rejected for a permit four times and we made concessions with the city, which apparently don't get recorded. About closing the music down at ten, about closing the business at twelve, and about just not having drums or not having bandst. And after going through this process, we were approved for the screen enclosure. Again, regardless of all that, we're going to handle it responsibly. We're going to do the right thing. We've built two businesses, county line and anchor out of businesses that were frankly not great for the area or not great for the community. And we, you can look at our businesses, there's signs on the wall that says no drugs or anything illicit. And I don't even call it a bar anymore. I call them restaurants. Both our restaurants do well over 50% in food sales. And again, people of women, men, children, this is not the old county line and the old fat daddies at all. So give us a chance on this. 110 o'clock is important. Sunday's a lake day. The guys love to get down on the lake and come out to county line and enjoy some great karaoke, some great food, and we're much more affordable than some other places. Not as good of you. So anyway, I think we're doing the right thing here. And I do hope you give us a chance on this entire thing. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I had one item, one individual sign up. Joseph Walker. You guys again, my name is Joseph Walker. I live at 188220 Southeast 54th place, oklahoma, Florida 32179. And I was at Jacob enforcement the other day here last week when I had this meeting on here. So today I went down and pulled the permit on here that he took out. They bought it in 2020, 2021. It took out a permit. You got a screen up there? You show this up on here, it says right on the permit, no wild side music. Now what's the problem? You know, why are we here? Because they violated the rules and now they want you guys to come in here and give them a permit. Go ahead and do it. Anyhow, if we spend all that money on here getting code enforcement in here, have to go on out there time and time again. And I haven't seen a police report in here. Why isn't there a police report here? Says what's going on in this property? I just don't understand why we keep on playing with these people on here that come in here and they do a song and dance in front of you guys and you okay it? So you got any questions? Hat any questions? I think we're good. Thank you. You're welcome. Is there anyone else in the audience that would like to address the commission on this item? Yes, sir. And that's for the screened enclosure, the canopy over. Correct. So in b two zoning, all uses are intended to be with the fully enclosed building. I think really the question would be because we don't count screens as enclosures, so that's why we're here today. And that permit was for the screen enclosure? Yes. We do have provisions for restaurants to have seating outside, but that does not include entertainment. All right, name and address? Hi, my name is Matt Grohl. I'm the airport director of the city of Ocala, 1770 Southwest 60th Avenue, suite 603 4474. So I was asked to come today and speak as a character reference for Mister Wilson and his ownership team. As the landlord at elevation 89, I've been in that role for two years now, and I've learned a lot about the industry. Mister Wilson and his ownership team, they have six other restaurants. They're all individually branded, serving different clientele. But the one thing that's been consistent is the ownership team and the responsiveness to any issues that might come up. And speaking specifically at elevation, 89, they're not afraid to make changes and spend money to fix anything that's been wrong. They've spent a lot of it out at elevation, but they know what works and they know what doesn't work. And they've asked, they've cut out what hasn't worked, and they've expanded on what does work. They've been a great community partner at the airport, and they're a strong contributor to the culture at the airport. Be happy to answer any questions. Any questions. Thank you. Anyone else in the audience that would like to address the commission on this item? Okay, come on back. Yes, sir. Before answering any questions, I just wanted to touch on the note on the permit guy, and I will agree on this. From time to time. Things are relayed later about conversations that occur during a permitting process, whether it's between an applicant and a staff member and maybe mistaken or misconstrued. At the end of the day, I can tell you, and I'm only telling you this so that you understand that he comes from a place of perhaps either hearing something that was inconsistent with the code of, or understanding something to be inconsistent with the code. If he made sure that there were no bans and it was just simply acoustic and karaoke, that it would be fine within the screened enclosure, that is not, as I've told him, a license to continue that activity. Right. If it violates the code. Thus, we're here today. We're trying to put nice guardrails on disuse, because it can make sense for a little community restaurant to offer some music without violating our noise ordinance. And I want to point out that one of the conditions of approval that we've recommended is, obviously, if we are found to have violated the code and the noise ordinance, then that's a violation of the special use permit. So we have built in a short leash for ourselves, and we'd ask you to trust them to approve it. All right, back to the commission. Code enforcement. Code enforcement. Summer, Jameson. Thank you. Can you just tell us about the case and how you were received by the applicant? You went, yeah, I just want to know if they were compliant with you when you talk to them. What is. They still have outdoor music. They've had it since I opened this case back in May. I believe it was first. Yeah, I saw that it was a few months ago. So you told them that it was back on May 1, that we got the complaint, and I went out on Thursday following notice of violation. They got the notice of violation. I handed it to Chris in the office when he came in to speak with us on May 16 is when the letter is dated. And did you talk to them when you were on site that they needed to shut the music off or shut it down? Not the night that I went out there and got them at the levels. I went out the next day and did give them a citation, a warning citation for the loud music. Okay. And then what happened next? I believe it was the following day. Hold on 1 second. This was dated May 15. So he did come in on the 16th. He got the notice of violation, showing that he is in violation of the ordinances for having the outdoor music. And then he continued having outdoor entertainment till code board. They. We had to withdraw the case from codeboard, but they are pending this hearing. But as of your knowledge, they're still in violation? Yes, sir. I went out, I believe it was August. Yes, August 4. And they were still having outdoor entertainment. So, Rob, this is the problem. I never understand about these cases that we get on. You know, that they're running when our enforcement goes out there, give you the violation, why don't they stop until they get it resolved or stop until, you know, they come before us? Even when you were out there this weekend, right? Yeah. Yes. I never do under quite understand that. If the code enforcement officer came out to me and said, hey, you guys are",

council will approve the minutes of july 23 2021 meeting as presented thank you hanley i'll second that this is ken thank you kent is there any discussion i will remind everyone that i'm using my phone so i probably won't see you if you raise your hand todd's going to be on the lookout but um if you speak up i won't be offended if you speak without being caught on so if you have any comments please do madam chair i see councilmember condon has her hand up thanks todd cindy yes thank you in the minute sorry i'm i'm using two computers in the minutes um there's a comment of mine where um about where we um rely on staff for that in the order of review of our and i wanted to be clear about that obviously we rely on staff for a lot for all of the standards um it was outside of um you know where we have other agencies involved in the review like fish and wildlife and it was the standards like the financial responsibility and the organizational it's not another agency it's us um determining that i just wanted to make that clear i know we rely on staff for information on every standard um and so it just was not clear in the minutes that that's what um i was after what's happening are you interested in making any changes to that yes it was it would be sorry i'm just trying to find it it's um page nine sorry where it says uh council member condon express preference for standards where the council is relying on staff to provide the necessary information that um staff od odo staff rather than outside um agencies like fish and wildlife and that that was my preference um okay so sorry i'm trying to find the location so i can sorry it's it is right before the 2021 legislative uh session fsec related bills and in the minutes it's the sorry i don't have a page number on my looks like it's page three okay so the sentence is councilmember connor express preference for standards where the council is relying on staff to provide the necessary information is that the your wanting to change it to staff only odo staff what i'm concerned about is um well um sorry i didn't um give thought to how i'd like it worded it's um the standards that rely on um odu odo e and council only to make a decision for instance the corporate uh the um organizational expertise to my knowledge you know we're not going to for instance the corporations division or another division to do an analysis to say yes this is a company that has the organizational expertise i realize that staff odo staff does it with respect to projects but the depth of the financial stability or experience of the organization that's excuse me this is handling and this may be my fault i ask donette to take the word counsel out before the word staff so it would read council member condon express preference for standards where the council is relying on council staff to provide the necessary information would that make it more clear so then it's our staff yes i think that would do it neither that or the department of energy staff either one yeah either either well either maybe that i don't the department of energy staff yeah let's do department of energy because the council council is what confused me that seems a totally a little clear in mind so yeah i made that uh change to add so then the sentence would now read council member con express preference for standards where the council is relying on relying on department of energy staff to provide the necessary information right yeah yeah i'd agree to that yeah does that work for you cindy yes thank you you initially made the motion and now we've got a mod a correction a friendly amendment i don't know what we're going to call it friendly amendments this is ken and i will second uh the friendly amendment all right for in the motion as well as in the draft uh minutes as well so i can i think it's pretty clear in terms of the so i don't have any concerns about that thank you todd all right any further comments or questions on the minutes carrying none mr secretary please call the role can't help hanley jenkins yes jordan truitt i would like to vote yes but i was not present uh should i abstain from my vote yeah i think that's appropriate i will abstain from voting perry chuck dude i think councilmember chuck toot is with us now is that correct anita that is correct councilmember talk toot was on mute he should be good now okay uh yeah just have to abstain on that mr that's right got it cindy conan marcy grill motion carries madam chair thank you the next agenda item relates to the boardman to hemingway transmission line since i've previously recused myself on all boardman the hemingway action items i'm similarly going to recuse myself on agenda items b and c and turn over the running of those items to vice chair howe vice chair how if you will please pick up i would appreciate it if i made just one secretary report oh gosh sorry jumped right over you todd right my apologies and it is your prerogative if you don't want a secretary report today that is okay by me as well no we want to hear from you i just skipped over you looking at my bright red note sorry no no problem first is uh council updates so the next legislative days are scheduled for september 22nd 23rd and 24th that means that there could be possible replacements replacements for council jenkins and winters however at this point i have not received any definitive updates about whether names are putting being put forward by the governor to the senate rules committee um so it could be that that both council member jenkins and councilmember winters are replaced it could be that one of them is replaced it could be that neither one of them is replaced and so we're just kind of on hold waiting to find out um from where where that's at and i know councilmember jenkins has indicated that he would be unavailable for the september council meeting anyway unless we need a quorum um but at this point we've heard from all other council members outside of council member winners and so we do have fives indicated availability for september so we should be fine regardless of what next i'll get into some project updates the first is on the boardman hemingway transmission line so as part of the council packet the two weeks ago in the initial council packet we provided you with the contested case update from the hearing officer so unless you have any questions about that i will just let the update from the hearing officer stand and move on to the next project update okay so you know the boardman solar energy facility amendment determination request that's the next one on my list so this project is an approved 75 megawatt solar pv facility on 798 acres so 1.25 square miles it's located in northwestern morro county the site certificate holder is currently seeking their first amendment which would extend the beginning in construction deadlines by three years the amendment request itself does not include any substantive changes just changes to the beginning and ending construction deadlines as part of their amendment they did request type b review on august 12th the department determined that type b was justified for this the justification for that was based on an evaluation of any changes of factor law that occurred between the time the council originally approved the facility and determined that there was not any any substantive changes in fact or law there was minimal interest by the public and all of the issues that were raised by reviewing agencies were addressed so based upon that assessment overall i can get into the specifics if anybody has the uh we the department determined that type b was justified and made that determination and that determination was sent to council on the same date august 12th as well so it's just a reminder the way that that process works is once the staff makes the determination only the applicant under type b can the review of that to council so that one holds unless the applicant or the certificate holder themselves wants to raise that to next on my list is the bonanza energy facility this is a proposed 150 to 300 megawatt solar pv project with up to 1100 megawatts of battery storage the facility would be located on 2700",

        "text": " of criteria so again sustainable legal Equitable um not negative impacts on the local economy uh not negative impacts on the environment um administrative effort and then proven torque elsewhere in uh in Oregon or how you all ranked the different criteria options so putting them up against um kind of what we learned from the focus groups uh so folks kind of resoundingly there's a lot of agree um agreement between these two groups on this sustainability so a very high level of importance placed on whether or not different options can create ongoing Revenue sources versus onetime onetime options or things that may need to be renewed um or go up for a vote kind of periodically um then there was a little bit of a difference so Equity came in second for focus groups and came in third for this group um and then we didn't ask this group cuz it was a little bit of a gimme but we did ask the focus groups about um how important the estimated Revenue potential was for each one of these so that was very interesting that that ended up third uh and not first so just something to kind of take into consideration when you're looking at this decision-making framework um local economy kind of ended up impact on the economy and the environment ended up in similar positions um for both this task force and also the focus group um and then legal viability for the focus group kind of lower towards the bottom the other thing that we ask focus groups is that impact timeline so again when results would be realized and their level of importance rated on having near-term midterm or long-term uh impacts or results um then everybody agreed we don't really care whether or not it has been successful in other cities lower level Imports We Care a little bit um not as much as the other ones though so any in these results surprise you any questions that you have when you thinking about putting together a decision making framework using this criteria to evaluate different options forward how would you assess impact on the economy thanks n yeah for instance some of these wouldn't we have some other tasks Downstream before we uh make that decision yep economy and environment partly I'm an economist so I I really want some advice here how to behave in case I ever get a consulting job I'm gonna call Kai risdall uh and have him call you back personally yes um I also met a brilliant economist working with another uh project who lives in Oregon so his name is Dallas and I think if you're going to be an economist you just automatically get a very cool name like Dallas or Kai so I'll have them give you a call but that's a good question right so impact on the economy uh to what extent is that being evaluated and understood and measured and then also impact in the environment um to what degree are we also evaluating that when we're kind of putting together a decision-making criteria because it could get very very nuanced very yeah it's a great Point yes was there any discussion um in the focus groups about the breadth of our um tax measures so for example um should it only be residents of Salem or could we also tax people from the outside did they talk about that at all no um not in the context of who should be taxed um a lot of the conversation we were thinking about who this might apply to actually uh centered on entities that um use the services within the city so thinking at um there's a lot of conversation around so the legislative uh proposal out there to um recoup some funds um for services um provided by the City of Salem and then there was also a lot of conversation around kind of Salem's uh unique uh real estate environment um housing a lot of government offices not for-profits a lot of other entities that would be exempt from other property tax and so thinking about how that might compare you know not whether or not Revenue generating are successful in other cities but what their real estate um kind of landscape looks like so that was the conversation but we didn't get into um who should be tasked uh taxed or who it would apply to as people as residents or okay so thinking about using this information one of the things we'd like you all to discuss and then ultimately vote on tonight is if we were going to is to potentially adopt um a set of criteria that can be used to evaluate different Revenue generating options in the future so the discussion for you tonight is um what if any changes would you make to the proposed criteria and so of the two options we're going to start with what was provided to you in the survey and then maybe talk about some the other two options that were asked of the focus groups so that estimated Revenue potential and then also the impact timeline if those are important or if they are not important to include in a decision-making criteria and then if there is anything that you feel like shouldn't be included in a decision-making framework as yes could you talk to us a little bit about how you envision us using this decision-making criteria in terms of uh when we get to those Revenue options right like what's the we've got this rubric how are we filling out this rubric how are we using it to kind of move forward in that decision-making process yeah great question I'd love to tell you so we had envisioned using this criteria really similar honestly to how a risk assessment gets put together so you have each one of these categories and then within each category you would have different options of um some are binary options yes no and so that would be associated with a number a score similar to how these were um ranked using kind of those weighted averages um and then thinking about for the other ones putting them against kind of a low low to moderate moderate moderate to high high impact and then having each one of those pieces so really starting with this and then building out each of the different options within it and then assigning those a number so that then when we kind of talking through a lot of the different Revenue generating options we can put these pieces together end up with a score or end up with a rating or a ranking that can be used to start putting them into a prioritize list these ones are very viable these are the ones we want to pursue these are the ones we want to fold into a so then you can start grouping them together um and start to understand what needs to come together in order to hit some of these yet to be determined targets there will be visuals in the future so let's start the conversation with looking at the two other criteria that were proposed to the task force or to the focus groups I apologize so estimated Revenue potential and then impact timeline when you think of including that as kind of a a criteria to evaluate different Revenue generating options against does one or both of these feel like they're important to include in kind of a rubric yes I mean the short answer is is yes but but I mean when I I think of something like U the the the estimated Revenue um like we're after the cost of collections if if we're looking at things that are under a million dollars it's probably not worth our time to to to even just have that in our discussion is from my point of view at least um and maybe even in a higher number than a million dollars and then the estimated time when you look at the the there's things we could we could do say like urban renewal districts we could say let's get rid of the urban Ral District we don't need right now make that as one of our suggestions um and that's like $3 million and that's something that could come back as my understanding of it very quickly into the city budget but long term you know that's that's a horrible decision for a city to make to not have urban renewal districts but in the short term um it could be actually a really good decision as other things ramp up because it's going to any one of I mean most of these that have any significant Revenue are are not going to be around in year one or even probably year two of us doing this so um anyway that was my thoughts on that Scott Canton wi just just returning to the question that I asked earlier uh with respect to potential aligned with each proposed Revenue generating option that's just basic business analysis I don't I don't think we can judiciously consider any one of these options without saying this even even if we have a range to know this is what this option I'm just going to pick on franchise fee fee increase this is going to raise $5 million this is going to cost $1 more million to administer the net gain to the general fund is $4 million if we don't have that information we're just playing house right so using that as an evaluation criteria that's a great Point thinking about is there any threshold that would be too low where it would um cause a different option to be dis included or excluded oh my goodness y'all excluded is there a threshold that is too low to we a different op where an option would be excluded from a recommendation and if the answer is no there is no threshold too low as long as it would result in a net gain for the city then you could think about um including it as then you wouldn't need it as an evaluation criteria it's simply is a part of the analysis which I think is what you're getting at I think that goes part and parcel with if we're using sustainability as a criteria part of analyzing the long-term sustainability of option a option b option C is knowing how much estimated can this generate and then sustainability talks specifically about whether it would be a onetime Thing versus an ongoing um Revenue generating yeah Becky ban I think maybe if you did the scorekeeping without those two factors and then laid them out into a plan and said well these would these would give you uh income quickly these not this one is a small thing that's at the same time as some big things so let's toss it because it's more trouble than it's worth that might be the time to do it not in the scoring part but in the putting together of a whole picture yeah exactly so what of what are those pieces um that you want to make sure are under consideration when you're putting together your menu yeah yes um I saw uh yeah Beth first and Keith Beth Vargus Duncan I agree thank you this is Keith Norris I was going to um actually disagree a little bit and the thought that uh you could have in terms of the rubric situation right have one of those scores be does it raise less",

        "text": " Yeah, what do you call it? Variants or something. He never did that. No, in here. On here they put it in here. He had 615 other properties. This man knows what the laws are. And now we're going to come along and just say, oh, my goodness, back here. We stick a couple years on here now. Now we're going to give him his. Let him get by without paying the fine, you know, on this. This is unreal. But we keep on doing it, and I keep on coming up here and complaining about her, and I'll be here until February of 2028 on it. So let's just keep on doing this here. And we do is what we're doing here is we're making code enforcements doing their job. And you come along here and drag the feet on. They drag their feet on getting taken care of. And then you come in here and drop the lien. You know, it's a revolving door. That's what you got here. And we just keep on going and going and going. It isn't about time. We come along here and we look at the facts on here. When we have a problem with some property here on it, we look at it here, and before it comes in front of the board here, you review it and says you're going to deny it or whatever it is if you don't on here, we don't need these. Keep on coming here and doing it over and over and again, and we just keep dropping it. Thank you, Mister Walker. You're welcome. Is there anyone else in the audience who has an item that you would like to address? Brock Gibbony, 597 northeast 45th Terrace, Ocala. Item seven seven two, Cal Ripken, baseball World Series for the eight and under is coming here. This is, I believe, the 8th World Series that we've had here in Marion county. We started that sportsplex back in 97. Your husband was very well, Commissioner stone. Well involved with us through our rotary clubs. But what we've done through an amazing public private partnership. The city, the county, the state of Florida, and the Rotary clubs here all put that together. And so much was given by businesses, especially the Marion County Road builders, to build the facility, which is next to Forest high school. But through these years, we provided something for the families, for the children, and children learning team sports, learn how to work with others, rather than being just caught up within themselves all the time. And I'm just so thankful that we do have this available. It's continued to run well in cooperation with the Marion County Recreation Department and the private sector, which the parents and other people supporting the baseball that's played out there. So thank you very much for what's been done. And if you have any interest, get involved. Talk to parks and rec, talk to the people who are running the league out there, because it's doing some great, great stuff. And the economic impact of these types of group. I remember the first one we had was a southeast regional, and back then it was a 200, no, excuse me, $400,000 economic impact on our area. It's now grown over the millions whenever we have these things, because kids from all over the country come and they travel well with parents and grandparents. Thank you. Well, thank you Mister Gibiney, and thank you for your tireless work to bring this into fruition for this community as well. God bless you, sir. Is there anyone else okay with that? We will close that portion of our agenda and we will move to item number three, which is to adopt the following sets of minutes. We've got December 19, 2023, a and b. Second got a motion by commissioner McLean, second by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Item number four is nothing. And item number five has quite a few. Mister clerk, I'll send it to you. 5.1. Good morning, madam Chair. And thank you have for the board's consideration and adoption budget amendment resolution items 511 through 517. Thank you, Mister clerk. I'll bring it back to the board for action. Madam chair. I'll go ahead and move for approval, but with that, I would like to just say a quick comment about item 519. How exciting to see that funding being moved over to get started on our new animal services facility. And I think it's a great day in Marion county. Amen. We are actually building it, right? We are actually building it. Surprise. For the record, we are moving $5,270,500 from reserves to the new animal center construction project. Thank you, Mister clerk. And I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant. 2nd, 2nd by Commissioner McLean. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you. Thank you, madam Chair. Next, have project adjustment, item 521 for the board's consideration and approval. So moved. Second motion by Commissioner O'Bryant. Second by Commissioner McLean. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, madam Chair. Finally, have item 531, which is a request for disposition of property, including some property related to the KP hole, the tax collector's office, animal Services. Moved? Second. Got a motion by Commissioner McLean. Second by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Madam Chair, if I may. Bless you. It was an item for approval only. Item 1.7. It was a proclamation regarding a recent Eagle Scout. If I may, Edwin Jett Green is a young man in troop 72. That my son is a member of Sandy Clarky's. The scoutmaster. Just would like to say that Jett is a fine young man who spent much of the first two years of his life in shands with a brain tumor. And for to see him nearing graduation in high school and obtain his eagle scout. His father is an eagle. His grandfather is an eagle. So it's a really amazing story. And it's just a neat testament to his family sticking with him and doctors supporting him and the scout community supporting him. But he is the one that needs to be celebrated for just such a fine accomplishment. I'm very proud of him. Thank you. Thank you for adding that. And I'm sure one of us will be presenting that on his behalf. That would be fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. That is going to take us to our consent items. And I'll start with Commissioner McLean. Do you have anything you'd like to have pulled? No. No, ma'am. Commissioner Bryant. I am good. Okay. All of my questions has also been answered. So we are looking for action to move the consent agenda. Thank you so much. Got a motion by Commissioner McLean to move the consent. 2nd, 2nd by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Mister Attorney, I know it says none, but I'm going to ask. Do you have anything? Nothing today. Thank you. Very good. And we've already taken care of nine two. But Mister Boyones, we've got nine one. Item nine one, commissioner, again, it's a request for release of Lien and Mister Verde will give us the details. Very good. Mister Veridon. Good morning, commissioners. Chuck Veridan, director of Gulf Services. So, item 9.1, as stated, was a release lien. This is for a code enforcement case. Case number is 875167. Partial id is 4716 014019. A little bit of background on this one. Mister Fred Rothdeh purchased the property via quit claim deed on March 31, 2021. There was a complaint about a used mobile home on the site without a building permit. And, excuse me, long story short, the code enforcement board imposed a fine on August 10, 2022. The mobile home was removed and cleared. The violation December 28, 2023. Mister Roth requested a rescission lien February 14 of this year. The code enforcement board heard the case and. And they are recommending denial. Part of their. What they said was there was a realtor, Mister Scott Archibald appeared on behalf of the owner of Fred Roth at the case. And the chairman of the code enforcement board said that he advised Mister. Mister Archibald that it's hard to recommend, to reduce or resend the lien when the owner wasn't the person who cleared the violation. And then Mister Roth has stated that he hired a mobile home company to install the mobile home on his lot and thought they were going to take care of the permitting. So. And then the numbers. The comb for small world lien is $6,000. The administrative fees, which are their hard costs, are $203.59 for a total of $6,203.59. The market and assess value is $16,215. And the recommendation of staff is to deny in the comparison board. Thank you, Mister Verdon. Did anyone inspect the paperwork, the documentation that Mister Roth had paid to the person who was supposed to set that mobile home up and apply for all of the permitting? I don't know that, but I can find out. That's fine. Is Mister Roth in the audience? He said he was going to be here, coming forward. Mister Roth? Yes",

        "text": " seen that require sewer and and lots of buildings multiple rows that are really more permanent conversions of land solar is a temporary conversion of land if water comes back like we all hope it does in Klamath County and it's more profitable for that land to go back to farming those farmers can end their leases and um you know when the when the solar lease is up and they can return that land back to agriculture very easily so please do keep that in mind when we're talking about our current climate crisis and the balance that we really need to have to protect those lands by addressing the climate crisis um so like I said the the we we should be making some exceptions to our Landing schools really because of the climate um the report mentioned that the exception used for many of these projects is because they're close to transmission and we believe that should should be a notable exception and a worthwhile exception because our land use schools did not anticipate that being a need for projects like this and really for renewable projects so um it is it is exceptional that these projects do have very particular land use needs needing to be cited close to transmission which is different really than other types of development um and I wanted to address the again the difference in soils and where is the best place for solar projects to be developed we're getting to a place now where it is very challenging to find those perfect spots when it comes to soil wildlife and other concerns if we if solar is prevented from being built on arable lands then the solar gets pushed onto more marginal lands and remember that that's where our Wildlife is and so um you know if solar is pushed from one use to another pretty soon we're ending up in the situation where everybody says sure we want solar but not here and all of a sudden you have you don't have places left and so we really need to think about all our uses of land and the future of the climate crisis and how it's affecting all of those uses and how we can hopefully present prevent some of the worst of those impacts one of the most promising pieces of solar is agrovoltaics which was mentioned and there was a question about it um it's very promising Oregon state is actually one of the leaders in the country on agricult Research they have research right now happening outside of their campus and cornballis and I wanted to note that the LOI that was mentioned for that large solar project in Linn County is looking at Agri voltaics that area right now is being used for grass seed farming and they the developers are looking into continuing grass seed farming and also having sheep grazing under those panels so there are ways to keep the land in active agriculture while having solar there I'll also note that Hillary mentioned that well she categorized it as developers would not take advantage of the dlcd option for agricultix but actually the the rules that dlcd passed required counties to pass ordinances about agricults first and counties only had two years to do that and no County was able to pass those ordinances in the two years developers would have loved to have worked with counties to have a more robust agribel take ordinances by two years just wasn't enough time to complete that we still hope to see more agroval Techs in Oregon and I think the new project that Todd mentioned with the LOI will be a great example about of um next I'd like to say um we do have already a very vigorous process both at the county and of course here at the council you all work very hard to make sure that all of the um all of the teas are across and the eyes are dotted to make sure that these um all fit the requirements and meet the meet all the all the rules and guidelines set out it's a little deceptive I think to look at total acreage and it's helpful to remember that every single project and all of those acres has gone through a very diligent process of which you all are a big part of and a reminder too that just because projects are permitted doesn't mean that those projects will be developed developing solar projects and other renewable projects is very complicated and financially risky and getting a permit is only one stage in the process right now um because of the lack of transmission finding that space to interconnect to the grid and to be able to send your power through the grid is a major roadblock and so it's a little deceptive to look at permitted acres and it's not necessarily telling you what the future of those projects will be so in conclusion just um I'll do my own looking forward we want to make sure that looking forward we're doing all we can to address the climate crisis and protect all of the uses of land that we have here at Oregon um and a reminder that while of course my organization would like to see as much solar belt in Oregon as possible for our Economic Development benefits and property tax benefits and job benefits that's just not going to happen uh solar is being developed mainly in other states because it is so challenging to develop solar and Oregon and so when we think about our State climate goals it's good to remember that not all of that renewable energy will be built in Oregon there's a lot of interest right now in wind in Montana and Wyoming and Idaho and so you know we're we're really a national and Regional grid and so not uh not everything will be built here in Oregon as much as we'd like to see those Economic Development impacts well thank you for your time I really appreciate it and I'm happy to answer any questions thank you Angela are there any questions for Angela chair Grill this is Kent yes Elsa miss a Crowley Koch uh what was the organization that you're speaking for Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association you can see our logo behind the Oregon solar one more time and storage got it Industries Association okay thank you very much thank you other questions just to reiterate on how to raise your hand in WebEx in case you were wanting to participate at the bottom of the right main window is a set of icons click on the participants in the bottom right participant window is a hand icon if you click on that that will raise your hand clicking it again will lower your hand if you're using the call-in feature press star 3 on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and you would press star 3 again to lower your hand um I really don't have a question for uh Miss what was your name I forgot let's see it's Crowley cook Crowley College um but I do get a statement um I'm a lifetime resident of Oregon and I come from several generations of Lifetime oregonians and what my main concern is um sure we want clean energy in Oregon but we want to utilize the energy that's created in Oregon and in Oregon if you look at the grid the Bonneville power grid it goes straight to California even our own Cogen Planet if you look at their grid it comes out and does a horseshoe and goes right to California so my concern is that we need to use our energy here in Oregon not to send to California we use some but not what we should we should use a lot more energy so much energy is produced in uh the rate pairs should be paying minuscule bills rather than high bills and as of 07 we paid a surcharge for dam removal on every power bill you know so we're constantly feeling the brunt of the cost of power but we don't get a get the benefits that it should provide given the energy that is produced in Oregon so I just wanted to say that and I really thank you for your presentation and uh um I'm sure we'll have another one sometime in the future so thank you very you're welcome that's a really great Point um and it sort of points to the fact that California passed all these clean energy laws before Oregon did and so that's part of the reason you see some of our energy produced in Oregon heading to California but now of course we have our own laws a stronger renewable portfolio standard 100 clean electricity standard by 2040 and so I think this is going to change and we're going to see more of Oregon's energy produced in Oregon staying in Oregon thank you Nancy's anyone else raised their hand I do not have anyone with their hand raised Madam chair thank you last call for public comments hearing none or seeing nun via Nancy I'm going to close the public comment period at 1004. thank you everyone for your participation and again Angela thank you for joining us with your observations uh it is now time for a short break if council members are up for that um so my question to everyone is would you like 10 or 15 minutes 10 ought to do that's just a second thank you Vice chair house since he spoke first we are going with that it's 1005 if you would please be ready to resume at 10 15. I would appreciate it thank you all right the time is 10 16 and we are ready to resume with our next agenda item which is an overview of council's organizational expertise and financial Assurance standard this is an information item and we have Patrick Rowe the Oregon Department of Justice senior Assistant Attorney General and Council to fsec to present Patrick the floor is yours thank you chair Grail at the outset I'll note that I've been having some connection problems this morning so if if I drop off suddenly uh I'll try to get back as as quickly as I I'm going to be walking through as you mentioned uh the two Council two of council standards organizational expertise and retirement and financial I'll provide an overview of the standards I'll talk about documents that applicants typically provide to demonstrate compliance with those we'll talk about conditions that Council must include in the site certificate regarding these standards talk about conditions that Council has often included and at the end we'll talk about whether get your input and see if you're comfortable with the existing rules and conditions or if there's anything that you think we could do to improve that next slide please Nancy so first we're going to talk about organizational expertise this is the a simple way to look at this standard is it asks is the applicant qualified do they have the expertise to construct operate and retire facility that they're proposing so you'll note on this slide I've highlighted that it says you Council must find that the applicant has that expertise but it also says that Council may consider the applicant's access to technical expertise why does that matter next slide please Nancy it matters",

        "text": "Commissioners and back to you chair hton great welcome to the afternoon session of the Washington County Board of Commissioners work session for March 2024 commissioner Willie is excused today so you have four of the five of us we have just a couple of uh agenda topics remaining uh for this afternoon and the first one is to go over ment program policy update right thank you chair Harrington uh good afternoon Commissioners for the record my name is Matt Curry I'm Washington County's economic development manager and joining me is Aon Doyle senior government relations manager yes we'll be talking today about the Sip the Strategic investment program uh specifically the County's policy and updates to that policy so we are here today uh because uh we are fully expecting that um there's going to be new Investments the semiconductor industry here in Washington County following the chips act at the federal level um and uh so we we're working to update the county SI policy to prepare for that so the Sip is one of the most critical tools that we have here in Oregon to support Advanced manufacturing and semiconductor uh companies um today's uh presentation we're going to do a brief recap of the previous discussions that we've had with with your board uh about the County's zp policy and then we're going to uh talk about some of those changes and look to discuss those proposed updates uh to the County's uh SI policy with a focus specifically on the program objectives section so policy questions for today's presentation are do these proposed changes sufficiently and accurately capture your board's direction for an updated CIP policy and uh do you direct County staff to make the proposed C policy changes and bring the updated policy to your board for future so we just have a couple slides here uh to talk about the Sip uh Tool uh CP is a unique economic incentive uh it's focused on traded sector businesses that make substantial local Investments uh in fact the minimum investment amount actually after the last legislative session 2023 legislative session I should say not the short session minimum investment would be $150 million of which uh aund million the first hundred million are treated like uh like other taxes in our in our taxed uh there is this persistent myth um that companies that use the Sip do not pay property taxes um in fact um companies that use sip we have three here in Washington County right now are some of the largest taxpayers uh property taxpayers here in Washington County um on the slide you'll see some limited data you'll see this is from 2015 to 2021 some of the DAT that we were able to gather for this presentation that really demonstrates um some of the fiscal and financial impact of these Investments you can see that thousands of jobs um over $41 million in property taxes and over 270 million dollars in special fees so that's of course more than that um given that we have a limited uh time range there why why is sip important sip is important for a number of different reason reasons uh it is um Oregon's uh most substantial investment tool and helps us keep uh competitive with other regions so when uh semiconductor companies and other Advanced manufacturing companies are looking to locate um a new Factory a new Fab a new research uh facility they're looking all across the country and actually in many cases all across the world and Z is uh one way that we can uh invest and help bring them to Oregon zp is also uh important uh because it creates high- wage jobs um jobs created under uh sips uh are higher than the average wage here in Washington County and have quite uh the premium um across the board and compared to other uh Industries um the third point I have here in the slide is talking about economic Mobility so economic Mobility is the concept that people are able to move to a higher economic status over the course for their lifetimes uh a recent study um showed that wage premiums uh in the semiconductor industry here in Oregon uh of which shs are primarily focused are higher than all other Industries uh and interestingly I'll point out that this study showed that wage premiums for bip talk workers workers of color were substantially higher than their peers in other Industries especially those with Associates and bachelor's degrees so it's not just uh PhD and folks with master's degrees that are benefiting from these positions it's uh it's really providing a career ladder for folks across the Washington County Community uh the graphic on this slide illustrates those 9,300 jobs that I showed on the previous uh slides so those are the jobs that are created with the current three sits that we have two with Intel and one Genentech this is a a timeline of our conversation with your board about the Count's SI policy so just a little bit of orientation to today's discussion maybe I should have had this one earlier excuse me my slide deck little out of order here this afternoon um so we first came to your board in July of 2023 with a sip overview you'll recall that we had a consultant here that talked about this tool in depth in September we uh brought some initial changes your board had a discussion about some of those initial uh initial changes and modifications of policy and then here we are today March 12th I can't believe it's 2024 uh moving into Q2 here already uh where we have modifications um to the to the policy um for for your board we do um have we have included the updated changes to the sit policy uh in your packet it's Pages 280 to 287 in your packet so um so all of that text is in there all that proposed text so Washington County's s policy for those uh in the public and the audience here is a policy that was created in 2006 to guide the County's negotiations with company's interested in doing a sip agreement uh with the county has h four sections it's a pretty short policy uh it's it's very concise it has a program overview program objectives uh evaluation guidelines and then a review process so the changes the proposed changes are in two sections they are in the overview section and the program objective sections now we're going to talk about some of those changes I'll turn it to my colleague Aaron here to talk about the changes to the overview section thank you Matt um the proposed changes to the overview really reflect the work that has been done on sip State policy um so that when someone is interest who might a company that might be interested in a CP agreement understands what a CP can and can't do what the threat minimum thresholds are and um the basis by which we're governed in how we uh apply or work with a company that is interested in a sip agreement and making sure that they meet minimum requirements so that sip uh overview section reflects those changes that have happened since 2006 with the 2015 changes in the 2023 changes that we've negotiated so it's very clear that the minimum Investments are indexed that there are those expectations that are set the statute that this is about um a job creation tool in the traded sector um and all of that has just reflected of the state standards in that overview um and so all of that new information is included there it is not specific to what the threshold will be in like 2027 because we won't know that it'll it's dependent upon the Consumer Price Index that's what it's indexed to but that's clearly laid out in um in the overview that that's what it's indexed to so we'll be able to give more accurate numbers if someone were to come and propose a c agreement in 2027 we could see this is what the CPI would put that Threshold at now so those are the primary changes that were those are the changes that were made to the open it just reads a more modern version that Al wonderful thank you Erin with that I'll talk about some of the changes to the program objectives section where the balance of the rest of the changes uh lie um staff have uh worked uh following board feedback uh staff have worked to uh to modify the program objectives um and there's kind of two categories of changes uh and um so these these two categories of changes are clarifying and modernizing language we talk about some of this work differently we talk about Workforce Development instead of low-wage jobs to high wage jobs for example so that's that's one thing that we've looked to do uh and the other one is following discussions with your board and about board priorities and feedback we have sought to align the program objectives with the board's feedback and also with a one Washington County approach and of course one Washington county is the unifying effort to cross the county service lines that reenters on community and and the mission of the work that we do so I'll provide one example here and I have a slide that contains all of the changes a couple minutes we'll turn it back over to you chair to to lead the discussion here but just wanted to highlight one of the changes here which is changes to the second program objective so the initial program objective in the 2006 policy read provide job structures and support systems that will enable lower skilled residents to obtain entry-level jobs and move up and into higher paying jobs that's that's great stuff it's kind of a mouthful no no that's to our previous colleagues here um we've looked to again clarify and modernize some of that language uh listening to board discussions about board priorities uh to also change reflect um your your uh desired outcomes for this work so we have sought to change it too uh provide or support Workforce Development Services that increase access to meaningful job opportunities for community members that's that's one there we've also added uh you'll recall that there were nine program objectives in the 2006 policy uh we have are proposing to add another uh program objective this would be program objective number 10 uh and this program objective reads extend job in career advancement opportunities especially to groups that have been economically or marginalized and so this is about a reiteration of job creation and emphasize the need for Investments uh to everyone in the community uh and not just those that have an educational base um we can also look to past practices um that are in our previous um in our previous Sith agreements such as the Genentech agreement uh from from uh 2006 that talks about uh Community Support supporting education with the local Community Financial in-kind support for education education programs for students so that's a little bit of how things are operationalized uh so this slide this is a lot of text I do apologize I don't expect anyone to read the really",

absent commissioner absent commissioner Herer here commissioner roads here commissioner Slater is absent exced commissioner here commissioner TR here commissioner here we have are are there any interested here like to address the commission on specific agenda items under um deliberations or merits of land use issues reable by reviewable by the Planning Commission if there are such people would you please go to the mir's podium and stay tune in the address for record each person's comments will be limited to three minut move on to the consent calendar are there any corrections or comments other than consent calendar items uh would anyone like to make a motion for the approval of the consent I'll move to uh approve the consent calendar thank you second is there any discussion on the motion all in uh favor please signify saying I when Jenn call your name commissioner H hi commissioner Rose hi commissioner tyan hi commissioner TR commissioner I passes um we don't have any take her present or how you guess just for the record is here okay so I don't think I don't see any uh resolutions or action item so let's go ahead and continue to the public hearing first of all I'd like to ask uh the commissioners of anyone's have an expor day communication or any conflicts of interest to State them um I am currently working with a brand Consulting on another project thank you um Jennifer would you all right this is the second hearing of of case number uh case number cc- Z d01 Would you Jennifer would you please uh read the statement of criteria this is a public hearing to consider a minor comprehensive plan amendment in zone change case number CPC CC 241 for property located at 650 15th Street Southeast the criteria applicable to this application are found in sing Revised Code chapters 64 and 265 failure to raise an issue prior to the of the public hearing statements or evidence sufficient to award the Planning Commission and parties the opportunity to respond to the issue prudes appeal to the land for appeals on that issue as similar failure to raise constitutional issues relating to proposed conditions of approval procing actions for damages Circuit Court prior to the conclusion of the hearing any participant May request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony the Planning Commission will then either contend public I believe there was some Commissioners that were not physically present at the last public hearing and so I want to give them the opportunity to say if they watched the video and read all materials so that they could vote on tonight's decision uh commissioner rhods I did U watch the video and M all the sent um I did not watch the video but I have read the material I can abstain if that's um it's got do like half the so I think we have enough about you so we don't need you invite just to potential problem might be to like to call on the planner to begin pet planner 2 My Name City of Salem I'd like to enter into the record the supplemental staff report and this presentation as well as the additional DQ report submitted by the applicate which you have a copy of for the continued hearing for comprehensive plan map Amendment and some change case 24-1 just to recap that the Planning Commission hearing on February 27th the commissioner heard the request to make a minor comprehensive plan map Amendment and zone change for two properties located at 650 15th Street Southeast and address slot across on Lesley Street the properties were previously split zoned IC and IG and were changed to rm2 during the r update to the comp plan in 2022 since a constriction was discovered which prits the properties from being developed for residential uses or agricultural uses the current property owner did not develop them to the uses allowed in the AR Zone has applied to revert them back to ig zoning as the previous at the previous heing the Planning Commission raised concerns regarding the impacts of potential Industrial Development to the surrounding residentially zoned area shown in Orange um if the properties were changed back to ig zoning and planning commission discuss the need for potential mitigation measures for any future development to address the compatibility with the neighboring residentially Z properties set compell a list of permitted uses in the proposed IG Z properties to be restricted due to their more impactful nature such as heavy Manufacturing sales and services and waste related facilities all of these uses are prohibited under the current R2 zoning of the properties allow uses would still include some retail sales and services eating and printing establishments General construction and repair services as well as General wholesaling hous Distribution and storage uses almost all of which are not permitted in the current Tu other proposed mitigation measures included requiring any vehicle storage areas to be paved where the IG Zone normally does not require that uh any outdoor storage would be required to be screened by events or Landscaping from the abiding residentially zoned properties where the IG zone is not require screening for storage and any future development would need to meet a minimum 15% landsc Landscaping on site similar to the IC Zone one of the properties previously uh should be noted the property is currently vacant and has been for over a year as such it it has lost its nonconforming use status in the R2 Zone and any use on the property would require a minimum class one site plan review to established and use on the property and any future development would be red to current development standards of the zone and all other applicable standards of the UDC staff recommends the Planning Commission approve The Proposal with the conditions list and supplemental staff report that concludes my presentation any questions for thank you now I'd like the representative for the applicant to go forward and name thank you lindsy King with BR L from the representative for the property owner who robt I unfortunately was under the weather at the first here and so was I watched it online um but that course um thank you for this opportunity I just wanted to go over um some of the items that were brought to the planning commission's um attention and some questions that you had the last public hearing again this is the site uh with the two large stars there and just to clarify the property is not vacant it has been utilized as warehouse and storage uh since the property owner purchased it which was also the previous use um I was made aware of that by the property owner after the as stated there is a DQ restriction that does not allow for any residential or agricultural uses on the property this was uh brought to uh this kind of came about because the previous gu previous previous owner uh had a petroleum uh with diesel and Lead fuel storage tanks buried under the ground and they did some um work with DEQ DEQ did some testing on the site uh and essentially said the soils are so contaminated that it's unsuitable for residential use or for agricultural crop specifically crop in the DEQ supplemental information that I sent over to Peter this afternoon there is some information there with regards to how far the contamination goes down into the soil in some areas of the of the property sites it's down to at least 15 feet so in order to remediate that you would have to drag you dig up at least 15 ft of soils assuming that after that 15t they tested normal soil levels with no conment that goes all the way out to the creek so um that would probably not be a VI options considering it's an essential salary habitat and within regulatory floodway one of the uh items that the Planning Commission brought up was the flood plane and the floodway and you know the implications of any sort of site development on that I'm um back up uh so the city proposed conditions uh are within the uh restricting uses within the IG zone now there 75 roughly uses within that IG Zone the city's restricting 47 them 47 of them this includes the residential restrictions in DEQ uh deed restriction so 63% of the total uses in the IG Zone would not be allowed this leaves as Peter said retail office um things like daycare Etc City staff stated that the parcel wouldn't have been included in this our Salem update so why would we impose these harsh restrictions if this wasn't if this wouldn't have been added into the r salum of in the beginning had this deed restriction been noticed to add on to that in that supplemental information that I sent over there is a note in there from DEQ that in March of 2002 the City of Salem actually hired an environmental consultant for the site for a proposed school um they worked with Salem Kaiser schools so the city was aware of this cont these contaminants as early as 2002 um in that report it also states that it's unsuitable for things um that would allow people to excavate the dirt uh or the soil so like a daycare kids going outside playing in the dirt that's probably not something that anybody would want their children to play in and um any future development would require permitting which would mitigate some of those issues like the flood plane and floodway there are very strict uh floodway regulations it's almost impossible to build in the flood W unless you have an amazing engineer um and the right sight specifics I I personally am a certified FL play manager for FEMA so this is something that I'm extremely familiar with and I dealt with a lot when I was previously at the county um there as Peter said there um are zon to Zone setbacks and Landscaping buffers things like that also building and Fire safety so any building perits would have to go through to help make sure that these are um developed again the contamination of the soils um this involves at least 15 ft of excavation assuming that the soil stayed on site they don't necessarily recognize property line so this very well could have meandered onto the neighborhood properties there are a few errors so it's not in in this this issue better terms the property the previous property owner air in not alerting the city of the deed restrictions and the city air in changing the zone to a deed restrictive designation these are public record and it would it would maybe be um it um it would have been nice for the the city to say okay we're changing from an industrial property to a residential property let's see if there's anything that would cause problems city council has recognized that there is there is an error by reducing the application application fee by 50%",

        "text": " in a moment um for those of you who don't have the pleasure of uh having witnessed the legislative session um that the state of Oregon does they alternate between odd and even years of the length of session and the things that they have to accomplish 2023 being an odd year means it's what we call a long session which means that they have practically six months um approximately six months to um can you hear me sorry my computer says I'm muted but okay um they have six months to accomplish their business but there's only one thing they are required to accomplish in any given long session and that is to pass a biennial budget for the state um or the state of Oregon works on a two-year cycle for their budgets um for all of the um work that the state Administration has to accomplish and the policy goals of the legislature uh so in essence they have until June um to complete their work otherwise they need to extend and they have to take special notes so really all they need to do is walk out of the session with a budget but that's never what they limit themselves to um they also do a lot of policy work and in a long session they kind of have unlimited bills that they can introduce just time frames in which to introduce them and pass them at my account which was about done about half an hour ago there are 1929 bills that have been introduced for this legislative session and they are not done um I have not read them all because I have a limited capacity for all things um reading 900 1900 bills is well beyond my threshold but I have taken a look at the first 1800 to see what their subject matter is and I haven't dug as deep as I can into all of them but I have a general sense of what they're trying to accomplish in this legislative session but what Washington county is trying to accomplish really fits into five key priorities for the county um the first is making sure that we have um at the county level the workforce and resources to do the work that we need to do to meet Community goals um there are a lot of places where we have uh identified a need to enhance our Workforce and that's going to take investment and it's going to um you know not just investment in the county but investment in the Workforce Development programs that exist and really setting up our Workforce to be able to do the work that is required of them and have meaningful long-term family wage jobs as they come out of school and into the workforce for us this is very acute in the public health and Behavioral Health sectors but it is not limited to those departments within the county um one of the things that has been mentioned in the housing and land use spaces is the need for the capacity of the local level within our um planning counters and our building officials and building inspectors which is timely given that that's what one of the areas we're hiring for is we just really need that Workforce to have the opportunity to be trained to come and join our teams and we also need the resources in order to make sure that we can afford to hire them all um so that we can get the work done um with the because to meet the capacity needs that we have across the county so those are the top two priorities is number one Workforce and making sure we have the workforce available and then number two is making sure we have the resources to pay for the things that we're required to do by the state um the state as I mentioned 1900 bills there's some work in there for counties to accomplish and we need to make sure that that comes with the resources to get it done so we aren't sacrificing other things that the community has placed a value on and has demanded of our Board of Commissioners to accomplish um for the sake of the livability and the ability to thrive within our communities the third thing that we're looking at very specifically is related to Economic Development tools that we have in the County's toolbox particularly and this ties back to the resources that we have in a program called game share which is where we receive payments from the state related to some of the property tax abatements we have given out um they take some of the income taxes that they earn off the ex large number of jobs that those property tax abatements account for and give a piece of that back to the local governments who have abated their taxes um and so we're trying to extend that to make sure that the county has sufficient Resources with a foreseeable future or gets closer to having sufficient resources for the foreseeable future by offsetting those um abatements um this is all going to get tied into something I'm going to talk about a little bit later but the semiconductor work that you may have read about in the um that is a big Topic in this session the other two components of what Washington County has prioritized are related to some Capital infrastructure needs that we have one is the county courthouse which was um is over a century old for the the original portion and then over I think it's hitting 50 years for the supplemental section and still does not meet the size and capacity needs of the the county the size of Washington County because it was built back when we were in Agricultural and very small County we have not been able to expand it so we're asking for resources from the state from a program that they have that will fund the planning process for us to do an analysis of what we need a site selection all of those components over the next two years so that we could be poised to do a capital investment provided we can bring the resources to Bear to actually replace our Courthouse the other piece is finishing up the Gap financing for the center for addiction and triage and treatment also known as cat this is a facility that the county is putting together to deal with behavioral and addiction services within Washington County and it is going to be a facility that meets the gamut of needs from people who need to come in for acute counseling or um you know in-house programs where they can stay in the facility so across that spectrum of need we really need a robust facility and that Center for addiction and triage and treatment is something that the county has spent a lot and is putting a lot of resources behind we just need to close some of that financing so we make sure we can complete construction so those are the two big capital projects that are part of Washington County's agenda for the second that doesn't mean that's all we're going to work on because there's a lot of ideas out there and some of them just aren't ours just spearhead but ours to support and others are ours to fine tune and make sure actually function when it comes back to you guys to do work related to planning for instance and some of them are just ideas that we can't afford to take on or actually provide a disservice to members of our community and meeting our community needs so we run the gamut from you know fully spearheading ideas to fully opposing ideas and the legislative session so writ large I'm going to talk about kind of four areas where that overlap because when it comes to land use and planning that touches everything um but one of the big areas as I mentioned in the land use space is going to be the work that's being done to implement or try to implement recommendations related to the semiconductor task force the semiconductor task force was a group put together early last year by Senator Wyden uh former Governor Kate Brown and Maria Pope the CEO of PGE and they took a look get what it would take to enhance and support the semiconductor work that is done as a foundation of a bunch of advanced manufacturing across the state um basically trying to get Oregon poised to pull down a bunch of federal resources that are coming through what is called the chips act which is a federal investment program in the semiconductor and chips manufacturing Arena Oregon is at the heart of a lot of the research and development capacity that happens in that semiconductor industry and we want to be ready to pull in those federal dollars to make investments in in the state of Oregon to enhance our education programs do a lot of Workforce Development to get people not just into jobs but into living wage family jobs um without having to get a PhD um we're looking at a lot of components of that the land use component of that is kind of identifying the industrial lands that are available across the state and how to make them development ready and to see if there's a efficient to meet the needs of what the semiconductor folks feel is going to be put us in the best light when it comes to getting federal dollars pulled down to the state of Oregon the clumber station is still really nascent in that world my herd I was at a hearing early the reason why I'm still in Salem is because they have hearings until 6 30 at night because no one has anything better to do right now um and I was in the semiconductor joint joint committee listening in on their initial hearing and what I heard today was that that land use component and kind of the outline of what the task force things should be done is expected probably next week um so kind of baited breath on what that means which may have some land use impacts in Washington County Washington County being one of like the Hub of this industry not just with the obvious one of Intel but there is a lot of advanced manufacturing that part of that supply chain that does a lot of the research related to semiconductor work throughout Washington County so you know being close in and having that industry tightly together Washington county is the fourth being looked at and we need to see what those recommendations are before Weaver County really address those but that is something at the end of the day if something moves forward in Washington County out of that task force there will likely be work for planning and land is consideration within Washington County in addition to that land the land use writ large there's also a bunch of Concepts around planning at large um some of that goes to concerns that the development Community has raised about the speed of the process to get from I have a piece of property I'd like to develop all the way through final certificate of occupancy and that has some impacts on how our land use and transportation department fundamentally works and we have to make sure that it meets the needs of everyone and keeps the county financially secure but sees um we find those windows of opportunity",

        "text": " slide please all right and so for our operating uh energy centers we have three wind operating uh currently uh close to this project we have Wheat Ridge 1 Wheat Ridge 2 and assumed to be Wheat Ridge East all wind projects operating in the mo or Wheat Ridge one and two are operating Wheat Ridge East uh we'll move into construction uh later this year uh additionally we have something that's kind of unique for the ren able energies and that's a trifecta and that's also located um with the Wheat Ridge wind facilities we also have solar and energy storage in more County as well uh and we just kind of threw up some stats of kind of our investment in the community and in Oregon uh based on our capital and expenditure uh our taxes our landowner payments right they're all big numbers but the biggest thing we focus on is uh we like to be a part of the community sponsor local events uh such as Hepner Rodeo was probably my favorite of this year next slide please all right and here's just kind of a line item that brings in more detail of the uh Maps I showed earlier um and what I was kind of alluding to of the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility one and two and uh we Ridge renewable energy facility 3 that's all collocated in Morrow County and then we're now this project uh Wagon Trail we're looking to collocate with those other renewable projects all right so now kind of what we're here for the wagon trail solar project it's going to be up to 500 megaw of solar and Associated battery storage technology our site boundary is 7,450 Acres all located in Moro County um and we expect the solar array footprint to be approximately uh 3600 Acres within that total site boundary uh we're going to be connecting to the same bluid substation just north of Strawberry Lane um and we're going to be utilizing the Blu Ridge to more flat transmission line that already EX exist there'll be no additional infrastructure there um and then obviously a project besides going to have a large construction team as well kind of a a rough schedule that we wanted to put out for everybody so like Chase said earlier uh we're looking at getting the site certificate you know around summer of this year and from there we're going to be moving pretty quickly to uh commence construction uh Springtime of 2025 for phase one so that'll be about half of the capacity and then that construction will continue throughout the year and we'll start up Phase 2 Construction in 2026 and that should finish out uh the total development of the project um and we and we do have a deadline of the end of 2030 uh but we think we're well ahead of that schedule u based on the pace that we're now next slide all right so what is highlighted in purple is the actual site boundary um and then the black outline is a half mile buffer that is added that we use for our land use analysis um specifically you'll see that called out in exhibit K we go to the next slide thank you and then I just wanted to show how all of our projects in the area uh kind of overlay and play out to just kind of show the collocation of all the renewable infrastructure structure that we're building in Morrow County so the yellow is the boundary for wagon trail uh the purple that's kind of overlaid the yellow boundary with the blue dots that is the existing Wheat Ridge 1 and two wind facilities and then the corridor that's moving all the way to the east uh and then through the moro Umatilla County border uh that is what is currently permitted and has a site certificate as Wheat Ridge East uh and then just the caveat there is an amendment uh in uh the approval process that will expand that boundary which I have on the next slide if we could just go there um and so that moral County um matilla County um boundary and Peninsula still there but then to the south of that we've expanded the corridors for Wheat Ridge East more into Morrow County so um I just didn't want to confuse anybody of what's currently has a site certificate and then what is in the the routing process all right next slide please thank you uh and then just kind of to talk about a little bit of solar energy and renewable generation so a project this side could power up to 95,000 households and that'll be clean renewable solar energy uh it's going to create jobs both construction and operation and maintenance jobs for the project uh it's going to diversify income streams for land owners uh it being a solar and battery storage project that has minimal Visual and sound impacts uh there'll be no water either consumed or discharged for the operation of the facility and then it being a renewable solar site uh there's going to be no um negative discharge or emissions next slide please and then uh I also want to include some information on our battery energy storage system uh just because I I don't think this is talked about as much but it is kind of a a critical piece in the renewable portfolio right so uh whenever there's Surplus power generated with our solar arrays that'll get fed into a inverter which then changes uh that electricity into DC electricity charge our batteries and then that battery can be charged when it's sunny it's bright we're producing electricity and then that energy is then going to be released to the Grid at night time or maybe the solar array is not producing on cloudy or a dark day and really the biggest asset of that is it just kind of levels out the power output curve of the facility and here are seen uh some pictures of what a battery energy storage uh can container looks like so uh it's a self-contained pre-fabricated unit um that is approximately the size of a shipping container but everything is self-contained self-operating and then you'll leak them in series uh for your actual output but uh I think everybody in moral County knows what a solar panel looks like I I wasn't sure if everybody knew exactly what our battery containers looked next slide please all right and here's my contact info uh one caveat to this is uh I'm way better at getting to my emails so if you email me any question you have uh or if you want any additional resources or information about the project uh it's just easier for me to track respond with additional resources or information and then I can always give you a followup phone call if needed and the only thing I would add if you just go back one slide uh if you would is the bottom two are actually the adjacent facilities that are already built so there is already battery energy storage as you see in the bottom left uh hand corner as part of that uh wheat rdge renewable energy facilities the plural um the the three that are already all right thank you very much Ryan um David really appreciate it we're going to um now move into our Q&amp;A uh and comments section of this presentation uh for phone participants as well as webinar participants and those that are uh intending attending in person in Lexington um I think we'll first uh take comments if there are any or questions if there are any from individuals in the room um and I'll on Nancy or Veronica to to tell me if there are people I can't see as I'm sharing my screen um and then we'll once in room in Lexington attendees uh have commented we'll move into those participating via the webinar and then we'll move into those on the phone line uh last and on this slide I have uh instructions on how to participate via the webinar or via the phone and I'll keep this up through the Q&amp;A session okay so we'll just go around the room here and um I'll start with our guests here and see if they have any comments and we'll end with m I have a question because I have the solar panels behind our house and the battery storage is there any uh standards or regulations on distance from residents cuz they do have a drone sound so I'm just just wondering cuz he's going to have some behind his house so if they're going to be on in one spot yeah I can uh answer that question uh so a part of our exhibits I believe it's exhibit y there's a uh noise sound decel level analysis so once we choose a vendor um and all the components that go into the solar and energy storage site we we'll then do another noise analysis to determine what the deel levels are at all noise sensitive areas so that would be like a residence uh but short answer to your question is yes there is a standoff from residences is there a distance that has to be from a residence like when they set them up like a half a mile or something like that I'll I'll take that one there's not specifically a exact setback that far there's the normal County Etc but um it is the noise um or sorry the sound levels that that dictate um the next I think you had a second question in there and that is uh these will be located uh further to the West than the existing uh facility and they will be uh located in in a in a grouping and will be as Ryan said we'll be doing all that uh sound analysis um uh you know prior to construction and as a land owner um as you know we will be coming to to talk to you about those results okay and the the noise the noise standard actually um follows the Department of Environmental qualiity noise rules and that's uh that's what determines the thresholds and noise levels is deq's noise rules well um really didn't really realize the noise level until they're built and you're actually dealing with it the worst of it when it's cloud cover it is a drone that I hear all the time but you know I I signed off on it so I can't say much and you know around like how long it would be until those um decibel tests are performed is that going to be like in the next year is that going to be when the whole you know construction of this project is completed and if so can we do like something in the meantime like you know just on that Bess site you know maybe do a a decimal you know test and adjustment needed yeah I mean Ryan or I I can take that you do the analysis as per the the sighting rules pre preconstruction as as part of our pre-construction because as of right now as as Chase said the layout is preliminary and as we get into further design and we actually um start ordering equipment or start knowing what we",

        "text": "hi everyone my name is Ruchi sudhir and I'm associate director for strategic engagement at the Oregon Department of energy and with me today is my colleague Casey Radcliffe the Oregon renewable energy citing assessment project manager this presentation provides an overview of the Oregon renewable energy sighting assessment also known as orisa which was a multi-year grant focused fees and constraints around energy in continued renewable energy development is anticipated in the coming decades and developing these energy resources involves balancing issues related to military operations land use Economic Development natural and cultural resources and Community needs and interests among others through coordination and processes at all levels of government including Federal tribal state and local specifically a question that we continue to receive is you know we've heard there's a need for more renewable energy development in Oregon to meet the state's energy and climate change goals but how much renewable energy and where is it all going to go while this entire question is larger than the scope of our project it is a question that we're really interested in and our project does provide robust data and information to inform it the project deliverables are a new educational resources communities policy makers developers tribes and government agencies interested in renewable energy policies and potential projects by providing a common understanding through data-driven approaches and enhancing early coordination notification the erisa project was funded through the U.S Department of Defense and it closed in June of 2022 with continued maintenance of the mapping and reporting tool planned to our intergovernmental team including the department of land conservation and development and Oregon State University's Institute for natural resources along with our military partners and local Liaisons at the Oregon Military Department and the U.S together our team worked with State local Federal and tribal governments along with gaining input from industry subject matter experts technical advisors and stakeholders across the the project scope and setting is the state of Oregon including on land and some offshore with broad consideration on Renewable Energy Technologies like wind and solar as well as Associated transmission infrastructure the project approach was to collect a baseline or state of play for Oregon by collecting intersectional data information and perspectives the project was also aligned with other ongoing and complementary work on renewable energy and project citing which is distinct but did inform the project findings and considerations our goal in partnering with the dod is to support military compatibility through coordination and early an early notification and raising awareness about military needs and interests in Oregon I'll highlight a few key points our project deliverables are considered discussion support and Educational Tools the tool is completely voluntary to use it does not substitute for information submitted to Regulatory Agencies at counties or the state for permitting this tool includes mostly publicly available data and information about energy military land and natural resources when a developer submits information about our proposed project to be evaluated for a permitting decision that information typically needs to be much more detailed and a reset project resources can help in the earliest stage of renewable energy development but will not replace the most more substantive analysis that's done in Project citing and permitting supporting renewable energy compatibility through coordination and early notification has been a strong goal of the military but has also become a major theme for others like cultural resource staff at tribes and local governments reviewing renewable energy projects all of whom want more coordination across government industry and communities finally our project engagement and deliverables were heavily driven by stakeholder feedback in order to create a collection of information and a new Baseline about renewable energy in Oregon with that I'm going to pass it to my colleague Casey Radcliffe to give you more project details thanks your G so our poor research was conducted through a series of consultant-led Assessments and an agency-led citing procedures review on the left of this image describes the three assessments that provided deep dives into renewable energy military and development opportunities and these assessments closed in the fall of 2021. key findings and data from these documents will fold into both the tool and the final report deciding procedures review also documented and visualized citing regulations permitting and project review processes the assessments and the procedures review relied on the expertise of State local and tribal governments collected input from industry and Technical advisors along with cross-sector stakeholder and Community engagement for example the opportunities and constraints assessment reached up to 400 stakeholders received 80 survey responses and hosted six Regional webinars with more than 140 different they also collected 650 spatial data sets 570 of which were renewed and considered for the mapping and Reporting the project had two major deliverables shown on the right side of this image which are the final report and the mapping and reporting tool to finalize these products we released the near final drafts and a beta tool and requested reviews and Corrections from stakeholders and project participants we then provided a series of presentations to receive final input and provide information to encourage awareness and use of these deliverables presentations included state agency staff boards and commissions the state land board and Senate energy environment committee government to government tribal natural resource and cultural resource meetings along with presentations to local government renewable energy associations groups together the project included more than 800 stakeholder touch points through 101 conversations surveys sector and topic specific meetings along with key deliverable for the grant was the final arrested report which is complementary to the online tool the first section discusses the project activities and methodologies including best practices for data collection the second section includes key findings from the assessments and contacts for the reporting functionality provided in the online tool the next section highlights critical conversations perspectives and issues from stakeholders and project and in the conclusion and appendices we have all of the assessment reports the procedures review summary Outreach and process documents and Military information along with final feedback from the tool and an index of data if you're new to our project we highly encourage you to start with a review of the executive summary in the report for example one key takeaway is that our assessment found that there is enough renewable energy potential in the state to lead Oregon's energy and sign the gloves while also acknowledging that there are trade-offs related to the impacts and benefits with development that need to be evaluated through sustainable and responsible processes there are notable challenges to renew energy development associated with transmission infrastructure and the citing and permitting criteria that way both policy and legal priorities for more details please check out the full report which is posted on the arrested project website the mapping and reporting tool is housed on Oregon Explorer and is curated by Oregon State University libraries and our partner at The Institute of Natural the tool includes robust data and queries for military Energy natural resources and Community Information along with other important users are able to interact with and browse spatial data they can also create site-specific reports to support early notification information they can review additional information such as regulatory processes Maps assessments and other tools that are not always reflectively the spatial data or part of this project to develop refine and test the mapping and reporting tool the Arisa team led by OSU INR hosted a series of nine focus groups with more than 60 participants many one-on-one meetings with agencies and staff from the Oregon nine federally recognized tribes cross-sector user group meetings and one-on-one beta testing with a half dozen cross-sector during this internet process the team gathered additional input and suggestions from almost 100 participants which informed develop of the final tool and information summarized in the final report in this final tool there are more than 250 data layers and you can explore those in the tool with more than 75 of those data sets queried in the final site level report as of June 30th 2022 the final deliverables were posted with additional project resources provided for reference and will continue to be developed to support increased awareness and use of the report in this room this also includes a new landing page on Oregon explorer that talks broadly about renewable energy features key information on this project and we hope will continue to be a platform for additional resources and tools in the future you can find this site by going to the Oregon Explorer home page and then clicking the renewable energy link ing ahead we continue to plan to maintain the tool we would like to develop new use cases and receive feedback via our online comment portal and we'd like to consider future functionality enhancements with your feedback you can sign up for email updates and you'll be notified of any future project activities or changes in closing the objectives of the arrested project was to Baseline data information and perspectives to create a transparent consistent collection of trusted accurate information in a way that would minimize conflict and support to achieve these objectives our project team and Consultants engage in extensive research and stakeholder Outreach the end result is a thorough assessment of renewable energy in Oregon that centralizes and makes accessible a vast amount of information to inform future renewable energy project and policy discussion we invite you and others to visit our online tool and the report and continue to explore our project website of supplemental information thank you",

        "text": " system and other plans throughout the next year um as trying to expand sprabb's role of investigating those and providing guidance so I think this is something really important for us to keep looking um Julie we'll come back to this a little bit later tonight as well as we talk about this Grant application and just other sources of funding that we can tap into to help you especially if there's ways that we can show support so thank you so much Mark for bringing this up I think we all really want to see that happen and thank you Julie for providing that clarification hey um are there any other members of the public that were like that would like to add comment okay hearing none um let's move into our board items so the first one we have is uh nominating an electing officers so as folks know we we do this every January we have the chair and the vice chair role currently occupied by myself and Keith um we first usually start with the chair we'll need a nomination a second and then we can go through and do a roll call vote um if there is competition we can do it either a Voice vote or we can do it on a secret ballot via email bye has not been needed in the last couple years I'll note that I'm very interested in continuing on um just to put my name in there I feel like we've set up a lot of really great work with the retreat and I'd really love to be able to help you all see that through and continue on some of this but I'm open to anyone else would like to put their name in and Rick I see your name is up as well or your hand is up all right my hand is up yes and I I'd like to denominate Dylan for thank you anyone is there anyone else that would like to put their name in for the not for nomination but I just want to make a comment I re I in turn would support you as a chair for another year uh as well as Keith but I would encourage folks to think about uh these are the Young Folks that's going to be driving this organization in the future so I I I would ask you if it goes the way I think it will that you work this next year to help groom Keith so that he at some point he's ready to move on uh I'm sure you don't want to do it forever and we need a next person needs to be well seasoned and well-versed in this operation so uh I would support both you and him with the idea in mind that we need to plan for this the continued success of the organization I think that's an incredibly well stated Point Alan and my hope is that Keith uh so my I can only serve one more term by the bylaws and so hopefully Keith would be interested and willing to step in next year if there's no one else that's um if folks are comfortable are there others that would like to put their name in for vice chair or would everyone be comfortable doing it as a slate nomination if I'm hearing myself and Keith being re-nominated if there isn't competition I I think it would be appropriate for us to do one single roll call vote I would support our current slate all right we'll call that a second to um any further discussion before we move to a roll call vote okay so to retain the current state of myself as chair and Keith is vice chair um Keith you get going down the list here so you get the first vote hi Alan Alexander hi Woody Dukes hi Rick aye Al Holland aye John Lloyd um Joe and I could not hear you if you were saying I can see you're you're moving and it looks like I If you can give a thumbs up it sounds like your audio comes there we go now I can hear you perfect uh Debbie Miller hi and Dave friedenmaker hi thank you all and I vote I as well so I really appreciate the the continued encouragement and support and really excited for moving into this year ahead and us doing a lot of different projects in terms of research neighborhood engagement and everything else so thank you for allowing me to continue in this role and thank you Keith for doing such a good job as Vice chair and continuing to grow in your in your leadership here as well all right well Julie the floor is going to be yours again we'd love to hear a little bit more about the letters of support you've come to request okay great so um the grant applications that we are preparing to submit to the state is for the Oregon Community paths program it is a program that is um was developed and is administered by the Oregon Department of Transportation it largely focuses on uh path connections for transportation that are outside of largely outside of the public right-of-way and these are areas that are important to Transportation but are not eligible for the state gas tax the state highway fund by the Constitution or something like that anyway we can't use gas tax outside of the public right-of-way but often we are trying to make these path connections for transportation purpose so two years ago was the first round of this grant program and as I mentioned we did a submit an application for the Pringle Creek path construction at that time and while we scored highly our project cost was such that it didn't fit into the available funds last round they only had about six million dollars available Statewide this year they have about 36 million that they're going to be allocating Statewide of that amount 3 million is um earmarked to go to project refinement um grants and so that will be the second application I'll be talking about the first one is the Pringle Creek path and I believe well anybody that was on this committee before knows what this project is the bond measure did include uh half of the funding for this with the recognition that we are going to need to gather additional funds including from likely sources being the urban renewal district and then also potential Grant funds the urban renewal District this particular urban renewal district is the South Waterfront bourbon renewal area it is not doesn't bring in a whole lot of tax increment at this point and so to rely on it to build up the additional funds needed would take several years and so we're hoping to be able to go get some of these State well they're actually federal funds allocated through the state we are recommending applying for the maximum amount which is six million dollars and that will require a 10.27 percent match although we would actually also be over matching because the current cost estimate is over eight million dollars to construct the project with all of the elements as Mr wig mentioned there you know would be there can be opportunities for trying to you know maybe phase things maybe we don't include the bridge underneath uh over the creek that's underneath Commercial Street initially or maybe we do there are some elements of the project that are also not eligible for the grant funding including the anticipated Scenic overlooks and art components those are not considered by ODOT to be Transportation related I can share my screen I will show you the concept drawing that we developed two years ago see here sharing screens is always challenging let's see can you see my screen okay are you seeing a concept plan we are okay it's not clear to me what I'm sharing but so so anyway this is the sort of concept plan with Commercial Street here extending that path along the bank and then underneath the railroad bridge with protection provided and then continuing it into uh Riverfront Park here's another view showing the scenic over overlooks that are anticipated I also have some maps that show how this bridge would connect um to you know between the Civic Center and then all of these other uses Bush's Pastor Park the hospital Willamette the capital downtown connect them all to Riverfront Park and then also into West Salem Future Path connections that are planned both on the east and west sides of the and then the existing rather dated by existing path that goes out to rickreall and then down to Monmouth it's a state highway path okay I'm going to stop sharing because I don't like not being able to see you guys while I talk but so anyway that's the that's the first project would you like me to take questions now or move on to the second project um I think if you could just clarify I guess maybe a couple quick clarification questions would be good just while we're on that one of the big ones I was going to ask is you were talking about letters of support and so would you like are you do you have sample text or something to start from that you would like us to endorse today or would you hope that we would write a fresh letter for you and I took the liberty of drafting a letter of support that actually is almost the exact same letter of support that you guys wrote and signed two years ago I did add a little bit to it relating to the um uh passage of the bond measure that can provide some funding for leveraging but otherwise it's pretty much the same I you know didn't share it with you in advance my apologies um but it's really supporting the connectivity and all these other things so I wasn't actually going to share it directly but ask if if you guys would be willing to and give your chair authority to sign the letter on behalf of the board and based on his review wonderful that was going to be my suggestion was to try and recycle last time so that is great I know we've had three of us worked on it Keith I believe you wrote the bulk of the letter so great that answers my first question um does anyone else have questions about the plans or project proposed Keith yeah Julie thanks um just curious I I know the property uh the one acre property there that this path would run along along the creek is uh is for sale um would that have any impact uh with the sale of that have any impact or potentially be tied into helping fund and develop the the pathway or tie into the pathway in any sort of way our Real Property Services staff you know has we have easements for the path you know where it's actually going to be the property that's for sale is you know they built that wall you know right right and so that part that's up against uh Front Street and Commercial Street is what's for sale um unfortunately the construction of that wall and the progress that they made in the last two years has increased the cost of the project because it's basically access is going to be more challenging so we had to inflate the cost to address that um",

        "text": " let's let's let's talk about let's think about that and see how we can do that that's that's a good point um I think that was what I had the only other update the region one area Commission on Transportation is meeting April 3rd they're meeting in person in Clackamas County and I think you saw my talks Slide the um that that'll go sort of it'll follow on the same location that there's a public comment period on the step and then that'll be in person and um the the agenda is still being um they're trying to figure out how to put but the best topic is given that it's in Clackamas County um and then just one last thing and then what I would like to turn it to um see if there's any comments on the original Total advisory committee but the I-5 totaling project environmental assistance is up for public comment ODOT extended the timeline to review that for 45 days to 60 days comes to April 21st that's another question for you whether you thought you've heard enough about tolling it is precedent setting because it's the first environmental assessment um in the region more to come on that clearly uh and whether you think that's worth your time I just at least wanted you to know you can think about that at least want you to know that comments on that are due mid April there's still some requests to extend that further because you know that environmental assessments they're thick and deep so that's all I have um um I hope that we're open to any suggestions you have for meeting agenda of course always just let us know and then is there anyone either um mayor bubeneck or commissioner fi would you like to say anything about the original Total advisory committee and if I've left anybody out who was at the last region one area Commission on Transportation that wants to say anything please do I think you all had a update on the step kind of like today's I remember right so I'll go with uh mayor's Lube or Wenzel anything you wanna point out from the region one act meetings you've been attending I have nothing to point out or ADD I think I mean we lost mayor whistle back to her classroom all right uh commissioner fire you want to go first or me for our attack um because you're wearing two hats now I um a few folks don't know commissioner Phi is on the rtac and she's also on the Strack this track it's the rule making uh group that's associated with Towing so she's gonna wear both hats yeah then I think uh to simplify it I think I'm representing the the r tag on this track yeah I don't know if that simplifies or perhaps complicated but um yeah I don't I don't think there's um big updates uh in terms of this month's meeting for the r-tech um I think myself commissioner Savas and president Lynn Peterson and Chris meet to develop the agenda for the r-tech so we have that meeting scheduled at least for this month and to discuss what topics to put forward for the team so I'll know more after that meeting but but as of now we don't have the agenda for this month but at least we're I think I'll leave it for you mayor to talk about but at least we're on the uh we're we started the conversation to talk about the revenue so this month the rtac doesn't have a um because I think odot's pretty focused the EA and getting comments from the ea uh I just grafted a letter and signed it and sent it away to Mandy Putney of ODOT asking for the EA to stay open for 90 days rather than 60 days because you know we have our smaller staff here as Chris was saying the EA is pretty thick uh and you don't race through this thing from folks I've talked to who actually taking the time to read through it they are finding mistakes and emissions and errors that they want corrected so it's worth taking a look at um as commissioner five said we actually started talking revenue and cost at the last rtac meeting we finally agreed on the charter it's a very quiet agreement about your Charter for the rtac committee how you know our rules and we also uh quietly agreed on odot's initiative to try to speed up the process between uh IFI I-205 tolling Abernathy tolling and rmpp uh they want to get it down to a year and not longer than a year so they had some processes uh ideas how to make that happen quicker um the one thing that raised a few eyebrows for the Clackamas County cities uh was the information about the cost the tolling costs So based on some preliminary analysis every trip just overhead costs or ODOT that's like credit card fees Administration all the hardware required for the tolling is about 70 to 80 cents per trip um so right off the bat they have to cover that so they had a couple of models of uh the toll for the 205 being anywhere from a dollar to four dollars to six dollars and you know they can't have to arrive on a dollar amount where they can cover their cost but there is at least some net revenue and based on the preliminary analysis showed us was that pretty much the most the cheapest it could be of three and at three dollars that um you know that 80 cents takes up a big chunk of the uh toll and it doesn't leave a lot left over for net revenue uh so we're gonna be talking more about that in the future but they actually did give us some numbers for the first time since we started meeting so I look forward to meeting in April if I see uh Council service rosenthal's hand is up and then commissioner Phi well I I have a couple I thank you mayor I just have a couple things that I want to add at the end of the meeting but regarding that Metro will be submitting both a staff free a staff comments on the eea as well as a general policy statement on the EA which will come to council before the the end of the review period uh I may submit my own comments because I'm not in let's just say I'm not particularly happy with the EA and then but I'll save it for the end of the meeting there's two other minor items that I would like to just mention all right so I'll go back to crucify you put your hand down oh yeah I um I think you clarified it my meeting this month commissioner it's it's for the artec but in April I think you clarified it I I wanted to make sure that I don't stress in case Clackamas folks are listening in and thinking but the meeting this week is to plan for the April one year right a part of those Clackamas folks I'm in both counties right uh so yeah so uh even if uh 205 tolling isn't going to impact your city right away please look at the EA especially for transportation Wonka love this kind of stuff uh please take a look at it you go to odot's website where the crew systems right off the bat was the initial release of the eea and the website was only in English so the uh folks the rtac committee came back saying come on you got at least get this in Spanish and ideally some multiple other languages primary languages in the area so that if this is Equitable and all those people who can be impacted by the tolling they at least read these documents in their native language uh which ODOT said okay and I think that's what he tacked on at least 15 days I'm hoping for more all right so any other I'm going to go back to council Rosenthal if there's two thanks well first of all I just wanted to say a brief word that the uh the um TV Highway study is ongoing it is going to reach some critical areas there because there isn't a sufficient money in a small grants to fund a complete project for the entire length so some higher decisions are going to be made regarding whether additional funding can be made available or whether funding can be gotten from some other sources to deal with that uh there's two different segments of course there's the segment from Forest Grove to Hillsborough and the segment from Hillsboro down to Beaverton uh so there's there's a lot of hard decisions in in critical analysis they've done a lot of scenario analysis and it's pretty um anyway it's a one of the interesting things is that there's less ridership in in the route from Forest Grove into Hillsboro then in the other District but the ridership density is actually higher in other words per mile of bus routes so there's more people getting on per mile in the Cornelius and Forest Grove areas than there are in the Aloha area that's sort of an interesting um takeaway from all this so that's ongoing it's going to be continuing hopefully we have some decision of an LPA to later in the summer so if anybody has concerns I know what obviously the mayor's mayor Callaway and mayor uh you know in Beaverton and everybody else is pretty much keeping track of that and then one other thing which is not a big deal but it is a regional issue is that we're moving forward with the Dos which is the evaluation of what to do with the Expo Center and it it looks like now there's a lot of people that are getting behind the idea of of course keeping the Japanese internment section and making that into some sort of Memorial but also focusing the Expo Center on a Regional athletic event kind of Center as well as the kinds of things it's doing so if anybody has any comments on I mean it's a regional facility so if anybody has any comments my guess is you should contact either Metro or Steve falstick who is the manager of the Metro facilities and make some comments as to what your druthers might be because it's used by pretty much everybody in the region as far as I know mayor Cowley this better not be about the Hops new big Stadium no I was just going to say Willamette Week had a really good article about the Expo Center and um you know it's it's relatively quick and brief read and um so it's just a good good um way to build on what councilor Rosenthal just said about the Expo and the bigger Stadium for the Hawks I saw that article too I'm like what just for clarification you know we're committing about 15 and it's coming out of TLT so where it's all good all right are",

        "text": " tariff you know it's it's just i don't know it it seems obvious but it seemed obvious for for decades now and nothing much has happened the electric utilities started depending more and more on gas natural gas for there was a big effort uh underway to get the electric utilities to talk with the gas utilities about what that implied the electric utilities were worried about the security of the supply etc they had all kinds of worries as they always do now we have the ability of not just making electricity out of gas but making gas out of electricity completing a circle that's a very utility or grid paradigm and and i just you know i think the biggest barrier perhaps today is a lack of imagination frankly we're kind of going along thinking in the same way as we've always thought and it and we won't get there we just can't get to the targeted amounts of renewables and the decarbonization targets thinking in the same ways that we've thought so we we really need you know you need to think about storage as more a part of the transmission system you need to think of the loads as more of a support for the grid and and there just isn't that kind of systems thinking going on that i can that i can see if it if it is it's very thanks ken a comment from janine as well as a question here's that storage is a significant cost barrier so may need more analysis on likely cost and cost effective end uses and how to support those for speed time to market sounds like hydrogen for resource adequacy is not realistic given time frames maybe that needs more exploration and lastly is pac northwest exploring a hydrogen hub i guess pacific northwest as a region perhaps exploring a hydrogen hub to doe and how do we capitalize on learnings from that if so um we can start with the last one i know or um oregon is um in coordination with washington and our respective governor's offices on hydrogen hub applications and rebecca's actually helping with that too so i'm sure she could add more if she'd like but some of the other questions around um um storage and resource adequacy um some like good questions as well any thoughts absolutely absolutely and you know the the cost of compressing and storing and transporting hydrogen um those are all material costs and there are concerns with the longer term storage of hydrogen you know with um a process that's referred to as boil off where essentially you start to to lose some of the hydrogen um and so you know that raises questions of if if we in the northwest were to look at renewable hydrogen as a potential um energy storage uh medium what way would that work because we don't have the same kind of you know preponderance of geologic storage opportunities as other states uh you know you may have heard of the uh utah project aces um where you know they've got a huge um geological cavern and so they're planning on producing hydrogen and storing it in the cavern and they could store you know a ton um so if you know if we are thinking of long-duration storage for for hydrogen um in oregon that can mean a few different things um you know does that that we transform it into a carrier fuel that's easier to store like ammonia maybe of course then you're just adding yet another step that requires energy and that reduces efficiency so these are um big questions about it and certainly um i think the goal is is to co-locate uh production and consumption to the most practicable degree so that you know you aren't one having to store it for longer periods of time and certainly that you're not having to transport it farther distances and then yeah so ruchi also mentioned the the hubs work and and we at odo have been involved in conversations um with washington and with oregon uh stakeholders on that and so certainly uh that process has has really yielded some some great um insights that are transferable to the study in terms of what developers are me talking about and looking like looking at what pencils out right right now what doesn't you know what the project development landscape looks like in oregon things like that and then certainly if there were to be you know if if oregon and washington had a successful um and you know were awarded hub funding that could throw you know a lot of assumptions into in the study into overdrive um you know an infusion of 500 million or a billion dollars into the region into renewable hydrogen could really be transformative in terms you know helping helping with that chicken and egg issue getting production up and running helping um you know immediately getting potential off takers plugged in and just really kind of starting to build that ecosystem that we great thank you rebecca um i think my colleague jessica is going to add a link to the usdoe webpage on hydrogen hubs in case folks aren't familiar with that um with that opportunity michelle added a comment to summarize um recognize that there are loads that utilize the grid and those that can support the grid and arlene added it would be interested and it would be interesting and the insight gaining um from the collaboration with washington state um and i think that that might be something to that we're continuing to work on and we'll be able to share more um hopefully soon and then i see ken's hand hand raised linda could you help uh can be unmuted i just wanted to say a word about everyone knows that storing hydrogen is expensive and everyone knows that the cheapest form of storage is in underground formations that are mined and hollowed the first one hydrogen is expensive to store is true depending what you're comparing it to it's expensive compared to storing water it's expensive compared to storing it's expensive compared to storing ammonia which is why there's a lot of ammonia talk um but it's between 10 and 20 percent the cost of storing it in pumped hydro or batteries even if it's not stored in salt caverns in other words buy a big iron tank fill it with hydrogen uh the cost on a per kilowatt hour of stored energy it's a little bit apples to oranges because i'm not including the cost of the generator and the and the but at scale once you do that you'll come to the same conclusion that it's 10 to 20 percent of the cost of storing uh in batteries or pumped hydro and lasts a lot longer so i just want to say that because we know that storing hydrogen costs a lot and i want people to modify their view a little bit it's not doesn't cost a lot compared to storing electricity as electricity you know in a battery or on hydro thank you ken that's um thank you for mentioning that not seeing any other hand raises um or comments or questions in the chat um one thing that i maybe might kind of push folks to think about is the second bullet here where um rebecca covered those blocks with you the semiconductor industry and a few others and noted that there had been some um difficulty in sort of gathering that data and wanting to sort of understand um there might be in terms of concerns if estimating that data if those data requests aren't fruitful so i wanted to sort of push the attendees to help us think about your thoughts there in terms of potential hydrogen consumers that we could we could work on trying to reach out to or or if you have um um some some help that you could provide in making those connections we would welcome that and then you know if if the inventory doesn't produce the type of level of information like rebecca covered in the slides you know what your thoughts are in estimating that data instead so just think about that one a little bit more i haven't heard too much about that one in the chat quite yet and then jessica did share that link to the hydrogen hub um and ken shared a link around storage tanks um for green hydrogen from ebergerola and a pause to see if there are any more hand raises or comments or questions in the chat keeping this one to be a slightly longer awkward silence to let you think about your ideas here and i just want to remind everyone that um the recording of this presentation will be posted online later today um the presentation itself should already be online um and there you do have the opportunity to conjutate on this a little bit and then to respond with comments later as well yeah that's right we don't need to stay on if um people want to drop off and provide written comments but this discussion has been really helpful for you all to hear each other as well so if you do have ideas or questions or other other comments we'd love to hear them now otherwise we can move on to sort of next not seeing any hands raised uh linda are you seeing anything no i'm not not this time there is another question here from about hydrogen fueling infrastructure um on interstate corridors um and so yes so odot um has been doing some really great analysis in this area last year they had their transportation infrastructure needs assessments or tina and that really focused on ev charging but then they published earlier this year their hydrogen pathway study which built on some of those assumptions and analysis and then extrapolated that to hydrogen and so um they do um they do uh make a difference uh in the study between you know infrastructure that would be needed for you know urban areas um as opposed to you know travel corridors um and so for the medium and heavy duty you know that so that would include that for for those trucks and then um you know and jessica or or jillian um you can jump in here too but my understanding is that um the west coast electric highway is also looking at opportunities for adding hydrogen fueling infrastructure and so there is some discussion there just in general about um you know what funding um is applicable uh right now for for hydrogen fueling um that's great the um chandran responded with that's a very high value use of hydrogen and um michelle had a process question which i'll get to in a second and ken had another comment around the tacoma tariff that was the first effort somewhat experimental not necessarily rigorously determined to be based off their cost but to have a high probability of recovering their costs he believes there has been a lot of interest in that tariff and those three entities have at least explored it with um tacoma uh thanks thanks for that additional information ken um and then michelle had a question about the written comments after this workshop are they to be primarily based on the questions that you see on the screen rebecca",

        "text": "energy or odo today we will be discussing the the oregon global warming commission's road map to 2013 and it's worked to adopt recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in today i'll be kicking off the meeting with support from our assistant director for planning and innovation alan slanka and linda ross for our meeting today we have a few key hey maya can i get you to maybe turn your video off we're having trouble with your audio and see if that works is that better we'll see thanks for letting me know sorry about that everybody um so for our meeting today our key goal not better is that not better it's not yet why don't i go over the agenda maya and do you want to leave and come back great thanks so what maya would have said is that today's meeting agenda is that we're going to go over some administrative information about how the meeting will run and what's going on overall with the plans here and then we'll also go into the roadmap to 2035 or what we affectionately call it the department of the tigger project that'll include a project overview consultant scope of work because we've hired out expert consultants to work on and then modeling and the timeline and then we'll get into a discussion when we want to hear from all of you that are on the line and thank you so much for joining us a discussion of the draft list of new actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so i don't know if maya is back i think it's her shared screen so i didn't really think about that part so alan i think you were up next right yeah you want to go through the facilitated meeting part and oh sure i just can't i can't advance the slides oh there we go somebody has the slides sorry i didn't know that them uh sure so um as far as how this meeting will be we have panelists that are odo staff and then ssg our consultant are also honest panelists and then most of our attendees are on as participants they'll be time reserved at the second half of the meeting for discussion but you can send questions through the chat throughout the meeting and i'll be the one who's monitoring the chat making sure either we get back to you in the chat or i'll be kind of keeping tabs and bringing things back up at the appropriate time if that's a better way to handle the particular chat so just know we're listening to that chat and monitoring it we also at the department um grab some community agreements from a recent equity conference that was held for state employees and we will um and so we just thought it would be we actually really liked them and we've been using them to kind of frame up meetings that we're having afterwards i hope that you agree with them um these are all designed to foster inclusive and inclusive and respectful meetings today and that includes being present being respectful remembering that we're here to learn and here as well to share perspectives both and then being flexible and patient around any technology needs or changes like the star of our show not having audio that's functioning right now so we're working on fixing that behind the scenes including having somebody else take over the slides this slide deck um to project that so uh hang tight you might we might lose the slide deck and get it back in a second so thank you for your patience with this we all got on and tested and everything was smooth but you never know so if you do have any questions if you go into the chat you can chat linda ross and linda is our person who can help with any technical needs throughout and then do you want to go to the next slide and then after maybe some hopefully somebody is working to to grab this slide deck and share it so maya can leave and come back okay maya's gonna go now um and hopefully we have a slide deck and if we don't we'll all survive for a few minutes while we get one back i know where it is and i can pull it up if people want to give me just a second but she'll also be back on in just a second too so we were getting ready to talk we have like a slide that kind of shows where things are in teams or in in webex and i'll just go ahead and describe that for folks um so there's a few ways to raise hands when the time comes um down in the bottom of your screen you'll see a little smiley face with a little plus sign kind of like in the near the red exit button and you can click on that to raise your hand if you want to be called on at any point during the conversation you can also raise your hand if you see your name under the participants next to your name there's a way to raise your hand but i think that little emoji is more fun so that's a good thing to use um if we once you raise your hand the way that these conversations work is we can take you off of mute and once we take you off of me then you can participate in the conversation freely your mute button is down also in that bottom bottom bar as well as the way to stop or have your video on if you'd like and then you'll also see in the bottom corner of your screen there's a chat there's like a little field with a little um comment bubble or thought bubble that says chat next to it if you pull that up you can open up the chat and follow the chat throughout the conversation or add your own chats and when you're in there you can also um you can also we've already got a long comment here that i'll take a look at later um but you can also pick that person so again you can either chat to everyone or you can go ahead and chat to just me if you'd like or chat to linda if you have a technical concern um and we'll be monitoring those chats actively so hopefully that gets us at least through the how webex works we can't if anybody has any questions about webex go ahead and add them into the chat um or feel free to raise your hand and i'll take a look to see if anybody has any questions okay great i don't see any questions or hands raised and i'll keep tabs if there are any questions about how webex works um maya we're glad you're back um we just kind of finished going over webex and how to raise your hand and stuff like that um and then fantastic yeah and so let's see if we can have you cover meeting logistics and see how things are going great thank you everybody for your patience and practicing resilience with us this morning um so hopefully you can hear me okay and and thank you for letting me know if that is not the case so um christy may have already covered some of these elements but uh just another reminder that we'll be recording today's meeting and we'll make it available on the oregon global warming's website and that link to which christy will be dropping in the chat if she has not done so already and if you scroll down to the bottom of that webpage under the section called resources you can find the draft list of actions that we will be discussing today so second we're asking that everyone please introduce yourself in the chat with your name your organization and a sentence about why you're interested in this work um and you may also use the chat to ask questions while we're presenting material again apologies if you've just heard this but we want to make sure that you can ask questions and then we can address if they are you know relevant to the particular slide we'll do it in a moment and any any other questions that can be held for the discussion we just ask that you note the slide number to help us facilitate that if you'd like to go back we've set aside the final 40 minutes of the meeting for discussion when we get to that time chrissy will remind us of any questions that were asked in the chat earlier on ssg will be facilitating that part of the discussion as well wonderful so we can go ahead and skip this slide i believe and i will pass it over to allen for a few words all right thank you maya thank you christy for stepping in um thank you all for joining us today good group so far and uh and and for your participation in this meeting um what this slide shows is our new mission and what we do your participation will directly contribute to our mission to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system as our mission says the tigger project will help us advance a set of climate actions that will will make up the oracle global warming commission's roadmap to 2035 and that in turn help helps us fulfill the rest of our mission as well next slide please so what is the roadmap to 2035 next ultimately what we want to create is a plan with recommended actions across all sectors of the economy that help oregon achieve its climate goals for consideration by the governor the legislature and other policy makers so how do we do that if you think of the current level of greenhouse gas emissions oregon will emit without any policies programs or actions it's a relatively flat line maybe a little bit declining that's our business as usual case that top line on the graphic to the right then there are all the new policies programs and actions that the state is already taking or is underway of putting together that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions projects are policies like the climate protection program from deq that will limit emissions from large stationary sources transportation fuels and natural the expansion of the clean fuels program which will uh decrease carbon intensity and and uh increased and from our current goal of 10 in 2025 to 25 in 2035 and hb 2021 that will dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from retail electricity that will result in a 90 reduction in emissions below the baseline by 2035 the end of our plan and 100 below the baseline emissions by 2040. so we call that our business as planned line and it lowers our line significantly and it's the yellow portion of the graph on the on the right and that line is the business as usual line but it doesn't quite get us to our target line for our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal that's the bottom line on the graph labeled decarbonization pathway the tigger project is the work to figure out what further actions we need to take to fill that gap between the businesses plan and the and the decarbonization pathways line that's the",

        "text": " the pink which is a little hard to tell on this map but the pink is the earthquake overlay Hazard it's not the only Hazard case he went through all the hazards that face our eny systems but uh most significantly in this region and to the West uh we often plan towards the cascad abduction Zone 9.0 earthqu scenario so we're looking at that as probably our worst case natural Hazard but I do recognize that fire other scenar other hazards are very prevalent um prevalent and important to consider too this just shows that so you can overlay the hazard mapping with Fuel locations and again where the people are where the fuel are and the great state of Oregon where there's a big risk for side that's just sort of how side um storage disruption 91 we know these things uh this lists the um uh number the amount of gasoline in the valley that's outside of that highest risk area so towards the east that if into the Foothills um you can see there is still considerable storage in the region that's outside of the worst Zone I think so the state I should step back and the data is from uh the pink is is it very high and high risk is that so they categor the state is categorized by risk of seismic shaking we used information from uh our sister state agency called dami Department of geology and mineral Industries which Maps these risks across the state and they have you know very high high medium low really low something like that they have a scap for risk from earthquake and these are the high and very high risk in to pin we haven't shown other risk now you know if there's 9.0 earthquake you will feel it you know you go up McKenzie river valley you're going to feel that shape but the estimates is it's not going to be as catastrophic as you know out in new as an example so there you go so that's useful a useful information for us to know where those facilities are located in this region or outside the worst risk zone for seismic shaking now we also recognize that you're outside of the worst risk in the line of Valley might be in the worst risk for fire hazard because you're on the foothill Cascades and like you know quite quite liberated fires came back through that region I understand understand that so it's not perfect but you know for our assessment modeling purposes for consideration visual this is important information and this is a zoomed in map towards um just the value region L value region and that same high chart again uh triangle is the fuel terminal in Eugene i i w believe the point but people may maybe don't realize this uh that fuel in the region comes into Portland primary comes into Portland via a major pipeline and then there's a pipeline that goes from the port of Portland fuel terminals right to Eugene uh fuel terminal from there it's trucked out across uh this and you know here in Salem we're probably getting a lot of fuel that does come by truck directly from PTO Portland but further south in Eugene and in the southern part of the State uh it goes out by a truck from the Eugene terminal um so there you go sort of fuel how it flows across the state and then here we got a couple things here I mentioned this ear if you if you are in this room on the call and you have have fuel operated let us know let's talk um the last point is really for County Emergency managers uh an fpod a fuel point distribution is is something that means something for people in Emergency Management response it really just means uh in an emergency where should fuel counties and state designate locations where fuel should go for emergency response purposes they're called fuel points of distribution um and just a point for the EM emergency managers listening uh we can talk about collocating a fuel pod with a resilient tank doesn't have to be that way but it should Mak sense to consider those um sort of synergies if you will okay so any questions on the fuel piece right now and if not I'm going to pass Casey and we kind of dive into some of the things yes sir you stayed away from resupply as a as a topic so you focus very much on the inran storage and all the other aspects but you mentioned ver the mutual pipelines but we see very much information about that and also um there's just blue lines showing resupply coming in on a river that maybe compromises through major earthqu certainly the do structures so there's no alterate show Supply see yeah so I I was for it's a good question uh and you mean like rewi fuel how fuel gets into these regions is that what you're thinking um we have that information we didn't present everything uh on this screen talk gu yeah so what we're looking at is a 9.0 cascus reduction earthquake um we understand the river will be non-navigable for sometime based on tsunami debr and or bridges falling into River we see that in Baltimore how long it takes to restore that um the pipelines are likely going to be down from damage um even if they're not Dage they'll be shut down as a caution before they can be reinspected open up again um what we're looking at with this increased storage is um if there's communities are that are um stuck if bridges are down and you have an island of people left after the the earthquake that is hard to get services to we want them to have fuel to sustain themselves while people from the blue dots work their in and reconnect those bridges and and reduce islands maybe I'll just add that just as a uh this isn't intended to be an emergency response plan necessarily but we do have we do have emergency response plans for fuel I don't know to mentioned this the beginning but part of our agency's responsibility is emergency response for petroleum FS uh in the words of Emergency Response it's emergency support function energy 12 they get a number to it and then number to 12 and that's for fuel particularly so we have um other reports and plans in place that do specifically talk about post disaster fuel distribution channels and I haven't we haven't published that here um but that is something we we do have and I be glad to talk about it um at a later date if you're interested in that but thank you for bringing it up and one last thing the um Federal Emergency Management agency FEA um estimates that they can have fuel deliveries to the state about 72 hours after the caspia abductions on earthquake um so really what we're and it's not going to be a lot but it's going to be something so what we're looking at is trying to make sure that the responders in these areas can have fuel on day zero day one um while we're waiting for federal support to come and that Federal support assumes access another good point right so there's also sometimes a disadvantage of sharing too much information for the very Reon comis security so I understand there's totally a need to know Basics here but that said um how far are you going to go with this because here's a plan but then the other boot would say well are you identifying things that maybe could be improved are you getting I things need to change so we're going to come up with um a of where additional fuel storage be beneficial so um we know or Department of Transportation has key bridges that they want to make sure are hardened or are first in this to get rebuilt after so we want the fuel be close to those you know that type of metric um in addition to having a large flat paved area so trucks can come in and out and you can do Supply staging there too so there's a number of criteria um there's no funding associated with this project um associated with increasing fuel storage yet so we're just doing a broad brush recommendation of these are the things you should look for and if you happen to have fuel storage and you want to increase in that area um and you meet our metrics then you're going to be on the short list for if funding does just one general question online what makes it tank resilient um the ability to withstand s shaking and still provide service and that would be it's mostly an engineering consideration um foundation design where it's actually located uh and if that ground that it's on uh is as an example of a Port Port A lot of those tanks are on what's considered liquefiable soil which means in a big earthquake they kind of turn to liquid um we don't want that so this geologic uh immediate geology of a tank pad uh as well as the engineering of a tank itself and generally speaking uh the codes for tank construction changed I think in the mid to late 90s so any tank built before that is unless it's been retrofit is most likely not res and you like tanks don't get built very frequently and so a lot of Oregon's tank infrastructure dates from 50s and 60s before the seismic risk was really understood so um this effort is on it's not a Star Agency I should say Oregon DEQ as I mentioned and private Partners recognize there's some work to be done do we can is there a question no okay pass thank you okay thanks okay so this is going to be our first time to for you guys to give us feedback via slid out so uh we're going to be walking through the questions in slido one section at a time so please don't feel like you have to go in and answer everything right now we're literally looking at one question we just want to know if you're interested in engaging with Odo to increase um fuel storage Capac capity so if you do if you do have interest in this please let us know so that oo knows to follow up with you you will have already given us your name and email so we have a way to do so um this for reference or your information the slider will be open through the end of the month and so we're going to take some time and we'll pause give you an opportunity to answer questions as we move along if at any point you're not able to finish answering it you can always come back to slido later on to finish things up um and of course it'll be open after after this meeting as well so you can wrap things up um even beyond our official end time for the meeting so as I've been talking I'm assuming you'all been able to answer yes or no so we'll go ahead and move on to our next series of sections where we're going to have a rhythm to our um correspondents here and so",

        "text": " Commissioners you got commissioner Rogers are you thumbs up I don't know enough about it to be thumbed up or down but if Aaron says we should be there must be all right thank you commission for that faith and trust I do think that there's an opportunity here to find more resources to come in for um both throughout what counties have to do in order to make sure that um our court houses that we we run for the state are sufficient with that I'll turn to our final slide related to my portfolio and it will talk even faster if that's um so the next big conversation related to funding is going to be around the interstate Bridge replacement funds we expect that um maybe next week or the week after that they will have uh informational and then public hearings around how they plan to pay for the um ibr or the I-5 Bridge replacement whatever you want to call it today what has been spoken about publicly is that they are not looking to find new Revenue but instead bonding around all of the current revenues that they have available to them between ODOT um bondable Revenue as well as Lottery um it reach that 1 billion threshold that the state of Oregon needs to come up with our portion that is outside of the polling that is planned for the that Greg that polling Authority is in place already um within Oregon and those dollars don't get to be apportioned to one State or the other it's um part of the greater mix of funding that it takes to do the ivr replacement which includes Federal polling Washington and Oregon Monies to come to the table that conversation has to happen relatively quickly as we are running into a the uh need to be ready to be ready for federal funding so I'm going to praise um so that will probably happen relatively quickly it is the next big paycheck that has to go over a mighty number of thresholds and is in the joint Transportation committee if you want to move that forward at this point in time um that is then being pitted against the ODOT funding for a local government bills that we have been talking about um up this week for consideration and I will be testifying in favor of its House Bill 31 13 which is the great Street program great streets is basically where we take among other things uh orphan highways as they sometimes been called but basically county or city roads are sorry State Road that service City roads bring them up to standard um so that they are functional and can meet those needs so it's a pot of funding that ODOT can use to pay for those things um a lot of folks are focused on the jurisdictional transfer process with those funds but there are so many Urban artilleries yeah Urban materials but need sufficient funding to be um to really truly serve those needs with all types of Transportation um safely accountable um in the right-of-way and on the Main um so we're hopeful that that bucket of money will be bigger not smaller um similarly the state fund exchange House Bill 2101 which is looking at the 50 or taking any federal abortions the local governments get I mean basically sell it to ODOT to use their Federal programs to that we can get less tethered money but at a slightly reduced dollar value that conversation is still ongoing and as ODOT looked at what they have to bond against for purposes of the interstate Bridge Project those dollars become fewer and fair and so we are at the point working to protect our resources so right-of-way permitting that's uh Bill we don't think it's going to move um forward but we have commitments in the legislature legislate towards to really look at this but essentially right now right now the county can't can run a permitting program within the rights of um but we cannot charge for those permits um so this comes up with utilities primarily when they do work in a right way we need to make sure that they are doing them in a safe manner that also then replaces the infrastructure Investments we have in our right-of-way back to the standard that we aren't liable for any damages related to users of the right-of-way um that conversation has been 10 years in in the making and we are really trying to balance the needs of the county to cover the costs to do the work related to permitting not just review of the permit but making sure that our right-of-way are returned to our um so all of that is uh to say that we're hopeful that in the interim we will come out of that process with a clear Authority from the legislature in 2024 to actually start targeting for those permits um for you to lead and then the final thing I'll say is that polling has been a much talked about but not publicly heard issue this legislative session there was an expectation that they would be opening the polling statutes related to the interstate Bridge replacement but due to the timing of many things that is unlikely to happen this session um there is now conversation about whether or not there will be a public conversation related to any of the polling bills there's about six or seven of them out there right now that do various levels of datas to the trolling statute from completely revoking the ability to do any tolling on I-5 and I-205 to revoking tooling across the state except for on the Columbia Bridge or the Columbia crossings that currently exists who report to requirements for consultation with local governments and with that I see commissioner Rogers you have your hand about could you reconcile your comment on the interstate Bridge replacement funding you said that they really weren't looking for any more Revenue they now we're talking about tolling it so I I I I didn't know something you were trying but the polling on ibr is already in place so it's not considered new Revenue so what I meant by new Revenue was looking to put an increase on the gas tax or a vehicle miles travel tax or some other means by which they would create new Revenue to the state outside of polling any other questions related to Transportation nope sweet then I'm going to stop talking and I'll pass it over to soccer thank you thank you Aaron for the record soccercon government relations manager here at Washington County next slide please all right got a couple of different areas to go over today um but the first thing is to give you some good news on these bills uh House Bill 2651 and 2977 were approved by the house Behavioral Health and Health Care committee uh both had bipartisan support the first bill House Bill 2651 passed on you on a unanimous vote um so that bill would provide 75 million dollars in funding for the Oregon Health um with a specific uh earmark to counties towards helping recruit and retain behavioral health workers through a variety of different incentive tools and then the bill would also provide funding for clinical supervision which would thus take boost take home pay um on Hospital 2977 this bill passed on a 9-1 vote and committee group members were really grateful for the wide skill of entities that were included including all of the universities and colleges who would be assisted in providing scholarships for their students so heavily allotted bills in the committee yesterday and a lot of really happy people surrounding are efforts in this in addition to that we have found a chief Champion for the center for addiction triage and treatment which is Senator Campos so if you see her out in the community we've started to thank her for being willing to to fight for Washington County um on to the next issue here which is House Bill 2513 so this is a part of we've been a part of a work group every Thursday morning for measure 110 implementation and so what this bill has done now because because it's been amended is that it's largely being responsive to the Secretary of State's audit of the measure 110 implementation and so there's been a series of solutions that have included improved staff support for the oversight and accountability Council which just oversees the disbursement of funds and improved aoha support um I ever made the kind of position on this has remained neutral because there's some important Equity language that has not been included in the bill yet and so one of the things that I had asked Sharon knows to do was to include language that would track the number of bilingual and multilingual providers that are increasing as a result of measure 110 Investments because we don't want marginalized community members to be left behind in this process and with the county is as diverse as ours as diverse and in linguistics or language we want to ensure that everyone has equal access to services so we're continuing to work with sharing notes on this issue and we will see what what this ultimately results in um and then um wait wait yes sure Brad does that jeopardize any of the work that you've been doing with major 110 yes I don't think so okay just wanted to check yeah thank you sure absolutely uh thank you thank you chair for that point um on to Senate Bill 953 the medical examiner's office um so I want to just kind of provide a bit of background here because I think I need to contextualize how this bill is currently existing so back in February we were sent a memo from the Oregon State Police that cited rapid population growth increasing homicide rates covid um and a Confluence of other items that led to a significant increase in the workload for the State medical examiner's office um they did a workload analysis and determined that they didn't have enough staff and the staff that they had were planning on leaving because of the significant amount of workload um so the the probable steps included um articuling that one they all they serve as the County Medical Examiner for 14 of Oregon's 36 counties including several of Oregon's most populous counties and that service would be con discontinued effective July 1st um and what this memo indicated to us is that there were significant physical impacts that the county would potentially face when they were to shut off that service essentially so what changed since that memo came out number one sorry I'm just doing a bit of allergies today there's the Senate Bill 953 came out and this created some statutory changes um that would allow for physician assistance and nurse practitioners uh who may be appointed as medical examiners defining the scope of practice for the medical examiners articulating supervision and training for for those physician assistants and nurses but doesn't really Define those terms and allow the state chief medical examiner to retain approval authority over a County employee so there are several problematic",

        "text": " strengthen the project uh could have some opportunities for those added scoring uh program benefits and priorities that we've uh that we spoke about earlier clay do you have anything you want to add there I think you nailed that um the we had several applications in round one that were similar to that campus or compound situations and they were looking at multiple buildings and for planning they wanted that engagement to talk about that with their students or with their residents in the community and so that's a that's a great aspect of the community involvement Community engagement and not required in a planning Grant to have that specific you know rooftop already identified that's so great to hear thank you and I was just curious about um if that also applies to the Consulting fees in terms of eligible costs to have consultant support for small jurisdictions that may not have a lot of staff to be able to have the support that stakeholder engagement as an eligible cost not just for Consultants to do a solar analysis or something like that in in that one it would be I would probably want to get a little bit more specific detail from you just to make sure that we're completely understanding what you mean by consultants and the work that they're doing uh there are going to be in that type of work there's going to be some costs that could wind up having some eligibility there are some costs that that might not so I think this might be one of those great opportunities to go into the form and ask clay and I maybe a little bit more specific of what the con of what the Consultants would be doing as a part of the project we might be able to help answer that one a little bit better and in addition you can also go back into the administrative rules and just look at those for that particular type of project look at the eligibility or the eligible first the non-eligible costs okay that's how I I see other people are asking about that too for for small organizations that don't have a lot of um and I will definitely follow up with you uh my I guess I just have one last question in terms of defining how what what is your threshold for considered a small scale um application or small scale renewable it's similar to the question that was asked earlier about the dollar figure of a particular project um the you know the program outlines a project size at a maximum there is no outline of a project size down at a minimum and Clay do you have any more you want to add there no no minimum style we had one application that had some uh parking lot solar for nine spots you know they wanted to do net metered solar um above nine parking spots and that's a a great use and and the net metering would reduce the costs of that City so there was benefit to the city and the community just simply through um you know savings and pollution reduction through through net metered perfect those are great examples I appreciate it great okay so the next question is about uh eligibility uh would an organ housing authority agency be considered a special government body to the best to the best of my knowledge uh yes they would um and excuse me uh the Housing Authority would be a special body uh you can confirm that I don't have these specific uh statute up in front of me but uh within our program documentation you'll find a link that goes back to all of the specifically listed uh special bodies so not just Housing Authority but if you're not if you're not quite sure if you qualify you can go in to that statute and and pretty much find the specificity you need to determine if you are and if you're still not sure use that form and uh and send a question in for us and we'll get that information back to you great okay next question here is similar uh to what we previously heard about uh small organizations not having staff and funding resources needed to develop a competitive application for the planning Grant without funding to contract planning design assistance renewable energy projects will never happen in our community this seems completely misaligned with your stated Equity goals while future rounds of funding address this major problem uh the you know the program uh the program came through HB 2021 we've always appreciate concerns and feedback um you know from applicants that are moving through that project but as uh you know as the the program team um you know we at this time we run the program as the legislature put it into play I don't know if how I'd be able to answer it any different than that but I definitely do appreciate it yeah one thing I'd like to add to that is um don't uh I don't I I give it a shot on the application because the planning applications even though it's asking for a lot of detail there's a lot of room to to put in estimated or desired your vision around what your project is without having to have all of the details included and although the application might make it seem like that and so again if that some details that you want to go over with us individually you know shoot us that question shoot us an email and we can get in those details but we think that the program does allow small organizations to give it that best shot to put forward a competitive application so they can get money to hire those Consultants to do the planning for their project thank you Clint great and the next question is about section six of the planning Grant application which is please describe the market for the energy produced by the um and their question is can you elaborate on that and Clay do you want to jump on that one yeah that's that's pretty basic you know for for solar PV that would be net meter you know so the market is at your net metered with your utility and it's going um you know that's the market that you have available as you know a small business or a small public body or even residential you know that's what's available to us larger projects might have more details in selling you know having power purchase agreements and things like that would be the market um a hydro project would be either it's Supply and energy directly locally back to let's say a water treatment plant they're using it internally that's their Market or a hydro that is producing electricity that then gets net metered back to their utility the market is selling it back to the utility under whatever rules we have under the Public Utility Commission okay we've got a couple more questions um if someone's already started planning uh would they still be eligible for the planning Grant uh the answer is is that and this does come uh from the rules that uh all reasonable planning costs that are incurred after the application deadline uh all the way through from that moment would be eligible or those eligible costs would be eligible for the grant um that's all I'm seeing for written questions is there anyone that wants to raise their hand in these last couple minutes I know that we'll give it just a couple just give it another a few bits for those questions but I did want to uh just remind everybody that still on um there's been the Fantastic questions uh there's a lot of information uh in those videos that we just produced and put online and they're broken out by sections so you don't have to watch a two hour long thing and then the other is with that q a form on the website to make sure if something comes up after this or there's a follow-up on a question here that's a great place well it looks like we're um about ready to wrap up here um if there are any questions please make sure to use the Q a form on the um there's also the email community.grants energy.oregon.gov um those go directly to Clay and Jason so if you have any questions please let them know and thank you for oh there is one last hand uh okay what was the timeline did I I missed that for the next round uh the timeline for the for the third round not not this one that's coming right it's coming to deadline um we do not have that definitively scheduled uh at this time and we are looking uh ideally for round three uh applications to open up somewhere in uh late summer uh maybe early fall thank you well there is the email and reminder about the Q a form on the website um thank you all for your time and awesome questions today yeah thank you",

        "text": " it that was Ryan administrator so and just so and just so I because I have such a wonderful um audience I will say that prior to Juliana's arrival I really want to appreciate Brian zinc's uh support in some of the programs that you are enrolled in you are one of the few cities that's enrolled in the in our green future Enterprise program um and Ryan was really in goal along with um uh Robert Chandler they were really supportive so I want to give a shout out to them because well the mayor's in the room I appreciate that Wendy thank you little I thanks buy all right did you have one working yeah it's just a followup on that so like I want to think I understand it but like I'm not sure I do help me understand what the opportunity or the benefit is for somebody being enrolled both in the the current ly existing program like and the CommunityWide program because like I I guess I'm just stuck like wait they would be it's like the same thing but it's it's not the same thing so uh I'm not gonna say it makes a ton of sense to do both okay what I will tell you though is that you know looking at data across the electric utility industry customers hate it when utilities make changes on their bills to voluntary things without giving them the option right you know like there's a lot of drivers on our bills we can't control we can't control what a particular City's franchise fee is for example that's just going to get passed through no matter what um but we know that opting customers out of a program that they have already chosen to be in is a way to make customers very mad and as a rule we try to avoid making our customers very mad that makes sense okay but like logically it you'd pick one or the other you you wouldn't I mean it seems a little illogical to do both as the individual like subscriber rate pairer the the reason that you would choose to do both is because you want to contribute even more to you know climate change efforts or renewable energy efforts there are also components of our green future program that um are not just climate goals like we have green future habitat that goes to I believe like salmon restoration um things like that so you know you might want to do that because you might want to be supporting um stream restoration or something something like that that this program might not be funding okay thank you all right we are going to bring this portion of the agenda to close we really appreciate you folks all the folks from pte being here I think this is a really great conversation it certainly helped my understanding and I hope that everybody benefited from it look forward to followup conversations as well as we move this if we wherever this thing goes I but thank you feel free to reach out we're happy to have more conversations we appreciate your time thank you so much everybody thank you pulling this all together we really appreciate it thank you all right and with that we are on to item six and I'm going to turn it over to Juliana to take us through uh updates sorry folks let me all right so I'm gonna go through this really quick apologies um so first is did we have any more questions or comments on um the uh reporting metrics for um our oh and this didn't show them how it I'm so sorry um I sent out the email uh after last uh climate action plan meeting um did anyone have questions or comments on the metrics that we' looked at and counselors uh Phillips and Gonzalez I can no longer see you so if you have questions please just speak up testing testing did I jump up we can hear you we just can't see you so jump in if you guys have questions I can't see your hands or anything anybody everybody good on that all right all right sounds good um next we got the draft of the uh airport solar feasibility study they are working on edits they've evaluated eight sites on a few uh metrics including mounting types uh utility analysis glare analysis emission savings financial analysis and resiliency and battery storage and um as alluded to earlier um commissioner Slater did ask for them to uh see if could add in what it would look like if it wasn't just based on net metering um I don't know if they'd be able to add that into um the study at this point but we do have a good basis to start those conversations if that's what is needed yeah so can I okay um so the I think there are two options with the airport um the easier option and the one that we know pencil's out at least one of the options pencil's out is to do a net metering project that would um pay for the cost of the airport operation which was the original intent of this um so the second option which they didn't assess so we don't know if the pencil's out but we would need to talkg PGE is whether we want to look at the airport's a potential solar farm um as one of these under 20 megawatt facilities where we then sell power back to PGE um so what that would give us would be an increased resiliency right because then um you know all our power is shipped in none of it's generated locally so as Wildfire problems increase as the demand for power goes up we're kind of in a situation where we're completely dependent on pge's transmission line so one thing that that would give us is the opportunity to have some local power in the summer when we need it most the air conditioners are running it wouldn't do any good obviously in the winter right but still so I think that's something that that you and the council need to decide if you want to pursue that option I don't have enough information to say that a good option but I think it's just not considered in the report so there is two paths to this and I would just urge you if you look at both of them thank appreciate um the next is the urban heat island mapping so um Noah has a faction that is the national integrated heat health information system and they have an annual application for urban heat island mapping um it is open that application is open in December and they do the mapping in uh July August time frame um there have been a couple done in Oregon last year there was a regional partnership between Hillsboro Beaverton tiger and Washington County and um what our thought is is to partner and make our application Regional as well with Salem being the leading um organization on that uh for direct costs it would be about $220,000 they don't require the cost it is an optional but it does make your um application a bit more competitive so something to think about um and then it's about 100 volunteers that are doing about five volunteer hours each so um another reason for not applying for it this year we want to build for our 2025 to have that capacity and then for indirect costs um the climate action plan did mention that it wanted to be adequately compensating volunteers and so um I would like to go after grants for um a pass through to a community based organization to pay volunteers for their time help offset child care costs and um then have that be kind of our plan for working in the community and then um what I would like some help with is knowing what we would like this information for so part of the application is saying what actionable items would you you use this map for so um I've been talking to Gretchen and seeing how um the homelessness and heat response um could be informed by this type of map but if there are other um items that we would like a urban heat Island map to inform would be really useful to know and for Partnerships uh Maran county is interested in being a partner as well as um Kaiser uh had had some interest in might have interest as well so we're looking at kind of um 100 square kilometers in this area to um get now any indication from Counting assuming the health departments in the counties would be would find some of this information I have not approach P County but they are on the list to yeah definitely talk to that I that and I have some additional ideas about that'll we talk to afterwards okay uh hey julan how how would this fit in with the the U urban forestry grant that we received from USD love that you asked that I'm not sure if we'd be able to do those in the right time because this would be um rolling out 20125 I don't think that there's goes long enough that but it could if it does have some overlap in the time atmosphere it could help with um getting trees planted to where it would have the biggest impact um and then the climate Champion partnership so uh Maran County for um the past uh since 2007 has had Earthwise um they're now transitioning to Marin County sustainable business Network they have over 100 businesses enrolled most of those are in Salem and they would like to partner with the City of Salem to add West Salem um they have a new software called Green Biz tracker it's kind of the standard in this realm it's called um or it's uh from the California sustainable business Network and um they are asking for the partnership be because they can't work in P County that we would do the um audits the walkthroughs the technical assistance guidance and the certification for West Salem and um would also when we have available provide them with meeting spaces then um they have most of their businesses are Salem um and then we would also assist with the business Network and the annual Summit and they would continue to do all of the operations for Maring County businesses um so we are working on anou and it would be wonderful to have your support um if you are a current Maran County Business um or even a West Salem business business you can right now register um they have uh included us in their um in their business software contracts through 2025 after that we could discuss possible uh cost sharing but there's no guarantee at this point it's just have that discussion after can you give us an idea of like what like is that $100 $110,000 $8,000 for Marin County I think that if we were looking at the number of businesses in Sal it would be somewhere around half but I really don't know what that convers and then Community engagement so um Salem 350 invited me to their meeting in January um will at University is engaging with the climate action plan for a",

Fabulous following the mayor was sick but um they did a great job great discussion and it was good to hear the focus on the needs for industrial and talking about the talk and how long that took and and stuff so um the team did greatest in his in this represent the planning Eric barrier that's the first time I met um they did a fabulous job were they were they them it was that was the only topic and uh where Rogers was there which was nice yeah so I think it was really good and they let Jill in I don't know why I know progress is important but I still miss all the trees in that time every time I come around that Circle and it's just such a shine in that big building that car lot is or whatever that is now that it looks terrible that progress yes as you call it yeah what's helping us balance our taxes so we're not High residential we just actually asked about that at our work session because one of our Council goals was to start balancing our tax base and what does that look like what does that mean as far as commercial industrial versus housing and I think I was told like our current percentage of commercial industrial 18 yeah very low compared to like Wilson Village Wellington and so our goal is going to be around 45 so that's a long way to go but all of that commercial industrial to bring more time that's been powerful means yeah I get it I I it's um yeah it's just so is there is there any way that we can start I mean and maybe we do already have this requirement in there but it just seems like it's such a shame to go around that corner and there's there's no treat there's no Greenery there anymore it's just this big wide open dosed Hill and this big white building I mean can can we just like they do in some of the developments can we require you have to have some trees or you have to have some sort of greenery in there too so it's not I'm gonna have to go back and look at the the plans again but I wouldn't think that there's something in there so it may be it's all those now but maybe they're having they're gonna have to plant some as well but I I don't recall that was so long ago yeah I'm I'm sure the committee yeah it's got to be some sort of yeah all the trees I call him the Energizer Bunny and this guy he just sent us his quarterly Economic Development report and it was 25 pages long and in it details every contact he's made with a business here and a business there and trying to fill this spot and a business that wants to it's outgrowing their current place and working with them to find somewhere new and trying to get um manufacturing and high-tech in all the places on tea and yeah no um the movie theater is a little bit of a it's it's difficult but not by anything the city hasn't done it so just take a look at my notes from the market and we have three areas that are there's no sites in in the city buildable ready 50 acres or larger all right yeah um and that there's three acres that are available three sites that are 25 to 50 acres that are available but not ready order these notes from from the West Side astronomical from what they said right yeah um but most of the supply is less than 25 acres none of them if you're and I agree that trees being lost is a big deal to be in the Forester but I know they grow back um but the issue that Bruce was sharing is that most of our sites need to be graded and leveled and that means a lot of movement Earth to kind of uh so they're moving out of that area yeah that's that's what's huge now Roy Rogers it is closing comments saying I won't be here for when this happened but he challenged the city to look South that's where you should look for your growth so those of us that are directionally towards Dogwood that's what yeah where would that important a left side of Wilson Bill okay and still hasn't come back to me so we will continue on um so we'll go on to staff reports you touched on a little bit yeah uh so it just why I was thinking about it and typically September 27th is another retirement for an officer so if you're available for that day that's right isn't it they normally I'm not like Wednesday yeah that is a Wednesday yes 27th that's going to be for Deb Smith oh I don't I mean you're not coming for that one 25 years yeah uh so that will be here 3 30. uh I think we've already pitched on the blood drive coming up and then on the next next Wednesday we're swearing in our two newest officers Amy Lawrence and Chris sharp so Amy is coming from another agency uh she'll be great and then Chris sharp is yeah I'm sorry 8 23 uh for that one uh and then Chris sharp is obviously um one of our reserves that we're pulling up into full-time and he is going to be at the Academy in December that's as soon as we can get him in so you've heard me talk about the whole uh struggle with dpssd and what's going on down there they ended up getting their additional budget which is going to help so they're going to be able to add more classes but on top of that they're adding student numbers to it so it's right now it's a 40 student class they're going to go to 60. and that we're just on a meeting today although they're very excited that they have the funding and this opportunity the flip side of it is they're looking for instructors now and they're asking all of the agencies that they can borrow us and we're like well I mean for us it's just we as much as we'd like to send some of our people down there every you know about retirees yeah they've been they've been asking I actually think my neighbor across the street has done some work on them yeah she's retired sure so well the problem is is I mean they're looking for very specific skill sets so yeah tactics and Firearms instructors and so um the generalized instruction probably is a little easier but now they're trying to find these evoc instructors uh driving gonna be retired military I think it needs to be a little enforcement anybody contacted Sandy Flint to see if she come back out so she was a Firearms instructor yeah um well he's teaching down at Corbin teaching yeah she's teaching it's just uh good news that we have the money and and that is just now we're trying to build back and so again like I said although we're going to be bringing Chris on he's not going to be able to get in until December so you know we'll we'll see him next summer on the road good news we've identified our next SRO so uh we did our interviews and selected an officer obviously internally and so you want me to tell you I said uh only because we haven't announced it anywhere I'm always saying that letting you know that we've selected uh somebody and that again our goal was for October 1st for them to be in the Middle School uh it's not going to start a school year but it's all incumbent on backfilling so that's why it's really important that the two especially with probably Amy Lawrence whose lateral gets up and going so that we can move bodies around and yeah backfills so was it the school district part of the interview team right where the SRS uh not on this one I don't know really are they paying graphing it okay we only had one applicant okay so yeah yes okay yeah the Wooper will still be at the high school okay that's my board school board meeting they did some making some Kudos stuff my yeah yeah he's he continues to do good things and so he's very excited to have a partner to share some of the things that they're going to be doing did he get elected to the New York school board I thought he was true but he did and then went back we decided a few people aren't going to stop yeah so he's a busy man that's cool like a new baby yeah yeah uh our evidence Tech is going to be coming on board we've got through all those applications September that one's been hired and announced yes I don't remember the name but I remember she's coming out of yellow County oh that's right so yeah over 100 applicants we're able to narrow down and uh I think she'll be great she's just finalizing her background check and officer Collins it sounds like happy I know yeah it'll be nice all right so we talked about our touchdown National Night Out great event uh and 300 hot dogs and a couple hours gone they were gone yeah so um we're gonna have our game next year last week I had the opportunity uh which is it's just a big front for law enforcement in this mental health so CIS is our County insurance company that they they're pretty much the Metro probably Oregon uh representative for most law enforcement or cities I should say I was invited down to speak on a mental health uh panel at one of their conferences and it's all about what law enforcement agencies are doing to better their officers with you know the programs that we're offering so it's fun to speak about all the cool things we're doing and then I got to hear some great ideas of some of the other agencies out there so hopefully I'll be rolling those in here in the next year but uh uh it's it's really nice to see uh for the insurance agencies and you know the community just embracing the importance of Officer health and wellness um out in front of it trying that's better than it used to be yeah if you introduce or tell them about our sabbatical medical prediction yes um so we have a sabbatical program uh that we introduced this last year and it was part of suppose if you were in law enforcement for five years you had a 30-day sabbatical and right now it's it's split with the city and then your own personal time and the whole idea is that you're just unplugged for 30 days we don't want to see you hear from you yeah and um and so we have our fit out right now I believe it needs another officer to be able to backfill that stuff their positions",

        "text": " conversation it was also informational for others other business support organizations we're going to be following up uh with that access to Capital forum for businesses having an event for businesses putting out to businesses in Washington County saying come learn about different ways that you can get Capital to either move your your startup forward or expand your business in Washington County we uh do all of this work in collaboration with other County departments and offices um this is how we work we are a team of four we like to say that we're small But Mighty and actually I'm going to pause and turn around and I think I've got one uh Adrien Chalet from our team is here this evening I think Christian Salgado who is the Broadband coordinator couldn't be here this evening and uh Alisa Brasi who is our management analyst so we are we are four and so we uh we work uh with other departments like oeic with sustainability Public Health land use and transportation we are always talking with them of course in this one Washington County approach economic development is one of those uh disciplines that connects to all different things I appreciated the all of the proclamations the proclamation about bicycle safety you know it's about supporting uh infrastructure and and all of those different pieces at the bottom of this slide there is uh a list of some direct impact here from some of our work so over the past few years through uh your board's Direction and with arpa dollars we have been able to serve hundreds of small businesses in Washington County uh they have been able to be supported through one-on-one support Technical Services legal services classes and workshops all at this really critical time this critical time as we went through this Global pandemic which had massive economic impacts and we've been able to support so many businesses in coming through that economic recovery process to where we are today Workforce Development we also lead and work with a number of County uh uh partners and external organizations on a number of different initiatives around Workforce Development on this slide I just wanted to highlight two of the programs that we have been able to advance uh with your direction in support of arpa funds we're very excited about uh these programs uh we are hopeful that they can continue on beyond the arpa timeline the uh program up top and and if if you squint I apologize uh commissioner fi I think the photos are a little small here you are in the top photo though uh there this is a a graduation at uh the Quick Start program which is a 10-day training that prepares uh students at PCC for jobs and the semiconductor industry so a a crucial Cornerstone of Washington County and Oregon's economy here it has been a wildly successful program um I is in partnership with the city of Hillsboro and uh Intel and Portland Community College they've had uh dozens of participants go through this program and have acquired jobs uh it has been a majority uh uh the majority of the the students that have gone through have been women there's a lot of um bipo community members as well so we're very excited about this program and supporting Workforce advancement opportunities and one of our key Industries here in Washington County Westside works is a program uh that we initiated with uh work Systems Inc Portland Community College and initially the city city of Beaverton we are expanding it Beyond uh Beaverton City boundaries and this uh program focuses on um Workforce Development in in the child care space so students that are at pcc's Early Learning Program can get a three-month paid internship uh job experience with a local Child Care Center they can use that time as part of their practicum and and as they get their certifications with the state uh to be a child care uh to work work in the child care Workforce um and it's um it has happened through again through collaboration with uh all of those different groups I didn't mention uh Public Health of course is part of that and uh ccnr Child Care Resource and referral uh of course who've been guiding uh and guiding the work going so just two examples of uh Workforce Development strategic initiatives uh I said that we we we do a lot and so I'm going to keep going with all sorts of things here that we're working on uh in 2022 uh at your board's direction we started a program called cace cace is focused on sustainability in the built environment we got that up and running we've had uh a couple projects that have come our way and then have gone to the Wayside hasn't been our fault it's been I think it's been a difficult uh time in the market cycle for a number of developers we do have one in hand right now I'm hoping hoping that we can close that one in the next month or so so that's very exciting uh the Strategic investment program of course uh we'll be hearing more about uh this work uh later this evening and a different agenda item uh broadband and digital inclusion we're very excited about this work uh our colleague Christian Salgado has been leading up uh efforts to bring together Partners to focus on not just infrastructure expansion which is very important but also digital inclusion services for all community members in uh Washington County so looking forward to giving you a more detailed update on that one uh soon work systems in Inc we have an ongoing partnership focused on pre-apprenticeship and uh career Pathways in construction and that's been a very very popular program we're very excited about that on the right are a few initiatives that I wanted to point out uh the one on the top Washington County means progress and the RFA Fellowship this is a cohort Fellowship that focuses on uh equity and Workforce Development we've been um very excited to participate in this it's included some trainings with some other uh peer uh groups from cities all across the nation where we're learning about uh kind of good job Frameworks and uh internship programs and other ways to advance uh equity and Workforce Development the Metro 2040 Grant we're very excited we won a grant with Metro uh in partnership with unite Oregon uh to support unit's work in the creation of an equitable development strategy and Community engagement uh along uh TV Highway and so that's uh of course in partnership with other County offices uh such as housing and land use and trans transportation in preparation for more uh Transit and transportation improvements that are slated to come to TV Highway in the next decade the Supplier Diversity assessment project we won another Grant uh to assess the supply and demand uh so to speak of County contracted services so thinking about what are the services that the county contracts for and what does the demand like look like from small businesses and in particular small businesses within communities of color and why Washington County so we're going to be we actually just uh launched the RFP and hope to be uh getting a consultant on board to be helping with that uh very soon in this last slide I I wanted to highlight uh our our new website this is we're calling it 2.0 the 1.0 is just a hello we're here kind of thing and the 2.0 is uh is very exciting because um our colleagues led by led by Adrien and our team uh worked with a number of different uh business support organizations and Workforce Development organizations to understand what kind of resources they have uh that they would want to highlight on the County's uh web page and so we now have a resource directory for small businesses and uh for those seeking a job or job training and so I for those that are uh watching at home or here in the audience I I um we're promoting this now we're looking for folks to to go here and are hopeful that you'll be able to find uh the support that you need for your business or to find that that meaningful job so uh I'm going to close here and again I'd be happy to take any questions or comments that your board may have I hope that you saw in this uh brief presentation tonight that we're um doing all that we can to make sure to ensure your vision that Washington county is uh one of the best places in Oregon uh in the Northwest to start a job to start a business or to find that great job so with that I'll turn it back to you chair well thank you for the two of you for uh bringing this to life for us this evening uh and I I know I appreciate the work that not only you and your team members do uh but also with those in the network across the jurisdictions here in Washington County um I'll go first comment wise since I'm I'm at it uh since I ran for this office uh and started on this board in 2019 I have had a particular interest in our supplier diversity so diversity through Contracting or Equity through procurement is another way to look at it um but I realize that with our older Legacy tools it can be hard to put reports together so I appreciate all of the efforts that are are going to move the ball down the field uh while we may not necessarily know how we're doing along that journey I remain hopeful that with a new Erp and new practices it will be easier for us to do that so I'm hoping before the end of my second term that we'll have the Erp in place up and running and that will have a new Supplier Diversity report uh as one of the earliest reports that we have I know I'm asking for a lot but you know sometimes you got to shoot for the moon so we'll see um I will take that chair Harrington as a comment and question embedded in one um with your board's action on the consent calendar tonight authorizing the County Administrator to enter into the contract for the Erp system you are exactly putting that process um in place your board has been briefed uh prior um to this evening on just the significant challenge in time intensive work that we have to report out on our supplier diversity and contract and just general contracting y too and so um I would say we are Beyond hopeful as a staff team um of improving this process it will happen um with the Erp um system and that is why we are truly taking a one Washington County approach um with that process I know the OIC office has been involved um with Erp um as well as many others who have an interest in this no additional pressure just interest you know inquiring minds want to know so other Commissioners questions and comments I'd like I'd like to make a comment and first of all thank you for this it was a it was",

council has heard thus far so that's the the one that we will return to um and we do have a proposal for council so thank you to christopher clark he did some research on that and and has provided that and sarah's working up a proposal that we will have for council on that one okay thank you so i have the following announcements please silence your cell phones those participating via phone or

zero zero eight zero any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled so today we're continuing our review of the proposed order and proposed contested case order and exception hearing on the boardman to him and way transmission line we have kellen the senior citing analyst for the oregon department of energy and jesse ratcliffe department of justice senior assistant attorney general of the natural resources section we are ready to move to the noise control regulations and we have issues nc one two three and and so i'll turn it over to ms tardy good morning thank you vice chair and good morning members of the council for the record my name is kellen tardy weather senior sighting analyst oregon department of energy i'm going to do an introduction for counsel for noise um i'm going to deviate a little bit from what my powerpoint presentation had and we are all boarding the train and we're leaving council's standards and we're headed to the realm of the other applicable statutes and rules so this is going to be exciting and we're going to look at some rules and i you know i don't want anybody to just it's there'll be a lot but i'm going to talk you through what they are and i think that's the best way to set you up um for the background for some of the the pretty technical information that you're going to be hearing today regarding noise for the facility we are in the realm of the noise control regulations that are under the department of environmental noise rules and council has seen the noise rules before and we've talked about them but if council has ever wondered what are we doing making decisions about deq's noise rules i'm going to show you why and while i'm getting there i'm going to remind council that under the council's general standard of review the the question is is whether or not the preponderance of evidence supports the conclusion that the application for site certificate or the proposed facility meets council council statutes and then other laws and statutes as identified you know in oregon as identified in the second amended project order so that is where we're going and so up here on my screen and there is a little bit of delay so and this is in the proposed order so this is this is why council is making decisions on the the deq noise rules which is just what i'm going to call them or noise so the legislative legislative assembly actually withdrew funding so deq doesn't actually fund administer or or generally mediate or provide input for for their rules or implementation of their rules however the deq noise rules are still rules that are apply in oregon therefore they fall into that bucket underneath the general standard of review that the council must find must evaluate and find compliance oh great with my my sharing bar bear with me here okay so these this is the rule set let me see if i can make it bigger here for folks it's not working why is it not working there we go okay noise control regulations for industry and commerce so i'm just going to kind of walk through here these are standards and regulations we're going to skip over one those are existing noise sources what are we talking about we're talking about new noise sources so there's new noise and we're on previously unused are previously used sites and new sources located on previously unused sites and in the proposed order um the applicant provides information and that the site for the proposed transmission line is an unused site predominantly using information from exhibit k which is information about land use the facility crosses mostly efu lands and some forested lands but in one of the ways i think about it is like a used site would be a brown field or already developed or an industrial site and an unused site would be a generally undeveloped site the rules that fall an unused site are are more stringent than a used site so it is a more set of rules that would apply to the we're looking at this big b little i and then you know i i um so we're just going to kind of walk through this now also what are we talking about with noise we know we have a transmission line we're going to be constructing and operating a transmission line and so there's noise associated with construction which i'll talk about that and then there's noise associated with operation of the proposed facility um the vast majority of that noise is the corona noise associated with um with operating a high kilovoltage transmission line generally speaking the higher the voltage the more corona noise you may have under certain um corona noise is most apparent in conditions that have um like weather conditions that have light moisture so like a light rain that is light enough that where the moisture would amplify the corona noise but not heavy enough rain to where the sound of the rain would actually drown out the corona noise so that those are kind of the conditions in which corona the corona effect would be the most amplified so underneath here the no person owning or controlling this is where we have your the two noise standards and we have this i'm going to stop or start with okay so we have this the so the noise source here transmission line um are not allowed to the ambient statistical noise levels by more than 10 decibels dba in any one hour okay so that is one this is one of the noise standards we call that the ambient degradation standard or the anti-ambient degradation standard so this is where in any one the noise from the facility cannot exceed 10 dba the other the other noise standard is the maximum noise standard and there's this table 8 and i have it later in the presentation which i'll go over so this is the noise levels that are represented in this table so those are the two that we look at okay i'm gonna scroll down there are um so council will just see here it doesn't apply but there are separate rules that would apply to a wind energy facility this is not a wind energy facility um so we are applying the non-wind rules okay this is an applicable portion of the rules this is some direction about measurement and measurement of a noise source measurement points for um on on gaining data to establish what the am existing ambient or baseline noise is so this are these are rules that that provide direction about the location and measure and how to go about measurement okay the sub 5 are exemptions so there are explicit exemptions for um noise under the deq noise rules one of them that we that and the proposed order um does talk about um several exemptions the one that really that kind of council is the most familiar with and that we talk about in the proposed order is the exemption for sounds that originate from a construction site so noise associated with construct constructing a facility is exempt from these noise rules um they contemplate that construction may be noisy however there is a lengthy explanation of noise associated with construction in the proposed order because that's also where we talk and we pull in the assessment recreation protected areas and scenic resources we point to that evaluation to give an idea of what the noise associated with construction may be okay and so and then we have under this um sub 35 of the uh noise control regulations there are just give me a moment i'm going to check with my notes to see if i need to go back to my powerpoint and if i'm on target here with what i want to say okay very good um before i go into exceptions and i'm just i'll just leave these here but i wanted to talk about um and to give some background about ambient or baseline noise levels so here really what we're doing and these are for all of council's facilities what is modeled is the worst noise that could potentially come out of a proposed facility so with other types of facilities we generally talk about for example with like a solar facility what is the noise generating equipment and it's usually associated with the transformers and the equipment associated with any battery storage and we they have an applicant has to model the most possible equipment that they're proposing and put that into their noise here um part of the the noise the noise the maximum or worst case noise that we're talking about",

we help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future what we do the next part on this slide shows how we achieve that mission and the five pillars of our work our work on offshore wind shows up in several of these pillars both our work as a member of the volume task force and on the study that you'll be hearing about more in a minute the study focuses on a technology that can play a part in that equitable clean energy transition if we can figure out how to balance the needs and the impacts and the study is also an example of how the department of energy is bringing people together to problem solve oregon's energy challenges and support the conversation about this really important topic as requested by the legislature so again thank you for being here really interested to hear what you have to say and hope that you will come away with some valuable insight into the department's work thank you thanks janine and so i have our agenda up here on this slide we're currently in that first bullet welcome to logistics and in a couple of minutes i'm going to hand it over to representative rocksmith um and then we're gonna be um after i go over some logistics again i'll pass it to my colleague next to me uh jason ziermann who's a senior energy policy analyst with the department and he's gonna cover some of the background of the bill that created this study and what we learned so far in the process as well as some preliminary findings and next steps we're going to pause at that moment to have any clarifying questions about photos and preliminary basically what the slides are on the slide deck that jason's going to represent but i want to note that the focus of that part of the agenda is really on questions to help you um help us make sure you're understanding what's on the slides but we're welcoming public comments on this study later in the agenda so i might i might ask you to hold on a certain um question or comment if it might be better suited for later in the agenda after that we'll hear a brief update from voa we have um bone staff whitney here about it the poems call area process for commercial leasing for potential offshore wind development as well as updates from the department of land conservation development on the state's role in sighting and permitting as well as the oregon offshore wind mapping tool these are two agencies that are running processes and doing work that separate from our study but we work together and so we wanted to give them a chance to share an update since it's a topic that we're all working on we'll also pause for a clarifying questions for um staff and department of land conservation development staff but i want to note again that the focus on that part of the agenda is really about questions about the process and what they've shared and not for comments on the long call area you'll hear from them they have a separate federal process and so they need those comments to go through that process so before moving on i wanted to turn it over to representative rock smith who was the sponsor of hb in the 2021 legislative session which created the study and who represents oregon's first district which covers all of curry county and parts of coos douglas and josephine counties and uh director thank you for coming down and jason and all the members of oregon department of for all the great work that you're gonna hear about this evening and more importantly thank you all for being here one of the things that you're going to hear from jason is that my hospital 3375 did not bring wind energy to oregon boom was already going to bring wind energy and thinking about when when energy working so we needed a process from the state to have all of your input as well as the work that they're doing so that we can manage the risks and as the director said earlier it's critically important that your input is heard tonight as it is as as it has been in the other two meetings that we've uh had through the oregon department of energy process uh i again have to thank the director and uh the department because this is an additional third meeting and it's an additional third being in coos bay which was not part of the process in the beginning because they really want to be engaged and happily engaged and making that all of your voices and input can be heard and it's critically important that we do that as we move forward through this process not just with odom but also with both everyone is concerned about how and where the sighting is going to occur and i can't thank whitney enough for being here and being able to help articulate some of the process moving forward so that so that everybody can understand and so it's just a pleasure i can't i appreciate all of you coming out taking the time uh both the fishing industry and we do have some wind industry folks here in the room as well so that they're interested in being here so that they can listen to all of your input and concerns as we continue through this process and i look forward to seeing the presentation and the great work that jason and his team is doing because uh they are doing some really good work thank you thank you so much representative so this is a quick note on how this meeting we will be facilitated especially for those who are joining virtually um so i know it looks like i'm addressing all of you in the audience but there's actually a camera here and there's people participating over a webex platform as well and this is actually our department's very first time running a hybrid meeting so thank you for being here for this exciting moment um and when we have attendees that are here and other staff here in person as well as attendees and participants on the webex platform we also have one who um wanted to be here in person but was sick and so he's going to be presenting online but we'll run his and for those of you um on webex the panelists that you see are odo staff and presenters who are either presenting or running the webex platform will be helping to look at chat questions and helping to let us know if there's questions coming in online and attendees and participants of the meeting and they're called attendees in the webex platform so just a quick orientation for that and also for our meetings we'd like to share some community agreements that our uses to help encourage a helpful and inclusive meeting so some of these points might feel obvious but we've just found them to be kind of a helpful reminder and being in a space with a lot of other people first of all just thank you for being here and being present ready to learn new things a reminder to be respectful to others when making comments and and that sometimes learning happens outside of our comfort zones and that's a feeling that no one likes but we found it helpful to listen first and learn second uh oh sorry we found it helpful to listen to learn first and then supply information or other perspectives second and finally even though we've had two years of experience doing virtual meetings sometimes things still happen and especially today since it's our first time doing a hybrid meeting so thank you in advance for being flexible and patient around any technology challenges that we might have for those of you participating online and if something goes awry with webex please let us know so that our staff can try to help you can contact the host in chat you can also send an email to linda ross her email address is lynda.ross and if web express isn't working for you we can help coordinate someone from our staff to help you so a few options for providing feedback today as i mentioned when we were covering the agenda we're going to be pausing briefly for clarifying the questions and we've structured the meeting to have the oral comments after the presentations and clarifying questions during the public comment portion of the agenda uh we'll be forming sort of a comment queue for anyone wishing to provide feedback or provide input and we'll try to alternate between in-person comments as well as online attendees so for those of you in the audience here you may have seen my colleague erica with a sign-in sheet at the front you can add her name to that sign-in sheet um and we will just go in the order um that we see in the um sign-in sheet i'll also say that the the microphone here is really important to use although we'll have a roving",

        "text": " local government representation it now appears uh in the recommendation about voting members I think I see three options for how we could handle the local governments we could leave it where it is in the voting members move it to the non-voting members or include text that talks about the importance of uh doing more Outreach and engagement with uh local governments uh to inform our work and to make sure they're informed um by ours we had conversations about the other two editions and we checked in with agencies um and some other uh collaborate collaborators uh about those proposed changes uh might be good for us to reach out to folks like the league of cities and Association of counties to talk they would like to be included in the which I think would lean towards maybe including texts that talks about text rather than putting them in one slot or the other um this app also flagged for us that putting local governments in the non-voting number might there might be some statutory challenges to that so those are the things that I think um under consideration are there other recommendations that Commissioners want to flag for additional conversation uh director uh commissioner Decker sorry um many many different titles uh rolling around here hey um I just wanted to make a comment on um the recommendation of 5D I think it is on agency reporting and um I I know that this commission has recognized sort of how much implementation work different agencies have and and um uh in the course of doing that work right a lot of information is is produced at least from the Public Utility Commission um whether through um the utility clean energy plans um that the commission reviews and issues decisions on or otherwise um I I just I know that you've said sort of that existing agency reporting uh will be assessed and leveraged to support a new uh reporting requirement but I guess I I don't need a change in the wording I guess I just wanted to say for the record that there is other publicly available information that doesn't necessarily qualify as you know reporting uh to someone that uh would be pertinent and I um assessed and leveraged before new uh reporting requirements were uh again I'm not looking uh to to make a change necessarily to the language there but just because of the demands on our staff's time as as Zach as well um I just wanted to put out there that comment that um reporting is sort of uh an additional lift to the work that we're doing absolutely commissioner Decker and um I I know uh at least speaking for myself um I want to do as much as I can to to minimize any burdens for doing new things uh that aren't about reducing client reducing greenhouse gas emissions so we want the agencies to stay as focused on that as possible so uh thank you I appreciate that thanks for taking the comment we will definitely keep that well in mind and make sure that whatever reporting we're asking for is is is as efficient for you as possible Zach did you wanna weigh in on other things you think we need to talk about thanks Sarah McDonald I raised my hand because I just wanted to clarify on the local government piece um either now or when we get to that on my ex-officio comment just uh to provide some more details so um I can do that later thanks any other need to go back and have a deeper conversation about other other sub um so on 2C and the discussion that we had about splitting those two our commissioners do we does anybody have any concerns about us uh giving authority to the staff to draft a new recommendation or actually you know split those two recommendations and um as we've discussed I'm comfortable with that uh certainly could would weigh in myself uh in in conjunction with staff but I'm comfortable that the conversation that we had provides enough Direction commissioner rietman yes I agree thank you see any other concerns I support that as great thank you commissioner Ford on 3A I propose to add and identify key enabling actions to the action implementation plan descriptions so I wouldn't be a change to the headline of the recommendation but just include it as one of the key pieces of information that we'd like to see in the aips concerns about adding that in see any then on four do we need to have or are there other things in three that Commissioners wanted to have further conversations about on um four I think we had a pretty good conversation about how we wanted to try reframe the description of 4B people good with where we landed on that on uh the so now we are to the local government so Zach do you want to jump in with yeah thanks Donald um it was the lawyer in me speaking on the details just trying to make sure so um the non-voting members right now are ex-officio based on the title of their office so it made me think particularly with a conversation around um uh potentially having uh someone from uh the league of Oregon cities or um AOC that just wanted to make sure that I understood whether the commission wanted definitely an elected local government uh official or was okay with um something different and I'll say that the commission can recommend however it would like to recommend because these are recommendations to the legislature good point so I had outlined three potential options leaving it where it is moving it to a non-voting number uh or just considering including text within the description about the commission's interest in having um expertise in local governments uh among the commission seats that we have and more broadly potentially on the to the point that you raised Zach if we if we said something along the lines of the director of the league of Oregon cities and Association of Oregon counties that would be a way to get up kind of naming those without in the same fashion that we do with the agencies with that work yeah I think it's pretty simple just you know whether it's a local um it doesn't have to be a local elected uh I think it's the clarification I think it's me well I just have it be local government not name anybody so any preferences amongst the Commissioners regarding one of those one of those three options voting non-voting or just text in the cons in in that recommendation I would recommend that we we just included in the text that's kind of where I was leaning to commissioner Reedman any support that I would support that yeah we're supposed to support that me dissenting opinions and then uh just based on the conversations that we had earlier and uh commissioner deckers um comments uh maybe give staff The uh add a little bit of emphasis around the how we want to see that reporting and make sure that it's as efficient as for the agencies so that they can put their time and attention to implementing the programs that we're talking about uh potentially try and reflect some of Eric strength's comments to us as well uh in in that somewhere in that section uh you know recognizing that we also had conversations about the differences between government government and um and businesses but potentially we could add just The Importance of Being transparent and accountable and making sure our dashboard focuses on and you know links to processes that are ongoing but really interested to make sure we're emphasizing the importance of chair McDonald yes commissioner rietman I think that's a good summary and and yes I would give trust the staff to draft the wording based on on our discussion thank you sir anything else that people want to discuss before we try and get a motion okay hearing none would someone like to make a motion sure uh commissioner rietman here I would uh move to adopt the changes as presented and as I guess as we will um see the the wording I I should we put this off because until we actually see the wording that I would prefer us to make a vote on the all of the recommendations today all that we can anyway and if um and and then trust my motion then is is to uh adopt the all the recommendations proposed today with the discuss Ed modifications yes with right with staff giving staff leeway to um put into words the the what we discussed uh commissioner Jackson is that yes thank you so it's been moved and seconded uh I any discussion okay do a roll call commissioner shippintower oh you're on mute I'm looking for a um I support thank you uh commissioner Wright Friedman well you made the motion so we can yes and commissioner Jackson seconded it commissioner after I support commissioner Ford and commissioner Sharon as important well um Mary has been represented representing David Anderson our um our our bylaws I guess don't allow somebody who's standing in for someone else to and is a voting member to vote so we do really appreciate you attending the meeting um today on behalf of commissioner Anderson but uh but can't take a vote so um with that the motion carries we have a final set of recommendations any questions from so congratulations to um again I want to just emphasize how much work that staff have put into this um project and I think it's a significant step forward for the state of Oregon to have a clear idea of where we are with the existing policies that have been put into place but um as well as being able to set some additional ambition for reaching what were proposed as 2035 goals by 2030. so really excited about this work and really appreciate all the time and attention the Commissioners have given to this uh along the way so congratulations to everyone Zach do you have any final questions for us relative to direction or do you feel like you have the direction you need and and Allen's apologies I feel like I have the direction I need um and we also will just be cleaning up any formatting or other you know minor typo things that we find as we get this ready and then um I think we're gonna have a quick discussion of uh next steps in terms of uh putting together a commission subcommittee to just do a quick review at the end before we publish it and than uh with the hope of publishing uh getting it to legislature Alan anything you want to add I just wanted to thank the commission uh for all the work they've done in this I believe this is the 13th lucky 13th meeting on on this on the roadmap ticker project so um congratulations to all of you for all that work done thank you Alan uh it's been great having your leadership on this Donald yes this is commissioner I just think certainly on behalf of me and I think the other Commissioners um we wouldn't be here without your leadership so um you've done a lot behind the scenes we I think are all well",

        "text": " of this economic opportunities analysis to try to address some of the concerns that you've had or some of the ideas that that you have don't be shy I don't think anybody any of you are shy well and uh Jerry you prompted discussion on the code itself on the development code which I think at least the EI industrial employment Zone language is um is good is fair uh reasonable I'm I'm not uh necessarily identifying a lot of areas for improvement there per se um but yeah kind of what Bruce is hitting on and and some of the bullet points here uh relating to annexation and infrastructure I think uh would would be really impactful uh and I'm curious you know when you say the Tonkin employment area I'm assuming that includes the the gun um the Tri-County Gun Club is that is that right Bruce well you know and maybe Erica would have a comment about that but I think I think the council was really focusing in this because it doesn't say anything more than this I think they were focusing really on how do we complete the current Tonkin employment area but obviously I'm inter I'm very interested in trying to see if there's some opportunities over time to expand the boundaries of the talk and employment area uh which would then have to be outside the urban growth boundary because frankly I see over the next and and uh next X number of years that The Talk The usable land frankly the usable land and the talking employment area that's of suitable size are really going to be done they're going to be spoken for uh where that's feasible where the slopes are not too significant and where this potential for infrastructure to come come in and and uh and where land can be assembled because there's a lot of smaller properties in that in the interior areas so I I don't know if it includes that but I think your comments with that or that would be appreciated of course yeah well I mean it was kind of a baseline question um back to the uh the analysis of uh of what area we have relative to what area we need by way of office and Industrial uh land and you know I missed a lot of meetings so I wasn't sure uh what was included in that Baseline and and Tonkin is a large area most of which I think is probably in the city of Tualatin anyway sort of east of 124th um but regardless a lot of the developments like hours that you mentioned Bruce the one behind me um you know we had to Annex and um you know that has its own set of um same with uh you know the curb property the the Schnitzer property I think still needs to Annex and I'm looking at a city boundary along that that Eastern side um Sherwood West will need to Annex there's something around annexation that that I think may be prime one of the things that uh caused me uh as the developer a little bit of consternation was not being I had to Annex before anything else um before city of Sherwood say could sign off on a traffic study or utility study or even have a pre-app things like um so maybe there's some flexibility in sort of the sequence and we can get a you know unofficial quote-unquote uh look at some things before annexation uh um what would be an idea around that so I've come across that in other states where they have pre-annexation approaches and I don't know if you can do that in Oregon I'm too young in Oregon well you can yeah you can do a you can do an annexation yeah you can do a development agreement around uh annexation agreement that sort of lays it all out and allows you to to get going um and we've done that elsewhere I have a thought about annexation too I can mention um so whether it's that is certainly one factor is what it's required to be done and how much progress you can make but also just the ease of annexation really varies really widely across the region so some jurisdictions you have to submit a whole application with a whole narrative and have your consultant do all this stuff and it takes a long time and in others it's literally a one-page form with just the property owners information and signatures needed so and that's you know that's that's Happy Valley which is really Pro annexation and has been doing a lot of annexation so you could look at the code and now I think it still takes no I think it's only one hearing so it's not it's still not going to be overnight but if the process is a lower barrier then you might have Property Owners saying oh I could Annex and get zoned industrial pretty easily and then I could sell my property for more money and get that site ready earlier yeah that's a great that's a great Point Louisiana and I don't even know from a policy legal perspective can you Annex a property without the property owner's yeah no you can try to Loop them though that's what they trade with Nike right you can encircle them somehow yeah that still doesn't it still doesn't always work tektronix is another one yeah yeah so what other issues are you seeing that that maybe should be should be the focus in terms of some of the some of the recommendations that we might want to make uh in this in this report uh just based on on experience I mean uh not gonna call on people but I know Colin has been very involved in Economic Development maybe I am economic development for many years and and has seen some some best practices and and maybe there's some things that Colin might be able to suggest or uh Nick from greater Portland uh I'm just throwing out some names here Nick from greater Portland what what he's seeing because he's working to recruit uh traded sector companies to our region to the metro area and certainly sees what they do in in other states uh in terms of encouraging the growth of traded sector and Manufacturing and and tech companies do you want me to go first yeah you can go first Colin sorry yeah I mean as far as the uh the framework for for everything that's here I think it looks fine I think um you know like everything uh like hairstyles and you know jeans uh everything's trendy things change over the decades we all know we see these Trends in our regional economy and that's that that goes for manufacturing too there's there's different types of manufacturing right there's a continued Trend into North America for near Shoring or rear Shore reassuring but also near Shoring you know moving some things to Mexico that were in China and then building more of a uh you know localizing that supply chain so I I think my my perspective is having some larger parcels and by large I don't mean 500 Acres I mean um you know 50 or 80 or 100 but having some larger Parcels where you can have Tech uh diverse Tech Parks I think are always a great thing as our economy changes and more morphs where they're there are many where it's dense as far as I'm not talking about high-rises or anything but I just spent you know uh jobs packed into sites uh in whatever sense that makes but I think adaptability as the economy shifts as we have growth around the renewable sectors things around manufacturing for tied to EB's Lithium-ion batteries and uh you know future Technologies um hydrogen Technologies Etc I'm not I'm not talking about a science fiction novel but just saying as long as you're as long as the goals and the zoning allow for flexibility to capture future growth that's very key and then the other you know I guess I'll go back to the personal size and I think Kirk Kirk could uh chime in on this but I think it's it tends to be easier to develop Parcels that are a little bit larger versus orphan parcels and I know over the years um there's there's been lots of sites around Metro you know 12 acres eight acres here at their kind of infill but if you have some nice sized rectangular or Square Parcels um that would be something to to strive for but I like you know I like your idea of Shifting towards higher wage jobs where you can attract some of the residents of Sherwood I I like every I like where this plan is I like where you're going and I don't have any you know my my feedback for any community in the region is just to be as flexible as as possible provide flexibility because we never know where the market is going to be five years four years three years ago I think uh I was in meetings and people had no idea government was gonna do what it's done so I just the more flexible plan can be and then I would also just one one comment you know there's think back to the trendiness of things the semiconductor task force it's a great uh it's a great vessel or engine but it's it's a bit more of a thought generator they're throwing ideas on the wall that are going toward to the legislature and the governor the new governor is creating a budget these things will all come together and there will be sausage making Oregon still has our tax base that cannot afford a New York state type of plan uh we just can't throw billions of dollars at one specific industry and and I just want to put that reality out there I think there will be some very uh things that you'll see that's my that's my guess and I I'm putting that out there you know publicly I know this is a recorded session but there there will be progress and there will be new tools maybe new tax credits who knows there's a lot of things on the wall but I think I would not develop your plan around this one specific industry in this one specific point of time but having a broader Advanced manufacturing um you know to where you might want to grow that sector of the economy would just being more flexible and more open-minded because we don't know how the tools and policies will really pan out uh I think there'll be a lot of positive energy and activity but I'm not I'm just a staffer you know I'm not making I'm not I'm not an elected official and I think yeah I think there's just going to be a lot of debate and uh there'll be new policies new programs but and and those will be coming in over multiple years and I think the tendency what I'm hearing is that this focus on high-wage jobs and Manufacturing that offer jobs or have a career path for non-majority populations is going to be a Focus right so obviously semiconductor has started to do a pretty good job of integrating women into the workforce of uh black",

        "text": " some cogent and cohesive manner to be able to track the decision making that's designated in rules so this table um which this kind of also doubles down or it this table was derived from the table that was provided in the proposed order which was in um and then that table got plucked out and provided to council and members of the public in our first staff report that table was functionally the ultimate deposition of what was there any change in the proposed order or not in response to a DPO comment Council Direction and a certificate holder response so this table built off of that because as we are aware that is that's what we're building on right um councils reviewed requests for contested case goes back and it looks at how sufficiently something was raised on the DPO what was the response is there still an issue how did you raise your issue and what are we doing now um and then I have stop V2 up stop v2h here up first um and then for Miss Gilbert on this same issue we have the forest Practices Act first I'm gonna focus on stop up there because for Miss Gilbert we said it's the same as above so um and then there's just a little nuanced difference in between the two so reminding Council stop b2h provided written comments Miss Irene Gilbert provided oral testimony um so there's just a little little variation there um however the vast majority of what they raised on the DPO were very similar these are our recommendations in the proposed order we talked that back at the final order on the application council did not assert jurisdiction over the forest Practices Act and council's review of the draft proposed order Council asked us if we could clarify that in the proposed order in which we did in the section we kind of went and basically lifted what we said on the final order in the in the ASC and and put it into the proposed order for Amendment one to just make sure that there's uh Clarity there um there's one important thing I know Council received the requests for contested case um and we put it in your front end of the supplemental staff report which is why down here I have facts and evidence to support an issue that was provided on the DPO and then over here in the request for contested case I listed facts and evidence that were provided in that request it's not an approach so you received there was a lot of hundreds of pages of documentation you gotten your request but really the request was just the written explanation that's required and Rule of the information that need they need to provide in a request for contested case it isn't an opportunity to submit additional evidence and legal arguments then that that was raised on the draft proposed order so in my asterisk here where I say yeah was it properly raised we say yeah yes uh to the extent you talked about it over here and provided as evidence over here on the draft proposed order we didn't get in a a nuanced anyhow because there's a lot of evidence and this list here is all stuff that Council actually can't consider in the request um because it's not an appropriate time to add information record secretary Mr Vice chair yes so just to kind of clarify going back to the steps in our process you know to to add a little more to what kellen's saying is at the conclusion of the draft proposal or hearing you know either you know at the hearing or then later on if there is a you know deadline for you know the applicant to respond the record is closed this is exactly what Kellen is talking about can't add new information to the wreck um so that's why you know while some additional information is submitted it's really not relevant to council's determination on this has to go back to what was submitted within the time frame now if Council decides to initiate a contestant case then the record opens up again it is a new evidentiary process in the contested case but only for those issues so that's that's why it's important to understand why we're talking about this is the record closes the record could open up again on those issues but only if in this case an amendment Council decides to hold the contested case so but please let us know or or please you know ask the legal counsel for any more clarification on rules and statute the record closes but kind of going back and why the certificate holder is allotted an opportunity to respond is that is that and the sufficient specificity of commenting or commenting on the DPO with sufficient specificity is to provide an adequate opportunity for the Department Council and the certificate holder to respond so by adding information later one records closed two there was no opportunity to respond to any of that so that um so then over here so the question of you know does the request raise a significant issue of fact of law that that the changes proposed by the amendment or that could affect the council's determination whether the facility meets with the amendment meets the applicable laws and Council standards so there's a there's a couple nuances in here we said no um one could say because Council didn't assert jurisdiction over this that's out of council's jurisdiction but it's possible it could be in council's jurisdiction but council did not assert jurisdiction over it articulated that in its final order further as we provided in this response here um baby okay well I don't oh so uh I don't have an emphasis here but the standard for the contested case is it's like laws that are applicable to the facility the document that designates what is applicable to the facility is a project um Idaho Power has a second amended project order and it does not assert it does not say that the course Practices Act is um applicable to the facility where Council has to make findings of compliance with it um nevertheless as the certificate holder indicated if the forest Practices Act applies to the facility they would comply with it and it's interesting getting and I just put in a footnote um so the second amended project order does say if the removal of trees would be necessary for the proposed project development and such removal is part of a commercial operation that activity may be part of the for FPA now it's interesting and we did you know talk with the Department of Forestry it's really we get into the nuances of of the specific definitions right and so where an operation has to have a commercial aspect which has some sort of profitability so it'd have to be that Idaho Power would be harvesting those trees for profit when indeed they're they're removing them to construct a transmission line so there's anyhow so that's just a little bit of clarification of information that's already in the record so um so one we're recommending count that uh Council not Grant a contested case for the reasons provided here in the staff report and then there's that we add in this second finding here the second Department recommendation and this is to address um the you know first first part of council council could Grant a contested case council could amend the proposed order and send it back around or Council can deny and move forward to looking at the proposed order as the final order so we built in the second recommendation here to say that no amendments to the proposed order would be necessary because what we added in there at council's Direction was a clarification that Council didn't assert jurisdiction on the FBA um so I can so I have which leads us here I can go back to the staff report open it up um so this so our recommended option would be to deny the request for contested case on the forest Practices Act compliance okay Council discussion questions counselor buyer Vice chair how so just to clarify the finding is that the council does not assert jurisdiction over the forest Practices Act consistent with the DPO on the amendment and with the site certificate itself and that if the poorest practice says act applies to any aspect of Idaho Powers project the Department of Forestry would work with Idaho Power to ensure that those requirements are met so it's not that we don't understand that the forest Practices Act isn't important and those applications aren't important it's just not within our jurisdiction it does not say that the applicant can ignore any of those requirements and that would be the case with other state and federal issues that we don't have jurisdiction over is that correct that's correct thank you any other comments counselor Devlin no Mr chairman okay is it and counselor choctote I don't know if he's on there or not okay well I think within we're at the point that when are we going to do this by motion so that's that's how we framed up the presentation okay and and the motion did somebody want to attempt we're getting that together here Vice chair I move that the council deny the request for contested case on the forest Practices Act because for the reasons provided in the Department's September 15 2023 staff report the issue requested does not raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect the council's determination whether the facility with the change proposed by the amendment meets the applicable laws and Council standards included in chapter 345 divisions 22 23 and 24 and this is counseling buyer okay we've got a motion is there a okay councilor Devlin Devlin seconded the motion so uh secretary Cornett could you pull the council and buyer Cindy Condon yes Richard Devlin yes Kent Howell yes Jordan Truitt yes motion carries Mr Vice chair okay thank you oh no go away one second I toggled with my settings here and typos okay so now I'm gonna go back uh to the staff report okay so now we're going to move on the adequacy of the bond oh I'm sorry I'm just I'm trying to debate on whether or not anyway the in the request for contested case I feel like Miss Gilbert for the forest Practices Act and the bond amount had pretty succinct issue statements um however when when reading them but basically we did the best we we could to put together um what we think the short plane issue statement is so but we have additional you know details in here it's kind of a long issue statement but we did our best to capture um what was what was provided in in it um council's rules um do require folks that are submitting a requests for contested case to provide a short plane um simple issue statement so we do our we do our best or can when we don't receive that to provide that so this again um going I'm we're going to stop with start b2h and then um there's a little bit of a Nuance difference in between what um Miss Gilbert raised on the record in her oral comments um compared to",

        "text": "miss les perkins has joined us by les um we're gonna see what happens here um and how many folks give folks a little bit more time to so far it's just you the lesson so we might just elevate you to a panelist and chat with you perhaps we'll get started in just a couple minutes give people a chance to get on hey there we'll get started in just a all right i think we can go ahead and get started um we have a nice small group and i'm kind of tempted to just see potentially if um we might just elevate everybody who's onto a panelist so you can kind of mute and unmute yourself um as you see fit so i'm telling my co-worker patricia to see if she can maybe do that not positive but it's such a nice small group and that way you all can just kind of control um how you interact because it's just it just seems like it might be a better better plan to me with a small group like this and i love it it's like perfect so we're really grateful to have all of you here today um and nice to see some faces if you want um we're gonna i'll um go ahead and kind of run through our agenda today and i think we're gonna do like a little bit of a um of a presentation and then we'll have most of our time for q a so we'll go over the program talk about us a project example just to kind of get those creative juices flowing talk a little about a bit about the application process and then we'll turn the powerpoint off turn our cameras on if we want or not if we don't want and just talk about questions that folks might have about the program um if you want to introduce yourself in the chat go for it well we can also do a round of introductions when we get to the q a or whatever feels right um so um i'm christy split i'm the government relations coordinator at the oregon department of energy um i'm here today with a couple of other of our program staff for the community renewable energy grant program and just want to thank you for taking the time i also really want to thank the oregon water resources congress in april who i know is on the line for coordinating this and helping us to bring this opportunity to you all to learn more about what we think is an exciting opportunity for oregon's and energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can support both planning and projects so um so this is that agenda i mentioned and then for those who aren't as familiar with webex i did kind of change the way this looks on you a little bit because all of you are now panelists so you can unmute yourselves turn your cameras on just thought it'd be better right um but you'll see that if you did want to raise your hand um versus just like literally interrupting me which is fine really um you can go ahead and unmute yourself um and then um but you can raise your hand and then i can call on you in like a more orderly fashion which might be nice too so you can raise your hand either by clicking on the little smiley face in the bottom of the screen there that you'll see at the bottom and there's a raised hand option or you can also click next to your name and raise your hand and then hopefully you found the chat and you can just ask questions there and i'll make sure um as i see them we'll either get to them in the moment or we'll go ahead and and answer them when we get to the q and go through them there so if you have something you want to ask just get it out there and then i'll make sure we get to it um let's see so any questions on the agenda any concerns about webex feel free to try raising that hand letting me know and it doesn't look like we have anyone on the phone so um so if uh so i don't have to give that spiel but um but maybe the others other staff members that are on the call if you see someone on the phone maybe pick me so i can tell folks how to participate that way all right so um let's get into the program a little bit the community renewable energy grant program um was established by house bill 2021 during the 2021 session and it was known as the 100 clean energy for all bill but it also included this particular program the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects to support projects in traditionally underserved communities and we'll get to that definition that they use for those those communities in a minute and to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and finally to provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and reducing local energy costs and one thing i want to flag here on this is the statutory definition of resilience is sort of this combination of renewables and resilience so you'll see that when we talk about resilience projects here we're talking about things that sort of have those two components together versus just strictly resilience projects so i just want to make sure from the beginning i say that we can talk more about that it's in the statute it's directly there um so it wasn't sort of a choice of ours but just want to make sure that we kind of all have that from the beginning because resilience can mean so many different things in terms of this program it's called community renewable energy grant programs so just know that that renewables is sort of kind of a check box along the way moving on um i mentioned uh that or i don't think i have mentioned yet that only certain entities are eligible to apply for these grants irrigation those of you on the phone are one of those one of those potential applicants otherwise it's tribes counties cities special districts other municipality municipalities the only exception really to sort of the tribes and public bodies is uh we mentioned consumer utilities specifically to catch co-ops which are not a public body most consumer utilities are um and then the other thing to know is that the program cannot fund projects in portland just so you know the reason for that is that portland already has a similar program a program doing similar work with a its own dedicated uh pot of money so um good thinking i guess too they're already covered so moving on to slide five um the budget priorities are also set in the statute fifty percent or more of the grants um have to go to community energy resilience projects um and 50 or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities so this is essentially a way of prioritizing projects so projects don't necessarily have to be resilience projects and they don't have to be in these um particular qualifying communities it's just we have to make sure we hit our benchmarks for funding for 50 in both of those pots and um qualifying communities actually comes from the definition in house bill 2021 of environmental justice communities just want to flag it's a pretty broad definition and we have as an agency in consultation with stakeholders and our advisory committee have not chosen to to strictly define this so the definition in statute is includes communities of color and communities experiencing lower incomes but it also tribes rural communities coastal communities communities with limited infrastructure and then finally traditionally underrepresented communities including seniors youth and persons with disabilities so pretty broad there just to make sure folks know when we say environmental justice communities or qualifying communities what we're talking about the advisory committee has been really important in getting the work done um we have one of the members of the advisory committee on les perkins at least one um and uh it was really really great that the bill set up this group this group worked together on program design and are now going to help us with our program implementation and then since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very busy standing up the new program in the summer of 2021 the department of energy staff were assigned and developed an implementation plan and that included operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency and in september we recruited that stakeholder advisory committee to help guide program design support development of rules that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on january 1st those rules are now final and our opportunity announcement announcements for the program came out on march 7th we expect actually our applications to launch shortly and we'll talk about that in just a second and before we move on to this specific grant um grant opportunities i promise to walk you through a project just to give you some ideas and um i know that this isn't a project that is like exactly relevant to you all but i think just kind of helps to get those creative juices going like i said earlier so um this is a project that eugene water and electric board or e-web completed a few years ago the city of eugene like much of western oregon could be subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake and that is something that a lot of folks on the phone have something they have to contend with as well and as a utility that manages both electricity and water services eweb recognized the recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within eugene so eweb considered community resilience based on what's called the rule of and that is in the first three days provide access to drinking water first three weeks repowering of critical facilities and for the first three months completing system repairs to restore water and electric service as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project and it's here at howard elementary school and they added a battery storage system and a new potable water well to an existing 50 kilowatt pv system that was on the roof there and as a result of the planning efforts we now have a facility there that includes a um potable water fill station for the community in an event of a water power of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and the school can serve as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the community which is great of course but it also has these water and energy resilience features and the school benefits from energy savings all the time and eweb is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during day-to-day operations as also just wanted to share the schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served",

        "text": " is not an option for us. It has to be cycled and moved. The only thing that we're adding at the moment is a 20 foot high height limit because that's not been addressed in here. But I see. And madam chair, I can't open my agenda here. So I just have one question for staff. Yes ma'am? Have we addressed fire? I know fire doesn't want any burning because of that, but what about from the material sitting there, composting, getting hot and the possibility of a fire? Do we have a plan in place for that at this point in time? When they start going through the development review process, when this starts passing through at that location, they have a site plan. They will be required to have a tank on site property. Right. There is something in there. Due to the conditions of this, I can't speculate that I'm not in fire services. But when I've seen these before, specifically when the stump dump burned up. Right. There was discussion about that in DRC previously. They're supposed to have larger, larger dry hydrant systems there. So larger tanks, but that will be addressed. Mister Diddy does perverse stump habitat over stump dump. Mister Diddy does referred to his site. Is there any, let's just make a note though that when DRC considers it that they have to have dust control for the site, whether they're chipping, you know, whatever it is, they gotta have some kind of dust control. So they need some kind of. So will that be a number twelve or will it probably let it be a standalone or actually a number 13 condition? We can just add them standalone so they're clear. Okay. That's probably the best. And I think if we went to the site plan, we did have a proposed height listed on the site plan, but it's so small that the copy that I brought, I can't read it. Hold on just a second, Mister Tillman. No, no, we did. We had a building height of 50ft I apologize. All right, so 20 foot is going to be that height limit, as I'm hearing from the board at the moment. Time operation for chipping and mulching. 08:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m. probably 06:00 p.m. is more appropriate. Okay. 08:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. for the chipping. Yes. Are you getting that? Yes, ma'am. We've got three additional conditions that are being added to this at the moment. Anything else? I just want to make sure he's going to mow the lawn. He's going to keep the lawn mowed. Absolutely. That's a great idea. Put that in there. I thought it was special use permit that y'all could add those types of conditions. So would the grass no higher than six inches. Yes, ma'am. I'll make sure that's enough. All right. Mount Cher, just to confirm, I have. 08:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. 08:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. dust control will be required for shredding, and 20 foot will be the stacking height at the maximum. Yeah. How many rabbits does this property have on them? I do not know, but I will tell you, when you stockpile the wood, it will create more habitat. We need to count them. Anything else? Okay, we have two wide. So my only concerns are sometimes, sometimes happens with these things is they just become a mess. And so what happens if they stop? And are they just going to leave that? Or do we have some kind of way to say, you got to clean this thing up at the end? I don't know if you put a criteria in here that if work ceases, then the site has to be cleared of all debris. I mean, we didn't add a bond bond. Yeah, that would, I think, Tracy. But that. So what we should contemplate it for these kind of sites, because at some point, you know, the one north of it and the one that's just north of that, they're all a mess, and they haven't changed. They're not going to change. Some of them are semi in operation, but, you know, everybody was doing this, and a lot of the mulchings took effect because, you know, they were hauling a gru sgru becomes, you know, six months off, a year off working, you know, one of those things. I don't. What kind of bond are you proposing? I wasn't proposing a bond, but Tracy set a bond. How much would we need for cleanup, Mister Tillman? Could it be needed? Do you have any sort of thoughts on that, that you'd like to offer up? You know, so I would say if you were looking at clearing a site that was covered with trees, you know, you're looking somewhere between two to $4,000 an acre, so. But in this case, you're really only doing loading and haul up. You're not having to tear them any down. So I would go to the lower end of it and say, you got. You got ten acres. How many acres is this? 1010 acres. 2000. I mean, $20,000, you know, should probably cover. I think that's. You couldn't get the truck to start up. I've got a clearing company and I'll tell you right now, if you paid me $20,000 to go and clean all this up. Yes. It's not gonna be. It's not going to be. Yeah, we're gonna hire you to baseline. You tell me seriously, that many yards, 20 foot high? Bye. I'm telling you right now, I only have so many. I only have so much storage capacity. But that would not. But that would not be more than my capacity. Well, I think that that needs to be part of it. But we need commission. We need to. If we're going to move to approve, we can approve it based on it being bonded. And we need to find out exactly what that. I didn't give you an unreasonable price. $40,000 maximum, you said. I'm talking about the hollow dollar. I said maximum for 40, but I really think is adequate. We have about $32 a ton of mulch material to be composted and to get rid of it. Right. But how much for the hall part? A couple dollars a yard. Right. It's more than two. Yeah. So $200,000 be a sufficient number? I don't know. You can, if you want to approve it as a condition to provide a bond based on a calculation to be made of the material that will be on site. And then they will have to provide the bond. I think that's a fair way to do it. Why you gave me that look. I wasn't. I wasn't. I had nothing argumentative to say about that fair method of the amount of material on solid. I was shocked because, Jimmy, you're not clean up. You got that, Madam Clerk? Okay. And do you have that as well? Yes, ma'am, I do. Okay, so we're at four additional items. How many years have we done? So that would be 15. And it's for five years with a five year renewal. One time renewal. All right. With those conditions, I'll move for approval. And you can tell Mister Berry I approved it like I will. Okay, I've got a motion by Commissioner Zalick, with a second by Commissioner Curry. Any further discussion? And this is for. Let me just pause and make sure. That's for the special use permit as well as the zoning. A one to b two. Madam chair. They need to be handled separately. Okay, so you gotta do. You probably do the zoning first. I'll move to approve 15 3.5. 2nd got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Zalek. All in favor indicate with an aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries. Unanimous. And I'll move the special use permit with the conditions second. Got a motion by Commissioner Zalick, with a second by Commissioner McLean. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Move the ordinance. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, with a second by Commissioner Curry, to adopt the ordinances. All in favor say aye. Any opposed? That motion. This meeting is even. Let us.",

        "text": " Oregon, to hereby proclaim the week of May 19 through 24th, 2024, as public worksuite. Furthermore, I urge all Hillsborough community members to familiarize themselves with our public works facilities and services and to recognize the important contributions made each day by employees in the city of Hillsborough's parks and recreation, water and public works departments. The community gathering will take place on Saturday, May on the Tom Hughes Civic Center Plaza. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, mayor and council for the annual recognition. Just reminded us as we have a lot of equipment, all three departments, parks, plaza, there will be operators there. Children love it. So please come down, join the Saturday market. So hope to see you later. Thank you. And you know what? The grown up club and grandkids are just an excuse for us to be able to plan the cool stuff, too. All right, thank you. And our last proclamation will be presented to Amy Williams. And this is for building safety. Whereas the city is committed to recognizing that our growth and strength depends on the safety and economic value of the homes, buildings and infrastructure that serve our residents both in every day life in times of natural disaster and whereas, our city places high value on ensuring safe buildings for the protection of its residents from fire, windstorms, earthquakes, landslides, floods and other natural hazards and disasters and whereas our city encourages sustainable construction practices, innovative and inclusive building design, alternative energy and energy efficiency, water conservation, and reasonable safeguards for the protection of life and property and whereas our confidence is achieved through the devotion professional trades, persons, contractors, architects, engineers, fire prevention officers, building inspectors and plans examiners who work you around to ensure the construction of safe, durable, accessible and sustainable buildings. And wheReas, in observance of building safety Month, Hillsborough residents are reminded about the benefits of safe, sustainable and accessible spaces, whether at home, at work, or at places where we gather in our community now, therefore, I, Steve Callaway, mayor of the City of Hillsboro, Oregon, we hereby proclaim the month of May 2024 as building Safety Month in Hillsboro and encourage our residents to join with their communities in participation of building safety month activities. Recognition. The work that the building team does here in Pulsboro is amazing. We are very fortunate to work in this city. The projects that we get to see and work on are unlike anything in the state. So you will be fortunate to have this building professional group support this entire. So I appreciate the highlight. And we do get a month. How long does it like our house? From David City Council meeting this month. And next, we have an annual update on the family Justice center. And is it, is Judy here? She's not. She's not. Okay. Well, very good. Welcome. Nice to have you here. And we're grateful for the work that you do and especially for those of us here in Hillsboro. Thank you. I appreciate it. And thank you all for always taking the time with us. It is fantastic to get the opportunity to speak directly with you and a privilege to share the work that we've been doing in the community. So I believe you have packets of information. Wonderful. So I'll just give an overview since you guys have all of the fine, detailed information. But this year, in 2023, actually half a year gone. At this point in 2023, the family Justice center, we saw a great deal of expansion in. We expanded the number of folks that we served as well as the survivors that we saw, and we expanded the number of services that we provided. So we were able to serve and provide services for more folks than we ever have in the history of the family justice center. And that was always a concerning eyebrow raising thing for me to say, council meetings. But while the need is there, it is encouraging to me that we are beginning to meet the full scope of the need. So what we know is that over 40% of individuals will experience domestic violence in the state of Oregon and over 56% will experience sexual assault. So by survey individuals in a year, that is not 40 or 56% of the population of Washington county. So coming out of the pandemic, we saw a great increase in violence and abuse across the country. And here in Oregon, we also saw an increase in homicide to talk with you guys about that last year. So the encouraging part for me is that our numbers are going up, which means that we're starting to meet the need of folks that maybe were not getting their needs met before. The other thing that was fantastic is we have been able to scale to meet that need. We haven't been in the position of saying we're all out of resources. We aren't able to take anybody else this month. We don't have any spaces left for the day, anything like that. And that's amazing. That has to do with all of our incredible partnerships across the board and bringing on new partners in 2023. We have now have 21 agencies that operate out of the Family justice center, which is amazing. What we are doing as a collaborative is truly transformative, and we have done some pretty incredible things over this last year in the county and started doing advocacy work at the state level. So the new partners that we brought on were Adelante Phuketis, and they provide their beyond trauma program, which is a truly incredible long term trauma healing program, culturally specific and linguistically specific. We were able to bring on sequoia mental health for clinical psychological services, as well as addiction and recovery services, which is fantastic. And our tiny little food bank that started as a bookshelf three years ago is now operated by the Oregon Food bank, which is spectacular. And we're so excited about that. Even today, we help some folks get eggs and fresh chicken and produce, which is such a different experience than picking up cans of corn or things like that. And so we're really excited to be able to scale that work as well. We also expanded into the community in terms of outreach events. So, as you all know, this community has always observed domestic violence awareness month, and we expanded to observing the three events that are in April, which are child abuse awareness, sexual assault awareness, and pregnant rights. So this past year, for the first time, we did a run for domestic violence awareness month called Run for Hope. And I was extremely against the idea, but everybody convinced me that it was a great idea, and we did it. We had 150 runners from the community, which was fantastic, and we're going to do it again this year. And this past April, we had our largest yet voices of hope event, which is the kickoff for all of the events that come in April. So Voices of Hope is a art gallery. So our survivors who have done art throughout the year are able to bring that artwork to the gallery. The first year it was in the conference room at the Family Justice center. The second year it was at the Heart theater. And then this past year it was at Walters Cultural Arts center, where they gave us all of their gallery space, which was truly incredible. They even brought a celloist to play for it. We had sculptures, we had large scale paintings, we had digital art. It was really incredible. And then had survivor speakers. So the work that this community has done to expand not only their recognition of these issues, but their wrap around not only recognition, but opportunity for survivors to use their voices in our community is truly outstanding. And that has also led to the increase in folks that we are seeing getting services to the family justice center, because it's not just that there are people that need help, it's that there are people in our community that now know and trust where they can go. And that is what has made the big difference in our rise in numbers over this past year. So all that being said, we served over 5600 individuals that came through our door and provided them with over 10,000 services, which, like I said, is the most that we've ever done in Hillsboro. We served 953 Hillsboro survivors with 1600 services. And so that also is the most that we've ever served out of Hillsboro in the five years that we have been operating. And the other really interesting thing for me is that we know that violence and abuse disproportionately impacts our communities of color, and they have disproportionate impacts from that violence and abuse. The family justice center serves 57% individuals who identify as being of color. And the interesting part to me is that Washington county as a whole is 22% people of color. And so that is encouraging because not only are individuals who are disproportionately impacted able to get the services that they need, they trust coming to the family justice center to get those services. And that is a huge benefit. Not a huge benefit. That makes me really happy to see that we are serving the communities that needed us to access those services and we are making those services accessible. That has been a huge help and a huge support when it was needed. That also reflects in our staff members. And so now at the family Justice Center, 83% of our staff members identify as people of color. And so both of those things go hand in hand. And as we all know, finally, I'll conclude with the big development in 2023 that I think all of you know about at this point, which is we purchased the new facility which will be the family Peace center opening in 2026, if I have my way. And it is here in Hillsboro. And we are so excited about that. There was a lot of reasons and a lot of",

        "text": " on work with some Property Owners Idaho Power is seeking to make some changes to that and also a refinement of the location of certain roads associated with the project so we as I said just received that on December 7th we will actually the notice yes the notes went out yesterday for that uh for amendments we have a certain time frame 14 days to get the public notice out so we got the notice out um has the website been updated yet if the website hasn't been updated to include the application information it will be shortly you said the relocation of alignment in an amendment is that um been different from one of the alternative yes yeah I think it's and I haven't had a chance to look at the details of it but I mean essentially if you think of uh you know the alignment going through landowners property you know I think there is some desire from the land some some landowners to shift that you know certain distance away from that fine-tune to find stuff yeah so definitely justifies an amendment um and we don't know if you know until we get into the review if there are potential significant issues or not um so the Idaho Power indicated in the amendment they will follow the default type A amendment process so they do not request the type B uh and just for those uh listening so in our amendment process the notice of the preliminary request for Amendment does not trigger a public notification comment time frame well a public comment time frame the notice is just to make people aware so they can go on the website and start looking at the materials if they want to the amendment is preliminary it's not complete there may be changes to that based upon our review so it's really just a a way to get the information out there to people so they're starting to become aware of once we issue if we determine the application to be complete and issue the draft proposed order that's when the next notice will go out and that will trigger the public comment time frame and a public Hearing in vicinity of the um and so we'll have to look at where the location is of the proposed changes to make that determination of where that public hearings can be any questions on the either of those perform one tonight my next project update Destiny come on do you know what the basis for the appeals are I still and Patrick might be better and they'll kind of field that question in terms of substance and process so if I can tell you who has the people they have in fiber opening briefs yet okay or is it a few of our stock b2h Irene Gilbert and Mr McAllister thank you okay next is the Cascade renewable transmission line so we recently received a notice of intent for that project if you remember um a year and a half ago they came and did a presentation um so we had a PowerPoint presentation as to what that would entail which is between the dowels and Portland the majority of the line would be in the bed of the Columbia River and would involve some kind of trenching work to cite that in the Columbia River so uh 320 kilovolt uh direct current line 1100 megawatts of transmission kind of capacity and so as I said majority of it would be uh it sounds it looks like sort of weaving back and forth across the state line in the Columbia river between Oregon and Washington so there'll be Washington uh review component there will also be a federal review component uh assuming that that will be the Corps of Engineers will be the lead Federal agency in terms of the land portions so between the Columbia River and the existing Bonneville power Administration and big inning substation you know it'll it'll kind of exit the river and then have an overline transmission line connecting into that uh that big Eddie substation uh above the Bonneville Dam they'll have to come back out of the river that will go on the Washington side below the Bonneville Dam and go back into the river so there'll be some on land components there and then finally uh in the uh at the Harvard PG East Harvard and uh substation that's where it'll exit and enter into that substation so again some online components there uh we are currently evaluating the notice of intent to ensure that it includes all the required information so we have a notification requirement um there there's an optional public information meetings but for this project we will do public information meetings you know along the the route of the projects to allow people to get a little better understanding of what the project is and what our process is um but we haven't determined that the notice of intent includes everything that's needed so if it does we'll issue the notice and and figure out the locations if not we'll let the applicant know what they need to submit and then last on my project updates is the perennial wind Chaser project so that's the natural gas power plant in Hermiston the deadline to challenge the council's decision to accept currently Winchester station's preliminary plan to decommission the facility as the final plan and terminate the site certificate has passed nobody appealed that so effectively it is terminated we just need to do a little bit of final work uh in order to clean up the record and provide a letter to the uh prior safety certificate holder without an inspector can you bring up the slide with the in queue so as we started last month um you know I we indicated we're going to give Council updates on inspections and incidences that occurred over the prior month so there are a couple of slides the first so the first two slides are inspections and the last slide is incidences and so this is just as we said we're going to be a little they're judicious in our what we bring out we want to talk about every single site inspection we've done but just things of note and then as we go kind of along you can let us know that maybe that's not something that's necessary um but we're trying to fine tune this and you can see the very right hand um at the last council meeting there was a request for some estimated completion time frame and so we've added that as much as I indicated that we we can forecast those uh this is Marcy um so I'm looking at the last one it's a to be determined who's going to determine that uh let's see that one oh I think um well so in that instance so the specific one is you know we had determined that they had not done the uh required fire safety kind of inspection training with their uh with their personnel on site so we said you have to do that um they're working on that now so I'm hoping next month we'll have a you know the ability to say that that's even been done or we haven't definitive date so you know there's some things that we um we can be definitive about I don't think this one we gave them an absolute deadline but that's a fairly short time frame because these are construction contractors that are out there so it won't be long but we didn't want to say you know next week or the week after because it may take a little bit longer than that that was my question my point is the kind of part is theoretically wet right now we're not rolling up on Fire season but it will come fast and furious so thank you yeah and so if any of those ones where it's a good point uh I think we'll try to do is any of the ones where we don't um whether it's the next month or the month after we will follow up on those thank you other questions comments um so yeah so the that one I don't need to get into yeah deleting Juniper so this is an energy facility the updated fire protection plan to include the current emergency contact list employee training and real roster map and GPS locations of turbines and confirmation that the north Guillain rural fire and Arlington fire received the fire protection plan so essentially this shows you when we do these uh annual inspections um you know what we're looking at uh we're looking at all the conditions uh marching through some of them are very big significant some of them may be smaller but they're all required to be met and this is one where they had not met that one so we said if we need to meet this and we're estimating by the end of the year but that will be uh that was leading to number 2A 2B um kind of a similar you know there was a requirement for a spill prevention control and counter measure that plan also needs to be updated so again as we're going through those operational conditions associated with facilities we recognize some things hadn't been done and then I talked about the state line next slide please looks like there was is there a slide missing so there should have been uh the first one should have been Hermiston power and off till Colombian yeah so that was I don't know yeah so the first one is the Columbia ethanol projects and we talked about that for the last agenda item so that was the thing one of the things that we noticed that that agreement didn't get updated Eugene Medford transmission line request they provide evidence to demonstrate compliance with the condition related to noise landowner and County coordination vegetation sensitive habitat so you can see that one should be done today and then for Hermiston power project natural gas fire power plant uh Wally's been doing an evaluation of all of the carbon offsets and whether they're complying with the amount of carbon offsets they've provided to The Climate trust or whether they're needing to provide more so as the you know we have evaluations have to be done on some frequency you know and they always estimate this is the amount that we're going to produce over a 30-year time frame then they make that payment we do the calculations but if then at the next time they've increased the amount of production then that typically means that they will exceed the 30-year amount that they've provided not to provide an addition of the human so that's the wall it's working on right now with all projects uh councilman how did you have a question I do the um just for instance Eugene to Medford so I'm presuming that the certificate holder knows the conditions and was were these um this evidence do sometime before 10 13. and they didn't provide it and sent out now this is a reminder that we need to have it by this date yeah so do you find that certificate holders are well aware you don't have a kind of a run book you know I need to provide this report by October 1st or do you",

        "text": " of things that we're evaluating and so I'm just curious about what you think about how to approach that for inclusion and for making sure that Oregon is getting the learnings that we need in our state and is still represented in the project moving forward thanks Kelly that's a great question and certainly based on what we've seen from from usdoe thus far uh it looks like they're really um they're really focusing on projects that can go right into the ground and get moving and can be self-sufficient over the you know over the course of about eight years there had there was talk and the notice of intent of setting um one or two billion is kind of a technology opportunity and kind of whether that would happen after the initial funding and phase of the hubs and the selection it would be an add-on later or not um I I got the I got the impression they're still kind of thinking through what that might look like um so you know there is probably some opportunity there um we won't know until we see the foa but I also am getting the impression uh from the association that the focus is very much on projects that can happen you know right away and move forward as opposed to you know contributing to more of that resource research development and deployment um you know that said I I should think that there would be an opportunity for smaller projects that are you know kind of pilot project in nature that can provide some of that um but you know I think that definitely remains to be seen kind of what we've seen in the in the foa and and how much how much room they give us for um you know building in some of that that research and development Jessica who's next so up next we've got Ken Ken at the risk of saying what I think might be too obvious you know I think you have to look first at what the usdoes uh information that they've put out has has said that they want and they have absolutely stressed Regional hubs they've they've stressed equity and social justice to Kate's point and you know obsidians uh intent is to use most of the money to to move in that direction transportation is really great but it doesn't have the scale and they've emphasized scale so our project even you know we didn't design it this way with the you know we were doing this before the money came out but you know um our our project includes a pipeline that would make low-cost hydrogen available for transportation that that doesn't have the scale at the moment to reach what the doe is looking for so scale is important diversity of end uses especially hard to decarbonize areas you know we're sort of focusing on ammonia to help decarbonize agriculture because it depends on nitrogen fertilizers for um and and Regional I mean they they just I I keep saying that but it's so important you know we've talked with several folks on this uh in this meeting about how how what we've envisioned as a hydrogen Hub could facilitate what they're doing and so that we're not just our project and their project but we're a project together and we've had other discussions with other parties who yeah they have good ideas but they don't really want to share them so I don't know how you put that together into into a regional Hub and that's why I said earlier that this secrecy thing is is kind of poison to what's needed so those are my thoughts on on what what we need to do if we can't tell a cohesive story um and again transportation is great but that doesn't have the scale that does seeking so combining the uh some kind of scale with Transportation as we were trying to do would be great now we've gone out and had some of these conversations frankly our bosses said that's not our job you know we're leaving that to the hydrogen Hub Group people of Commerce issue but boy I just don't see that happening there and it's very concerning hey Rebecca up next is uh Greg thank you good morning uh again um I think that you know as we think about the attributes of a hub obviously it should be positioned to succeed and actually you know secure funds you know accomplish the right things that Doe wants to accomplish I I also think that you know there are as you know Rebecca because you've been writing a report on it a lot of ways that hydrogen can be used and I think in many ways this Hub opportunity is about you know deployment and about you know moving to to scaling and about you know commercializing and scaling so that you can actually push down you know the the cost of the technology and so I think you know it's important that the Hub include um you know ideally multiple substantially sized you know deployment projects in addition to you know potentially some other smaller projects that help move the ball on on other um you know you you talk to the the research component was coming up earlier like that's one example but I think you know for as we look at you know Transportation sector uh industrial heating opportunities both are a little farther away but still you know kind of knocking on the door as we think about a big Federal project like this same you know also significant opportunities in the electricity sector um and so I think all those things should should be on the table um I think it's you know a deployment program ultimately given its scope and scale and sort of the regional character that they've emphasized um and so you know I think those elements uh along with obviously some of the other emphases around you know employment Workforce um environmental justice all those kinds of things that are are pretty important in any project so I think yeah and I guess you know for the point of this conversation too that it should truly be Regional right like there should be substantial participation from both Washington and Oregon um and that that you know that should be part of the part of the plan that I see up right now is Alan so if anybody else has questions or comments feel free to throw your hands up and just a flag for those of you throwing comments into the chat I'm documenting them and we also will have access to um the full chat the end of this meeting so we'll have those that information documented as uh thanks this is Alan later at TriMet we did we put in a uh response to the RFI as a consumer not as a producer uh one of our four uh bus garages in the future we plan to develop as a hydrogen fuel cell bus and uh the the projection is for us to ultimately be consuming about nine thousand kilograms at that location per day and obviously we need to have some kind of idea of where it's coming from before we can do the design and all of that uh I I don't have a whole lot of background on this so we're still learning um but definitely from my experience in other applications um for federal funding you know that core story of we've got we've got a hub that has multiple producers multiple users a lot of coordination um will be absolutely essential in being able to tell the sort of equity story I think we hope that having Transit as part of that will make a difference being able to provide access to needed locations for communities of concern I I hope will be part of the the story um but you know it's it's hard not to agree with the last few statements which is if we don't understand enough of the other projects it's hard to really tell that story so Rebecca I don't see any hands up right now and Evan and Michelle and Jillian I'm capturing your comments in my notes which I will share with Rebecca at the end of the meeting and certainly if you've put any comments in the chat but you won't wish to say them out loud and see if there's you know agreement or or additions to them from the folks here by all means you know this the goal of this meeting is I will just keep harassing you with is that you know to really get as much feedback from you as possible um and the next step um is that uh Odo we will take this um and we'll collaborate uh with our friends at business Oregon uh to put this together to specific asks and feedback to the executive board and to Washington Department of Commerce with respect to what what we'd like to see happen and by we I mean the Royal Oregon we I've got a question from Chris in the chat uh he says it's probably fair to say that this Hub is going to largely benefit Washington and it's clear that it is too late for Oregon to finance anything on its own this year is Odo looking at anything in the future for some kind of organ Hub of its own legislature or something to kick-start things in Oregon can Otto Take the Lead Chris that's a great question I agree with you I think I I think that every day the pie is getting a little bit more baked and it's always been pretty heavily skewed towards Washington you know I think part of that is an artifact of them being already pretty organized as a state and as a set of but also you know I really can't the fact that their legislature was able to find two million dollars to put towards this organization and and um you know we Oregon hasn't ponied up so to speak any cash um you know we also don't have you know kind of the same you know access you know to to different funding pots as them you know every state is different you know if there's if there were the possibility that we could get funding from the state legislature in Oregon to match what Washington is doing that would be great but as you know as you can see we're already pretty far down the road so you know unless unless we had it on good authority that that could happen and we could give them an IOU for next session I just I just don't see how any of that would work out so I I agree with you I think you're right I think that what happens with this Hub will be skewed towards Washington um they put up the money they created the organization um I think that for that reason it's incumbent upon Oregon to try to push back as much as possible to find that opportunity for for true um but you know I I if if Oregon stakeholders have concerns about how this is going and you know maybe start to to decide that they wish to to go in on on their own or form their own group I think that always within the realm of possibility you know Odo with respect to leadership um we're just not we're not you know currently staffed to I think be able to take on leading leading something",

I couldn't get it out time because it took me 3 hours to create it but advisor Barney Thank you very much My question is hey to the director and thank you chrisan for your patience these last few weeks and all the answers to so many questions we learned a lot about taxes property and also to Mr. Laren and the documents were very helpful and My question is more a clarification because hey the call extension talks about the property improvements extension prosecutor so what I mean is that the owners pay taxes on the value of the land true Yes that is correct Oh very good I just wanted clarify it Thank you very much thank you very much counselor counselor stapleton many thank you my question director is what we have talked about those are the transparency of the ordinances and How can we investigate and can we include it in application processes futures then the union carpenters gave us different options that were put into effect in cities in California I'm going to see them to see which one is the impact we would have because I also think there are some considerations in terms of the complexity and monitoring required So something like the mayor a notification or reports that are available and subject to request of or is something that in the personal something that don't be too complicated ordinances requesting an investigation or monitoring and it will have impacts on staff and administrative costs then I am delighted to be able to see them and also see If there is anything in terms of notification or a requirement and any eh for share any information of bosses or bosses in a project construction to see if that would be adequate without adding excess costs if It's something I'm going to love to see eh after going through this project that we have before us and also uh say hey the local contractors eh, they are not opposed to any salary, nothing more oppose illegal work than happening and I also feel that the intention of the union and the intention of the mayor's emotion is to affirm it We do affirm it and we are all I remember and I also think that when we want to be very careful when we say that there is a mechanism of report or that there is a type Avenue that people have access because that does not take into account consideration the complexity of the everyone's situation when they are in the workplace when they are working depending on how they got here so I really wanted to be careful in the way we mentioned it for know that not everyone has the same access and privileges as others I feel like what the mayor has in mind is the right direction for ensure that the work that is done in city \u200b\u200bis above the council and that We all follow the same rules and I'm waiting for your motion Is there any other discussion So we don't have a motion still some other question for the staff before moving to the motion councilor I would like to make a motion yes Knowing that you have an amendment, I am going to go to recommendations Ah second the eh Gonz\u00e1lez seconds the motion seon ago the motion and I have an amendment I want amend to require documentation transparent that includes the identity of each contractor and subcontractor and all companies that carry out work on site either a owner or contractor company other entity with the city at the time City permits are required and that the list be published and updated each month and a final list is presented in the city at the end of the project for each contractor and subcontractor identified the following information number the scope of work inspected to carry out the licenses and categories and dates of expiration of licenses and requires a license to do that job identification and numbers taxes eh And information compensations and expiration dates second the emotion Thank you very much and I'll go to talk about the amendment So I I talked about this and it really is a We try to shed some light on a difficult situation when these things they happen if they are happening I'm not trying to point out in particular that developer but I want that be part of the norm from here on forward and with hope we will we are going to work to make it part of an expectation to work in the city \u200b\u200bto make sure these things do not happen in our city and the I got language from the laws of transparency to which you made reference I modified them where I felt that the situation required it but again I want to be very clear and I don't want point out no rule in particular but are the ones that are here in which we can apply and can be our test case for this process and I am delighted that mr dcon does not He objected and I think when he says that want to try to avoid this aones and I hope it is a tool so that we all work together and that This is the motivation for this amendment. counselor discussion nord Yes I appreciate the emotion when I listen to a group of workers expressing concerns that they are not listened to that they are not treats us fairly pay fairly and maybe there is language barriers to seeking support eh So that the investigations are drive sometimes people are afraid to report concerns and is truth on construction sites in the offices that happens in all the Industries and I am very aware of and it always worries me when I see people showing up in large numbers to worry to show your concerns that is a step in the correct direction and also would love to see what else we can do in the future to try to prevent these things happen and send a message that if we want to have a project construction in this city we have to play according to the rules whether whether we ask for a tax exemption or not Yes whether we ask or not eh money No I don't think money point out a developer contractor subcontractor let's make sure that everyone are doing things in the light that everyone is subject to the same standards accountability and also Public Registry request is a great idea very good job thank you counselor of nothing counselor Barney sorry eh counselor today first and Then I will return to you counselor today uh and I'm not sure who that is responsibility to move forward with but there is some way to ensure that something in writing is handled to every person who works So yes we have a problem or we don't know pay that's the number to call or something very simple very basic offered in the languages \u200b\u200brequired for the people are aware of the support they have answer we want to call Mr. Dien no In fact it would be important to call one of the Knights of construction or docky constructions because I understand that these are like vacancies on the site work But he can come to the podium for Please so that everyone can do it listen and please identify yourself and Can you please answer us many thank you I am district 8 all our sites small or large there is a wall of vacancies shown by the T How much You are going to pay them numbers to

two languages \u200b\u200bin English and Spanish Yes and counselor with that I answered your question Yes, thank you very much. Thank you for responding. to the question counselor Barney Thank you very much and I am very excited about this project because there is so many advantages and I see that this project eh is in the in the center and the center is opening I see myself very sorry uh I feel very encouraged by There are concerns about the issue of the financial situation and the fact that There is a lot of uncertainty and a period 10 years is too long a period great I would feel more comfortable if the period outside of 5 years an extension of 5 years with a renewal option after 5 years and one of my worries and it's not a worry but we already tried $749,000 in subsidies and now We are looking for an exemption and I I'm really not on the path to support this amendment because I believe that we are going in the right direction eh with the and that project too if the tax extension is approved we will also have a requirement annual report including review of files and for affordable drives then I feel much better thank you counselor thank you for your comments and I have one to give follow up on what the counselor said Barney is that development site has been a empty parking lot 50 years was the site of the municipal council until we build it is a building I don't I know if they ended with the name Pero de Somehow we can incorporate the story in the name would be wonderful just because It was the municipal council eh And someone Raise your hand if you ask and eh I also wanted to tell you and thank you for the amendment because I really believe that helps solidify eh worries a way no requires a lot of work for department for drive is going to be part of the Registry Public and advisor H I really appreciate your amendment and I also admit that I don't like it when I hear people who are worried what sequi housing and the practices and union rights are in conflict I appreciate that the amendment recognize that we can't do it we have to do We have to have uh solve the housing cuts problem affordable and ensure that all rights are obeyed As He said counselor nordik no When we have a tax reduction but when we have a contract to see our values \u200b\u200band our workforce then I really appreciate this advice and really counselor thanks for your feedback and with the carpenters they understood perfectly well eh the need this project and moving forward helped not to write it but they helped me the documents to actually write it they were not to me providing like the bricks for this project is simply was a",

        "text": " has an issue for sure and then you know we try to be responsive and correct that issue as well as working with uh Cory Sweeney at um the weed superintendent for Moro County as well it's taking those lessons learned from our operating or further along in the permitting process projects and pulling that to these projects like all these documents are living documents and need to be updated as new information recommendation from County staff or you know subject matter experts uh comes up to date um and then just to I know there's a little bit of mystery of our um agricultural mitigation plan so I just kind of want to talk through how we got there and what what our thinking was right and so just to overview of the land we're using um predominantly not high value Farmland we're not using any irrigated land it's mostly dry land wheat and yeah we are expected to impact about um 3700 Acres of that land next slide please and so here here's kind of the reasons for a go three exception and just to be clear uh I think we fall under the that third bullet point um for other relevant factors or what two referred to as reasons just to be clear all right next slide please all right exception is warranted to allow a locality dependent facility that will fulfill important state and County goals by providing renewable energy and minimizing impacts on local farming practices and I kind of want to discuss more how we're trying to minimize our impacts on local farming practices next slide please all right location dependency right uh we already have we own and operate two existing facilities directly adjacent to the wagon trail solar project and then we operate a third additional facility there uh we're trying to group these projects as close together um one to not spread out all over the county all over the land the closer that we can get all these facilities um you know the more land there are adjacent to farm around and we don't have a bunch of little nooks and crannies within the facilities where equipment's not able to access uh additionally a big factor is having access to transmission interconnection rights as well as you're like okay it's cool that you can get electricity to a utility but can you actually deliver that power where it's needed that's also a big constraint that I don't think we we've kind of talked about so there's there's multiple factors of being able to connect and actually deliver the power where it's needed those are two different things and we are set up in this specific location to meet all of those needs next slide please yep and then this is just a visual uh display of all of our operating projects so uh the white green is the Wheat Ridge East Wind project as it stands now um and then the orange and blue outlines are Wheat Ridge one and two wind facilities and as you can see The Wagon Trail solar facility which is that purple outline is built right into the um kind of the layout of the existing wind facilities and another benefit of of that overlap is we're allowed you know we're able to share facilities between three you know in this case up to five different energy facilities right so then you have less operation maintenance buildings less substations less overhead transmission lines scattered throughout the county so we're able to share all of those existing facilities and not disturb any more land to to get power to the grid next slide please thank you okay so talking about our direct and indirect impacts to agriculture as I said we're expecting to impact around 3700 acres of aable land um and with no loss to irrigated land so kind of what does that look like um we had Eco Northwest do a economic impact study of you know what pulling this amount of Dryland wheat crop really affects the economy and I I I think the direct impact is is pretty easy to say right the the land owners that land were using who farm that land are being compensated via a solar lease right they're getting a monetary gain from the use of that land um the hard thing to kind of determine is what about the people who are indirectly affected whether that's tenant Farmers uh the local agricultural industry stores suppliers um and that's where we kind of really targeted what we're doing right um and so talk about tenant Farmers we have a great relationship and history proven history of Contracting the tenant Farmers whose land we're taking whether it's due Road grading Road Improvement uh you know it's not that we are trying to like displace them move on and not be associated with them we are just trying to substitute their income with instead of farming it would be uh support of the energy facility and we have been extremely conscious of that and intend to do so moving forward as well uh the other Factor the the indirect impacts of um developing agricultural land so through our study uh we're expected to impact approximately 487 ,000 um dollars per year of Dryland wheat and that'll be kind of the impact to the agricultural economy um and what we did is we looked at what are we currently doing like what are the real numbers in moral County that we are spending well luckily for us we have the operating solar facility and we know exactly how much money we're spending uh specifically on weed abatement weed mitigation so we took that number got a quote from our same who's located Moro yilla County who who operates who purchases his chemicals from more County grain Growers and also uh in Hermon and it turns out we were spending more money than the farmers were spending to cultivate that land and that's based off of numbers that Mr Rous gave us as well as the tenant Farmer on the other property gave us so it's like okay well I understand those are not dollar for dooll Replacements right I think that's like an important acknowledgement to to make but it's also you know we are still spending in the economy we are using local business businesses to help us out um and that's where it came from and so really that $500,000 contribution has nothing to do with offsetting the the indirect impacts so to say right because we have the numbers we have the proof that we're spending that money in the economy anyway really what it it came from is listening to the public saying like hey there's a need to you know help about these other people that you're affecting like what can you do to help us out so we listened to um really the county initially brought it up to me and sorry Tamara if you feel like I kind of cut you out but the process I took is I went to the the the shareholders were actually affected so whether that's Farmers directly in the location near North Lex I talked to Chris talked to Cory Miller and I said hey give me a list of people who would have good ide is to support Dryland wheat for everybody in the county not just people with the project and so I got a list probably five people I talked to every single one and I said like how much money do you need and what would you do with that money and the people that kind of stuck with me was Larry lucher at the OSU Extension Office doing Dryland we research because you know I think one of the best ways we can mitigate our impacts is being more efficient with the acreage we are farming and that's directly what he's doing right and so he gave me a list of equipment he wants I said cool done I like that idea let's do it and then the next was uh more County grain Growers I I spoke to their GM I said like what do you see a need and you know I think I I spoke about the northflex grite elevator just because it's directly adjacent to the our project you know they want to put in three-phase power need to do some shot creete repairs um I don't think our money that we're contributing will will fix everything they want but I think it's a good start and right we're operating in the community and if we need to sponsor another project we will it's just not you know laid out in writing um and the the other aspect that kind of went down was like how do we want to to do this because one it had never been done by the time I'm I'm working through this issue I told Chase I was like hey we need another month like we heard there's this need um obviously like not to like point out but there's another project doing the same thing um that I'm sure you'll hear about later and it's already been approved by the county but like we were like trying to blaze our own path and see you know what is the right way to handle this and and what we came to you know after talk to the stakeholders is directing the money directly to the people who need it to get it to them quickly right we said we want to pay all of it up front we requested from staff to make it a pre-construction compliance condition so you know that we are required to make these payments prior to starting construction um and they only called out 470,000 and the commitment we we made to the two parties was a total of 500,000 so regardless of what the condition is we are doing the $500,000 and that was just kind of like our thinking so I just wanted to clear that up I will say right it is a new idea and um I try to be thoughtful and listen to the community um on how to get there the one thing that I didn't do that probably right like next time around is maybe get Tamara more involved or uh go through the and no like no no like shade to anybody right in the county but it's like hey maybe if the county wants to be the administrator of the funds like figure out a way to make that work um I did not do that for this one just because I thought like hey the fastest way that I can get the aid to the people who need it the people were affecting is directly doing it before we disturb of the land and so that was our thinking we're not trying to like go around anybody anything uh next slide please yeah this uh just kind of talks about taxes like yeah we pay our taxes um uh but the the other thing that's like kind of important right is the operational jobs that it will bring right obviously you have the construction jobs brings spending in the uh in the local economy but operational jobs right this will give uh moral County three to five high paying technical jobs that can then be levied into a career at next a or any other Energy company honestly um and then right we",

        "text": " zone or across the alley so that would apply for all of the superior rural which is labeled two on that map and then the portions of the Oxford Hoyt overlay Zone that a butt that single family is owning further questions counselors counselor thank you I don't know if there's a waiting well I guess we could leave it up so um I appreciate the questions of my um I have several questions um and some of this is me thinking out loud so I appreciate uh your patience with me my first question in summary is like what are what are we voting on tonight I don't expect you to answer that question but I can kind of break it up into how I'm thinking about it I get the sense that we're considering removing overlay zones and we put off this section of town to this public hearing tonight but I'm trying to understand the staff recommendation before us with this public hearing is it both removing overlay zones and capping it at 35 feet or is it just one or the other I'm trying to get a sense of like if I vote Yes what am I voting for if I vote no what am I voting for well counselor we don't have a motion yet so um we don't know what the motion will be the staff recommendation is I understand it would eliminate the overlay zones and so that would just make these subject to the same rules that apply in in those in each one of those individual zones without any of the overlays so that would eliminate uh that height okay that that helps me understand kind of the free form of where we're at we've got a lot of information but there's not hit emotion before us right um I I guess my follow-up questions uh a few of them are I've heard that what it seems like uh in reading the testimony I want to check with staff but they also get this impression that maintaining a height limit 35 feet is perhaps you know one of if not the most important things to the community members that they've interfaced with does that seem accurate or is it really not removing the overlays at all um my understanding is that most the most uh contentious issue is the height of 35 feet so in order to maintain that 35 foot maximum height we have to maintain retain the overlay zones in some form so it would be possible to remove other standards from the overlays but you can't keep the height without keeping the overlays all right um you know I it's hard because I don't think we're there yet but I also don't want to you know I I need the process I got to think this out loud so I've heard you know the testimony of people tonight and the question from mayor which I think is so apt um you know what about this area uh you know is different and I've never lived in this part of Salem um yeah I have friends and family who've lived nearby here um and and I think that that is kind of the question tonight um I do get a sense though that the community is telling us that those people that live there think that this is special um and I I think this is where I have to you know just talk for myself I have to Bal balance the fact that this part of town probably has more privilege than other parts of town so they have the ability to come here and interface with us but that neighborhoods you know are inherently like they have complexity so I I get the sense that there may be something here that's worth preserving some complexity that's unique to this part of town um that that gives it a special Vibe or or more than a special buy so that's just what I'm trying to like balance um I guess my question to staff and trying to understand that is there anything that's objectively like different about this part of town you know towards the mayor's question um you know Salem's a complicated place this this part of town has had you know homes that have been here probably for over 100 years is there any way to quantify that and help us think about it um there are a number of um historic buildings nearby six of them come to mind just outside the overlays and then two more within the overlays there are historic buildings elsewhere in town time period that this developed and um the context in which it developed is its own um I don't want to refute what anyone else has said makes their area unique um everybody's home is special to them and so um I think that everyone's personal feelings about their neighborhood are valid um and I'm sure that everyone across the city feels that way what about the topography question and as it relates to Overlay zones have we had overlay zones in other areas where there is varying topography I know that I mean we eliminated some overlay zones in West Salem down near Edgewater that are adjacent to Big Hills I don't know that the topography was within those overlays we've had I'm not sure we've had any overlays specifically with that type of Tupac it's like Ms Andrew snuggle we may have some thoughts maybe hi Elise Anderson over here planning administrator you've kind of stumped us with that question so none of the other overlays that I can think of that we eliminated limited height so most of them either limited uses or allowed additional uses and then brought in mixed-use development standards to make it more pedestrian oriented but they didn't specifically bring in a limited height most of our overlays were on major streets like generally these overlays are and most of our major streets don't have a lot of topography outside of Wallace commercial you know it goes up as you go south but it's not really that steep or that noticeable I guess the way I would think about it is looking at the map the topography that exists between commercial and the properties behind it that would affect the height exists on all these properties that are mixed use that aren't in this overlay so all that dark purple on the left there's a very small sliver that's in the overlay for example and the Topography is generally the same across those lots and then the same on the areas further south and aren't necessarily in this you know map cutout that we have here so any building that's built there is going to have to take into account the topography whether they're you know because we're trying to require the buildings to be up to the street it's most likely the development pattern that we've been seeing where the building's up to the street um and then the parking is behind would continue one because the zoning is kind of pushing it that way but two that makes more sense because it's easier to put your parking behind when there's like a topography difference but I don't think yeah I don't think the overlay has really had that topography kind of close that thought on your question thank you that that that's helpful I think you're one of those so what you're saying is that we're any Redevelopment would be abutting the street on the commercial side but it would be with with the lower Heights that would be on the neighborhood side is that what you're saying I'm saying it the zoning pushes it that way so for um the the map on the right is commercial and then West Knob Hill behind it um the zoning says that you need to have your Billing at zero or up to ten feet so there's a maximum setback you have to be up to the street and it says when you're on two streets that have different classifications you go to the higher classification for that so somebody came in and they said you know hey I have some of these properties have three Street streets right and I want to put my building in the back we would say well there's no setback to put your building back there but you're not meeting the setback on Commercial which the zoning says you can only be more than 10 feet from commercial so you can't put your building away back here it also says you can't put your parking in front right so fundamentally there'd be numerous parts of the zoning that they wouldn't meet with a proposal like that so we would like we would say you have to swap it building on commercial parking now if they don't do parking so I don't want to say no building could be back there because they could cover the entire lot in theory with a bill building and do no parking or do parking in the middle so they could put a building back there but it couldn't be the only building they put on the it kind of depends on what they're going to propose so we do have two proposals in the works that are in these overlays are partially in these overlays so one is the former Quan's property there's a proposal for a new dental clinic they're proposing they're building up on Commercial and parking behind which is in line with the zoning and then we have a proposal for live work units on Commercial and Bush Street and they also have their building up on they don't have any parking behind their parkings beside because of the way their lot is configured so that's what the zoning is really trying to achieve it's hard to know you know people's future development plans if the market would support a whole you know a whole lot front and back with no parking covered with a building thank you counselor nishioka thank you mayor Hoy um I'm not sure if this would be for you Lisa orpher for Austin I would like to have you talk about how in a few areas that a butt historic district how the height has been adjusted in these Avenue ones and mu2s sure me1 and mu2 were created through the State Street project in 2018 yeah yes I remember the year um having flashbacks to the the shading and the shadow modeling that we had so um that project was twofold it looked at the street and did a road diet which is funded in the bond and then it created two new mixed use zones one mixed use one mixed use two and then we did that you know took that further in our Salem with mu3 at the time those zones were only applied on State Street but we knew that we wanted to apply them elsewhere in the community so we really created them with that in mind on State Street the area we're talking about is next to the court Chemeketa historic district across an alley for part of State Street is the residential historic district and through that I was going to say hearing through those hearings those many hearings the council adopted a lower height standard in those zones when you're abutting a historic district so instead of the 5565 it's a 45 foot so that was a",

the applicant is requesting to approval to install the security gate specifically a qmi store safe rolling shutter on the Eide which is the primary facade of the porer store build the proposed security gate will be approximately 103 in high and 107 inches wide spanning the recessed storefront entry of the Wild Things store Al the security gate consists of a 107 inch long by 10 and 12 inch head boox which would house the roll up shutter when not in use the front of the Box will be mounted underneath the existing a and face the interior with the back side of the Box front and Commercial Street and also under the proos security GES of metal and is comprised of ivory aluminum single wall slats approximately 2.5 in wide that Nest together when rolled up the ivory horizontal SL F within vertical side rails approximately 4 in wide on either side the security G is manually op and when extended the gate cover entry out there's a lock located the center of the bottom rail which locks the security gate placement it's open there's no Hardware attached to the the grab level below ially the applicant proposed solid slabs which would exure the entry but has since indicated that perr options available from this manufacturer may be feasible this image illustrates the dimensions and loation security this image is an example of the solid slap version of the security gate the applicant provides spe specifications for different slack options the initial application proposed solid slats the applicant is Express flexibility and has provided revised information that specify perforated SLS the larger image you can see there depicts style 51 which is advertised as the most transparent option the smaller engine depicts all three of other AA total available perforation options this application is being evaluated under Section 23065 General guidelines for historic contributing resources only guidelines f and g are applicable to the specifics of the proposed alteration in this case guideline F States additions and alterations to a historic resource shall be designed and constructed to minimize changes to the historic resource the security gate shutter is attached to the existing storefront the existing store mimics of historic proportion design but little actual historic material is retained attachment points do not impact historically significant material in terms of visual impact the headbox is mostly hidden by the ALCO header and the Side Tracks are install on of the existing window Corners the painted metal material is compatible with the historic resource there are no morees to the ALCO floor therefore staff recommends the SRC 23065 F guideline f is minut guideline G reads additions and alterations shall be constructed with the least possible loss of historic materials and so that significant features are not obscured damaged or destroyed the proposed roll of security shuttle will not result in any loss of historic materials and no significant features will be damaged or destroyed by the proposer when deployed the Royal up gate will cover and prevent physical access to the entry out it will not impact the remaining storefront display window assemblies on the facade however when deployed a solid slat shutter would fully obscure the storefront entry outo which is a significant historic design feature there's a product option offered within the proposed qmi scor safe rolling shutter series that incorporates Slack that are perforated in not sight Spirit therefore in order for the proposal to better meet guideline G staff recommends that the hlc approve the proposal but with the following condition the applicant shall utilize a shutter that is not up sight obscuring such as a bir rated design version of the qmi proposed security gate which does not usually obscured the entry of it the applicant shall submit the file design specifications to the historic preservation officer demonstrating that the shutter is not sight obscuring in build comments were received from Michael Livingstone representing C do neighborhood association confirming they support the proposal the building of Safety Division and fire department indicated that the applicant must obtain required building permits and that the gates must comply with adopted erress standards for the occupany time the planning Division and the public works department have concerns with the proposal based upon the applicant submitt and the finance pres staff recommends the agent approve the proposal with the condition that it should or not be C of secure such as the perras version of the proposed fi rollup show and with that I conclude my report thank do any of the Commissioners have questions for staff I've got a question um when you're when in the wording of this condition are you recommending one of those specific designs that we saw a few slide backs there a few options for the perforation are you subjecting one of those in particular or just one that works for the applicant we didn't place a firm recommendation but the the one the applicant was leaning towards it also factur um style 51 it has small perforations which give you less of a vertical impression because other ones have larger perforations they're lined up with each other so you'd have more you'd introduce more of a ver vertical so I think I think that we would the other ones may be acceptable depending on what hlc feels that we we agree with the manufacturer have 51 is probably the most transparent of those options okay great thank you commission yeah did we ever come to any kind of decision about about security gates I'm trying to remember where we were on this last time we need to make some recommendations or we need to come to some sort of a decision I'm wondering this can be a precedent for you know any anything that's perforated is seems to be perfectly reasonable I can thank you yes so um yeah we had a work session at our December Larks commission meeting to discuss um amending our uh standard design standards for store signs in our commercial districts and we are in the process of doing public Outreach and so so",

        "text": "great hello yeah can you all hear me okay excellent again just give us a um 33 36 38 40. uh okay well uh welcome uh everyone to the second public information meeting on the Cascade renewable transmission system uh my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy I'm joined up here by my colleague Cornett or Mike Michael but uh the Department's assistant director for sighting um there's also a few other uh Department staff in the room I just want to point out in case you have any questions or need anything during the event tonight um I'll call them out so we have Wally Adams you could in the back of the room uh actually the three back in the room are Wally Erica and Nancy sitting at that back table and also Michael Kate Sloan is uh oh back there as well so uh if you like I said if you need anything please feel free to get a hold of uh any of us and uh we are all staffed to the energy facilities hiding Council and I just want to point out that we do have a council member with us tonight uh council member buyer I don't know where you are towards the back uh and we also have a council member Condon on the line with us um the purpose of the meeting tonight this guy's not working again uh well Nancy if you could go to the next slide clicker's not working but actually did I just have the wrong oh that's like got it now okay thank you all for bearing with the the technical stuff uh it's been an interesting few days on that front great so uh just for the agenda tonight I'm gonna give a brief overview of uh the project um Todd is going to to introduce the sighting process as well and then we have the applicant team uh from Cascade renewable transmission to given over a more in-depth overview of the project and where it will be located um and and the why as well um following that we will have a question and answer session for folks to ask any questions you have or provide comments on the notice of intent um that uh that will like I said be after these presentations so if we hold your comments until that time uh as I mentioned this is a meeting on the notice of intent which we received on March 7th um that is uh was submitted by Cascade renewable transmission system or transmission LLC which is a joint venture of power Bridge LLC and suntuo partners LLC um just to be very queer they are the project proponents they've submitted this application to the department and we are the reviewing and permitting Agency for the state of Oregon um this meeting is intended to give you all an opportunity to learn about the project uh and to provide comment on the notice of intent um I just want to point out that it is not a contested case hearing or public hearing and your participation tonight is not required to preserve issues or or standing for the contested case that will occur waiter in the citing process and Todd will go over that process in a little bit let's move on to what the project actually is uh the Cascade renewable transmission system is a proposed uh 300 kilovolt DC transmission line with related and supporting facilities that would span about 100 miles between the Dalles and Portland the majority of the wine would be volume up and I can also speak a little louder sure is this any better people nothing and I see a let's speak we may we may order that pizza after all anybody got a good joke oh you need to speak up yeah I think you know or get closer to proud not sure what else to do you can betray power cycling the PA or does that help so maybe we stand up yeah sure all right so sorry about this uh bear with us folks I would just try to speed up otherwise oh sure the button was just okay uh yeah and can I get a quick check then uh from one of our staff on the WebEx that you can hear me on the okay great uh so thank you all again thanks for your patience while we work through these technical issues uh as I was saying uh the project is a proposed 300 KB uh kilovolt direct current transmission line uh that would be spanning about 100 miles between the dowels and Portland um the majority of the wine is going to be buried in the OR is proposed to be buried in the bed of the Columbia River uh with additional segments buried in Road rights of way uh or installed using horizontal drilling um the applicant has some more detailed information about the the exact proposed routes during their presentation there's two converter stations proposed near both points of um one of those points is the big Eddie substation in the dowels um which would connect to a computer station with about 500 feet of overhead AC line uh and then the the Western converter station will be based or be located on a site in the Rivergate industrial district in North Portland um that would be connected to PG's harborton substation with about three miles of uh line of AC line that's undergrounded or installed under the bed of the Willamette River uh using HDD I'll just make sure I'm getting everything accurately um this uh facility based on its capacity length and location is subject to the jurisdiction of the energy facility citing Council um the Todd will kind of explain what the sighting process looks like in in a moment but that is part of the reason why we're here tonight this is the very beginning of the sighting process where we're getting information from you all and sharing information to help us in our development of What's called the project order which is kind of our scoping order for what will be required in the full application for site um this this is so is a quick um overview of the proposed route of the uh of the line um as you can see there's a single Corridor proposed uh for most of the length of the wine uh with some alternate Alternatives proposed on the western end um that I can go over in a little bit more detail in just one um but first uh I'm gonna have uh Todd give a overview of the citing process okay not a mic check but a sound check can you guys all hear me great thank you um so as Chris mentioned my name is Todd Cornett I manage the energy facility siding division I'm also the secretary to the energy facility citing Council so the siding division so we're one part of the Oregon Department of energy exciting division has one primary objective and that is to review large-scale energy and we review these against the state requirements local standards essentially all applicable kind of requirements and I'll talk about that more as I move through this uh presentation so we manage the process we work with the applicant we work with members of the public who participate in our process we have Tribal governments state agencies local governments they're all an important part of our process so we work with them but we are not the decision makers the decision makers are the energy facility citing Council so they are a seven-member volunteer board that is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate so everything that we do you know in terms of putting the record together making recommendations getting it all sort of ready for their review um you know is because they're the decision makers we are not not ready yet go back please so the um the citing process is a Consolidated review so the way it works is we have a set of standards that I'll talk about but we also pull together all of the other state agency local government um you know requirements and permits and statutes and rules into one Consolidated review and the value of that is that um you know with a bunch of different agencies doing different reviews that could result in different decisions or conflicting decisions there are also different appeal paths so our whole process is designed to have one Consolidated review and if a project is approved then not only We There are we there for the application process but we have a fully funded compliance program so you know once project is approved we're there for reconstruction we have a host of conditions related to pre-construction we have conditions related to construction conditions related to operation and ultimately conditions related to retirement to ensure that facilities are taken off the landscape so we are there for the entire life cycle of the facility and we're funded for that as well we went two slides okay I don't have control you'll have to ask Nancy can you go back so I I'm we're two slides ahead yeah that one uh one forward please um so you can see on this uh slide here this basically has a list of some of the types of abilities that we have jurisdiction over um we have jurisdiction over certain types of wind solar transmission pipelines others um project obviously that we're talking about here is a transmission line so our statutory Authority um or the council statutory Authority in terms of jurisdiction is in the statute that's listed on the screen 469 311 and what that is is a definition it's a definition for an energy facility and that lists all these different types of facilities uh and the jurisdictional thresholds vary for transmission lines it's related to three different things it has to be at least 230 KV this is it has to be at least 10 miles in length this is it has to be at least in two jurisdictions and this isn't more than that so that's why this project is in our jurisdiction in the council's jurisdiction versus say the local next slide please okay so this and you know the handouts have something similar to this it's in a little bit different format but it really talks about the same steps there are seven major steps in our review process and where we're at right now is you can see based upon the border on the very first one is we're at the very first step so we are at the very very early stages um and you know as you receive the notice and while you're here it's called the notice of intent it's not an application it's not a decision it's a notice of intent to apply for a project and so very very early and so what's required in that and if you've had a chance to review the notice of intent it's really desktop kind of level analysis this is not an in-depth evaluation yet it's really sort of desktop level work to basically tell us the department tell you you know members of the public and then the state agencies tribal governments and and local governments what the project is generally and where it's going to be um and that helps then",

        "text": " menu a drop down menu that will have a lot of different projects on it just keep in mind that only projects with an open comment period will show up there so if you don't see Sunstone and you think it should be on there um because you've got a notice that says it should be on there let us know um but you know it might have already closed so that's just important to know so select the project that you want to comment on and then next and um you'll get some more information about the portal uh which you can read but we can't read now so um and then one more slide fining so yeah you'll get again more information about the project that um you wish to comment on that you've selected so you know you're commenting on the right thing go to one more slide okay yeah and then here you'll get um to the part where you can actually provide your comments so if you can enter your name and cont cont um cck create it's oh yeah and you can go to the next slide one more um and then there'll be a place to fill out the common form um and I think what's important to note about the comment form is that there'll be um an option to uh select the standard or section that you want to comment on um again the more specific you can be the more helpful for us um we do recommend oh and if you can go to the next slide I guess um we do recommend that if you're writing longer comments or more complicated comments with lots of pages you might want to do it in a separate document first and then just copy and paste in this form um there's also if you prefer uh to not go through this whole whole process you can just type up a separate document and then attach it um and once you do that you hit submit and your comment should be submitted you should get a uh um a copy or a confirmation immediately after that so great um great so that's the public comment form uh and sorry little dry but uh I think uh another feature of the website is that there is a place to see all the comments that have been submitted on the website from that same beginning page you can go to where it says uh see comments submitted and and hit the sighting docket and that should take you to every comment that's been received there so if you're interested in what other people are seeing you should be able to find that information um okay so similarly we do have a mapping tool um that is pretty helpful and um we had hope to have a video for you all but I don't think we um okay so similarly and we can goite quickly um yeah you'll start at the Odo and um go to where it says facilities fsec and then uh can go oh actually Nancy can you is is that little video down at the bottom that little video camera is that will that bring up the video oh no NOP that's that's for the webinar okay well shoot um okay so you can pick a project that you're interested in learning more about um and on that project page uh if you can go to the next slide um there will be a uh a subheading that says location and a uh online map and a physical map so if you just want to see a PDF that's available but if you want to see an online interactive map click online map and the arresta tool will pop up um when you get there that way you'll be limited to just seeing uh layers related to fect facilities um so you can use that leftand uh menu to navigate the layers um and then you can use the little plus sign to expand that list so you can get all sorts of different kind layers uh including uh all state level uh available layers from ODFW uh the Department ficient Wildlife the department of land and uh land conservation and development and other agencies um uh so to see oh and if you go one more oh that's you're there uh thank you Nancy um yeah and then if you're looking for a specific layer if you could go one more uh thing you can use the drop down menu to either search um again if you choose all available layers they will all pop up um and you can also search in a search bar there okay um I'm gonna have you flip through a few uh of these until you get to the one that says adding in fsec layer options oh okay um okay so if you want to see if you get to the map a different way and you want to see um all the fsec facilities you can choose the energy uh group and then scroll down and choose oo facilities database and then click the Oregon energy fac uh facility sighting Council uh facilities layer which will show you the the layers of all the facilities uh on the map that you have shown um that that would include facility and and all of them uh that are on the map um you then uh change a lot of the visual features of that you can change the transparency um by using a slider you can uh and you can go ahead and click two of these slides you can change the base map if you want to see topographic relief or roads or something like that more slide yeah so you can change the map um and then if you can go two more slides you can also view the attribute data to get information about how many megawatts of facility is uh uh expected to generate what the size is where it's located and Etc by uh clicking viewed details all right and then uh one last feature we wanted to show you um often people and if you could go I think it's two more oh right here perfect um a lot of times people are interested in how close is this to my house or how close is this to a road that I use or a park that I like to visit um and so there is a measurement tool built in you can see uh where it's highlighted um there's also sometimes a little toolbox on the right side um where you can get a measuring tape and measure from point to point uh to see your your site boundary um and and that will give you in the measurement of your choice uh I went through this kind of quickly I did want to point out these slides will be posted to our website so if you want to revisit them if you're trying to use the tool you can get that tutorial um also we we do have the resta tool pulled up on the computer over there so if you want a inperson demo we'd be happy to provide that after to meeting okay um and that's probably enough talking for me thank you all for bearing with me um so again this is my contact information I'll show it at the end and I will turn it over to the Sunstone team or the pine gate team uh to give an overview of the project hello hello can you hear me okay great thank you Chris and thank you to the department for um organizing this event and allowing us to participate and share some additional information about the uh proposed project um thanks to everyone in the room who came out and uh joined us tonight as well as all the folks on the phone we appreciate it and and look forward to having a good discussion with you uh my name is Logan Stevens I'm VP of project development at Pine gate Renewables uh Pate is the sponsor owner developer of the Sunstone solar project um by way of background I started my career in utility scale Solar Development back in 2011 and my current role at Pine gate involves uh leading our Western development team active across multiple states in the region um as well as personally leading the Sunstone development effort um with support from a ton of folks some of whom are here tonight um next slide please um joined tonight by a few colleagues Nikki Olson is our senior manager of stakeholder relations at Pine gate lanaa fwom Northwest Energy lead at tetr Tech Ariel stavitsky attorney at St Reeves Jeff Fox energy consultant with Fox energy strategies and David Weiss I believe is on the phone U he's our vice president of project delivery uh whose team will be involved in actually constructing the project um once it's approved so just just to say as well um each of the folks I mentioned as well as many others inside of pine gate and and at our Consulting uh firms have uh been involved in uh the development effort and crafting the application that's been finalized and um is in front of the department now um for the next 20 minutes or so I'm going to give a very high level overview of the project and kind of highlight some of the key sections of the application and then the whole team will be available to help answer any questions at the end a bit of background on Pine gate so we're a privately held American company founded in 2016 our headquarters is in Asheville North Carolina but we're kind of spread all over the country we're actively developing in uh 30 plus States we have close to 300 full-time employees um extensive experience developing financing constructing and operating uh facilities of this type and um we have a legacy of uh success in Oregon as well with 17 operating facilities here in the state next slide so throughout the development process we've been really committed to uh being a good Community member and engaging um early and often with with a variet of different groups uh some of those are represented here on the slide um and we plan to continue those engage engagement efforts throughout the remainder of the permitting process and as we move into construction and ultimately into the operational phase as well um as I mentioned Nikki is our U stakeholder relations lead and she'd be glad to meet you if we haven't had the chance to to connect with you already so going to spend a little bit of time on this slide um and some of this may be duplicative with what Chris already covered and uh apologies for that but we'll just run through it one more time so we began developing the project back in 2021 it was previously called bombing range solar and then Echo solar and we ultimately landed on Sunstone solar which is after the the state gemstone of Oregon uh we don't plan on changing the name again um this is is a solar generation facility with potential uh battery battery energy storage component as well the maximum facility output will be 1200 megaw the largest anticipated footprint will be acres and we're going to be interconnecting the project to existing infrastructure owned by umel Electric Co Co-op and Bonville power Administration",

        "text": " two-mile setback would only apply to the two new wind turbines and not the repowered turbine so that's already included it was included in the draft proposed order uh it's included in the proposed order that's not a change this is simply a clarification and i think the you know to be consistent so i just wanted to ensure council that this is not a modification it's just a clarification thank you thank you secretary clinton yeah what i meant to also add was yeah this no changes are recommended being made to the findings within the landing section just the upfront can you are you able to see this better chair grail yes okay i would recommend a clarification sentence be made clarify that the two mile setback would apply to the two proposed two new wind and then further down after this list new with repowered as it's not the it's as it's the repowered turbines and replacement wind turbines that the two-mile setback is inapplicable not the new what what page is that on this is on page 19 of the proposed order thank you i mean yeah it's on page 20 i oh okay age 20. it could very well be on page 20. my document says unless there's additional comments or questions i can move on to the next slide already hearing them back to this overview summary of changes lastly there were administrative updates made um to the draft amended site certificate reflecting changes made to dpo conditions for this presentation to counsel the department wants to note that although a full review of applicable standards was conducted and presented in the proposed order the department concludes that the changes proposed when in rfa-6 would not result in impacts yes new or amended site certificate and that to the extent applicable previously imposed conditions would continue to minimize potential impacts under the following applicable standards and requirements listed on this slide however as i've tried to indicate in bold and underline in response to a comment made by the certificate holder the department did propose an administrative modification to the cumulative effects standard for wind energy facilities uh in the proposed order clarifying that the proposed rfa-6 modifications would include a 0.44 mile segment of new road where in the dpo it was not accurately so there was no changes made to any conditions but um that actual section was modified and that's um the same uh the cumulative effect standards for wind energy facilities there is no modifications made to any conditions there however the section itself was modified as a result of comments received on the dpl and with that the department doesn't plan on discussing these standards any further during the presentation today however if council has specific questions about these i'd be happy to discuss all right moving into our review of the proposed order i'll be reviewing the changes that were incorporated into the proposed order f-sec's council's review of the draft proposed order and comments received this slide itself provides a summary a cumulative summary of all of the changes made to that were then incorporated into the proposed order and following this slide are six additional slides broken up by that present uh really this material but just standard by standard whereas this is all of the changes and so if it's okay counsel i would like to just keep this one slide up instead of going through each standard by standard slide for my presentation but if you want additional details like for example the structural standard i call out to the oar reference standard its section number but other than really this additional detail encaptures everything so i think if it's okay i'd like to just stick to this slide instead of shifting does that work for council members i don't hear in the opposition chase so i think that's fine thank you chair you're welcome starting with the um council's structural standard which is up here the first the second at the december 17th council meeting council reviewed the dpo and recommended that the certificate holders proposed amendments to both condition 140 and 141 be modified to require the certificate holder to prior to repowering complete a foundation suitability analysis develop and implement a minimum annual inspection in monitoring scheme for the 43 re-powered wind turbines but informed further by the results of the foundation suitability analysis and then to be submitted to the department for review and approval in consultation with or a third party consultant and also established that any foundation mitigation or remediation deemed through the final turbine foundation suitability analysis be and submitted to the department to determine whether the changes require a site certificate amendment and based on council's input the department made changes or these uh these recommended changes from council were uh incorporated into amended condition 140 uh on page 40 of the proposed order now i will go if there's are there any questions on the modification the summary of the modification made to these two not hearing any i will move on to the or into the soil protection standard in summary of changes there the department received um comments from the certificate holder on recommended condition that the condition language be amended because the condition requires several additional pre-construction and construction steps necessary in agency reviews that are unnecessary for the limited repair maintenance activities required to facilitate the proposed reap power based on council's review the department described that condition 152 was intended to provide a framework for evaluating pre-disturbance soil and ensure that there are methods for evaluating and tracking successive soil reclamation neither of which are included in the certificate holders revegetation plan and noxious weed plan or are specifically a part of the 1200c council agreed um agreed that there should be a requirement for evaluating success of soil reclamation when soil impacts are represented as temporary based on council's input and recommendation the certificate holder's proposed change to condition language was not incorporated into the proposed order and for that uh by not incorporating that change condition 152 which then needed to be made like condition numbers were adjusted or anything higher than condition 152. the next condition which was a condition and the dpo became 152 in the proposed order and so it threw everything off by one so that's that moving into the land use section as just mentioned um this this summary is on condition 152 which was condition 153 originally um and so the certificate holder commented on the department's uh condition 153 152 um requesting that the condition if imposed be amended to clarify that an amended conditional use permit would only be required for components that necessitate an amendment pursuant to umatilla county development code matilda the umatilla county board of commissioners which is the appointed special advisory group for this facility commented on the department's recommended condition 153 and requested that the condition language specify that zoning permits per affected tax lot would be required for any new or modified structures based on council's review at the december 17th fsec meeting december 17 council directed the department to amend the condition as requested by the certificate holder and the sag and to clarify the conditional use permit requirement and also to specify when zoning permits would be required so that was we what's represented in the proposed order as the change to condition 152. changes were also made in the land use section to condition 153 those changes were based on comments received from special advisory group the special advisory group requested that the condition be further to specify that the construction and operational emergency response plans required to satisfy a umatilla county development code be developed by the certificate holder in coordination with energy response providers in local fire districts and that the plans specified that mutual aid agreements may be necessary and that the condition require that plans be provided to the department and umatilla county planning department now based on council's review of these comments um you know the dpo at the december council meeting it was determined that the sags comments were consistent with the scope and intent of the county code and that the condition amendments were in and that the conditioned amendments were into our into the proposed order yeah the final change in land use was a change made to condition 154 which was 155 in the dpo and that change was based on a comment from the certificate holder requesting that the condition if imposed only applied to the proposed new two new wind turbines because the proposed repowering of the 43 wind turbines and the proposed replacement of up to four wind turbines are an allowable non-conforming use which may be altered because the proposed alteration would not result in an increase in adverse impacts from the non-conformance umatilla county also commented on the department's recommended condition requested that the certificate holder be required to provide gis data to both the department and to the county to adequately evaluate compliance with the two-mile setback imatilla county uh affirmed the interpretation on inapplicability of the two-mile setback to the re-powered and replacement wind so based on council's review of those comments um council directed the department to amend this condition condition 154 as requested by the certificate holder but also include the gis data requirement per umatilla county's are there any questions on a summary of the land use before i move on to fish and wildlife go on to fish and wildlife for the fish and wildlife habitat council reviewed the dpo and um requested that the recommended condition which in the proposed order has now been renumbered and adjusted to 156. council recommended that that condition now 156 ensure that the review and approval of the final noxious weed control plan not be interpreted as to bind the department to if modification or rejection of the plan is necessary in response to these plans or to these the department amended its recommended findings of fact to clarify the intent of the review and approval process established by the condition moving on to retirement and financial the certificate holder or commented and requested on the dpo that the bonding requirement imposed by condition 157 be amended to exclude the costs of repowering and replacing the existing and rely on the existing um condition 109 for those associated costs this change would narrow the scope of the bonding requirement uh of recommended condition 157 to only the new turbines and or the battery storage approved in the final order on amendment 6. based on council's review the certificate holder's comments and of the dpo council directed staff to remove condition 157 and incorporate the proposed changes into the existing condition 109 of the consolidation and unnecessary duplication of condition requirements so condition 157 was or removed this this is cindy khan and i'm not sure who can see me go ahead cindy um thank you and i hope this is an appropriate comment um",

        "text": " and that's all we're going to work I didn't want to ask the Slater to do all three I thought you'd kill me so I thought maybe about other digital Gary and Bruce my thought is that we could we could certainly invite people from different fields and have hearings and information sessions as long as what we're doing is that we're ranking any of the best estabs in terms of work that seems to be where we have to be bought home about and ensure that you know these they all don't Peak at the same time they can put at the bottom of the bucket list for it's a successor to handle in 2050. I gave her a long time here commissioner Bob to that effect um I think it might be a good approach to to have you know set a deadline so we have maybe two months or whatever maybe to put together a kind of an outline of what what the priority is how you see it moving forward you know what that those kind of action items would be uh just and then present that as a plan that can be voted on by voting commission as something that either moves forward something that requires additional review and information you know before it moves forward and I think that there would be a sort of natural ranking of just achievable and feasible uh strategies that we can Implement and then those that maybe are more of a long range of service that we can organize within you know the next few years or however we're going to be and I'm happy to take the lead on I think you would be sure he can work with you know Commissioners you just can't remember that's available already for 35 years Mr Paul I will say I think that these these do all kind of go ahead and put these with each other as you know as things progress we'll start to find commonalities as far as you know what supports you know what supports additional solar well ultimately that that is supported by an expectation and a kind of uh you know an all the cart series of options that maybe can be selected from during the design process that encourage I've been saying that we're talking about today which you know becomes this um more open and flexible approach to requirements because at the end of the day you know we will get pushback from from developers on additional requirements but I think that there's a very strong argument to be made that at the end of the day the developers are developing property and and projects for the people in the community and so there does need to be a kind of ever increasing level of expectation that those projects are contributing to their community and and it's it becomes a yeah mutually beneficial experience so when in the process do you see bringing to your conversation receptor meeting that's a good question probably early yeah yeah I think that there's those aren't conversations that should be had at the very beginning that way you can manage expectations from not only the kind of idealists in all of us but but also that there aren't realities that need to be addressed um but it doesn't necessarily mean that just because it's getting done that way doesn't mean that's how it should be and then that goes cross-pollination between all the leaves all the three leads on the work that's you know you're driving just just sort of relates to the motion later but and then eventually this starts to work its way into regular meetings um so I just wanna give the common understandings if we if we took away the required so as I recall there was I don't know where it is but it's the Commissioners have the ability to request things on YouTube channel yeah so uh it recently relates to because we if we take a requirement that we don't we have a meeting every month off um I just want to make sure that it does mean that we can still have meetings as Commissioners and things they want to put on the objectives but my question doesn't approve that no I understood what I understand that I just wanted to make sure it's on the record and what our understanding was because when I started looking at it it occurred to me that the fact that the fact that even then even inspection we don't have things on the agenda presents an opportunity to do other things if you might not otherwise be able to do the issue this off at the time and when we know there's nothing but our ability is to request that things be put on in Canada pitch and it might not be the next meeting we know that there's something we want to put on the agenda that we know you've got time available uh we can put it on the agenda and and that way even if we aren't required it will still be um or not in any way including the ability and we may be actually creating an opportunity yeah so I mean perhaps it was a miscommunication but I certainly felt that my request to have a meeting was was not supported when we were discussing the meeting to talk about the energy and beautiful so there wasn't a meeting I had requested that we meet um I don't feel like it was um was met with much enthusiasm so give me more specifics because every time I've had a conversation with but I would just say that you know I felt that once that I had asked for uh something on the agenda and we delayed it because we didn't have a few meetings and then I ask that we meet to discuss this and that was not do we have a presentation in mind or you just wanted to have it on the agenda just to discuss the outside it was the presentation that we had here so again I just I think it's really important that we all have a clear understanding that if there is not a scheduled what is the ability of a commissioner independent of seconds and thirds and and consent that have that did you go through at least then you go through being and you go through the commissioner but then I can't I can't see foresee a reason not to have a meeting now there could have been some thought I don't know on putting that presentation along with another already scheduled public hearing that we anticipated not being lengthy so that's kind of I see that as an efficient use of Staff time rather than having two shallow meetings shallow not meeting topics but challenging time why not consolidate that into one meeting so I don't know that but my motion is not intended to preclude that opportunity for commissioner or Sam to schedule a meeting for a reason I I appreciate that and a little bit of what I heard and again this could just be my misunderstanding is that um well there isn't already something on the agenda we'll just wait until we have a meeting where there is something on the agenda that we'll add that temper to it so again because the situation where you're potentially skipping meetings I hear you we're gonna make a brother so because I mean I think it is something that we before we decided to take away the requirement meetings that we reach an understanding of what process it is or how to respond it does occur to me is in relation to this context of these priorities that if we do have these but uh like a request from the Sun committee would have some weight when it comes to a little schedule which was the part that we're on at the agenda is really good priorities and so do we have do we have confidence on those that are taking the leads on these that you have some direction and what you're going to come up with over I think Kushner hot suggestion it's a great one to kind of an outline a kind of a timeline of I anticipate doing this by this state I really think solar I would hate to see you going through a lot of information gathering but it's going to be served to us but that's maybe that's your call yeah the first session we have is on what a word to do I know that'll be a good information I mean I'm sure we'll have an updates our work yeah I just have a process question uh so if each of us are taking the lead on this is that something that you know we just kind of send an email to the entire commission to request additional members or how do we want to do that because you want them just to copy you want them that's right I'll actually go through conditions like reduce the flexibility of how you do that but it have you done it fast I mean McKinley I think two people at the time like blurted out in the meeting aggregated subcommittee and that is that there were no emails about yeah I just did it yeah maybe just that and they just did sort of it sounds like you know I mean if you were soliciting membership of commission to sure trying to do that I can do that okay I think that would be useful I just don't want to leave out so we're comfortable movement off of that topic is she good yep yes okay so okay we're moving to item 6.2 that motion to remove the language requiring the transformation to meet at least once a month I am fine putting in additional language which that would bring some comfort which does not preclude Commission convening to discuss I haven't heard that but if that's going to bring you more Comfort even though my comments are on the record of us when you want to be able to sign done in just want to go across time limiting history is to why that provision was put in in the first place probably the same reason I put in morals yeah I did check in I think it's been in there since the 60s um and the moral scene I think since like the 40s or something division was created and the code did just use the San Antonio administrator was a man throughout the years to make the whole code gender neutral and he would think that was so long ago but it was like 1999 thank you so I mean no I don't know included bad language but they did so I have a question I would say it probably because I'm sorry uh the Planning Commission um predates really having like the planning director um and so almost everything used to go through Planning Commission and so one of the reasons I can do one to me twice a month was to make sure that they were not delaying people's any support every subdivision every single thing or once at least once a month right so that you weren't delaying people's projects and then I don't think that that was ever looked at and then like we discussed maybe you forgot that it was in there for a few decades yeah so it could be we could word it similarly to the language but I think of some permissive",

        "text": " but this particular bill relates to um it relates to a biennial Energy report recommendation as you know that Oregon Department of entry and of energy puts out a robust uh report on the state of energy uh and we put that out last November and it included a recommendation for a Statewide energy strategy Washington had just gone through this process and some of the folks listening on the line if I remember correctly check rails familiar with that process um just happened a year or two ago and was kind of fresh on the mind of many people around the state and so Advocates had meanwhile kind of unrelated to our biennial Energy report worked with legislators to introduce a bill this session that would have Oregon create that Statewide energy strategy the idea really the way that I think about it is to put together all the various policies that we have around energy the data that we have the information we've already put together kind of put it all together I imagine it like a puzzle and you put the puzzle together and then you can see where there are gaps you can see where their issue that need to be resolved you can also see where puzzle pieces overlap and maybe that's not the most efficient so I'm really getting the right people together to have that conversation and figure out big picture where are we going how are we going to get there and there's been a lot of work that's relevant to that so it's not starting from scratch everything from utility irps integrated oh I'm having a moment resource thank you I was going with research the word research wouldn't get out of my brain um but anyway so we don't have to start from scratch with the research because we have the integrated resource plans already from some of our larger utilities as one example we have work product that we have we have a road map that's being released next week by the Oregon global warming commission so we have a lot of that information we need so it's just putting it together figuring out where do we go from here so that bill moved out of committee unanimously and is in ways and means now it's kind of an interesting one we think that there's Federal funding out there that could fund the work but that Federal funding won't be available until after session so the legislature will have to make a decision about funding that so we can move forward with it now or perhaps waiting doing it later if that timeline works out with Federal fund so we'll see how things come up with that though does that help and oh by the way I should add um one of the things that could come from that Statewide energy strategy is really a true up of how much energy this electricity for example the state needs to meet clean electricity goals um and that relates to citing and that could help to inform conversations about possible changes or needs within citing or renewable energy development um with a more sort of you might have heard me say earlier a solution sort of in search of a problem um and so I think it would help us to understand what problem are we trying to solve with work like what you see on this slide here and having a more clear idea of what the needs are for the state would allow for a more informed decision thank you I think this is chair Grill I think we've heard from the public more than once uh members citing what they think were the previous Governor's goals and people the whole portions of information out of different spaces so good work in one location that certainly would help our work as well as other agencies in my yes chair Grill um for the record thank you for the presentation I am just curious um given what chair Graham said about you know conversations people saying different things the testimony that was given by the department where's where would we we'd be able to see that you know groups like from a talking point okay yeah um thank you uh counselor Khan and chair Grill um if you go to there's a if you Google olis that pops up the Oregon legislative information system and you can make sure you're in 2023 it's really sometimes it likes to open to different years um and then if you put in House Bill 3179 that's where we you can look at testimony on that bill and last I saw we were kind of the only testimony on it was us and our our documents that I mentioned earlier so you can see those there we can also send links out I'm sure to the council if that works for secretary cornet but how the public access is that information is on olis that's that was going to be also um you know it is available on Olas which is you know available to anybody I will also make a note at the end of the meeting today to forward all of that to council members thank you thank you and 31.79 is the only bill that testimonies been given I mean we went out to Ola cities only 31.79 okay from us yes other people testified on other books sure thanks council member buyer sure thank just a reminder that the monthly deciding reports are so helpful and really give that little capsule view of energy development in this thing and it shows has been improved on a you know monthly basis I think that's just a great source of information and the other bit that when I see these streamlining bills and I I love the idea of improved government efficiency but boy with these processes where you want public influence you would lose that at some level five by streamlining I mean we he spent a bit of time on the public process and I can't imagine that this status of all wants to lose that but that is just me so thank you for all your efforts and um particular vitamins true girl yeah the record for the record this Perry chocolate I think it's sometime in the future we need to explore how to get the information to the to the general public on Oregon energy usage and where it actually goes I I think um from the general public that I've talked to um they want assurances that the majority of the energy that is generated in the state of Oregon is actually used by the state of Oregon and so um I I applaud any type of clarity that we can provide the general public of Oregon thank you thank you I would encourage everyone to make sure your colleagues friends family allies adversaries all are aware of the organ by a nail report it is full of so much good information I personally reference it often um I love carrying the hard copy I'm still anxiously waiting for that uh but it's got one today oh got update you can get one today that's exciting I'll check it out thank um but that information to Perry's point is you know we see things in this no secret that information is out there and so we just have to continue to let people know that they could if they really want to know they can they can find it um I think that is a natural um belief but I think sometimes we hear things and we continue to promote rumors and inaccurate information so I think it's something we can all continue to make a commitment to doing to to very suggestion all right go ahead for the record and I think about a year ago didn't we go through the binary report and show that graphic of the energy and organs yeah for the record talk councilmember Condon yeah we we showed the same key chart which is the one that I think somebody reference looked like a squid or an octopus um yes we did we did share that at a prior Council um meeting and there's a new version of that you know in in this right it was just it was tough going out for me as a council member to see how the energy and Oregon is used and generated used and how much is wasted by thanks great all right well Christy fire away keep going if you found more that's all for me I think thanks to your girl if anyone have any other comments or questions for Christy Madam chair yes uh the only comment I might make I'm not really eager to make comments uh but well I believe it's important to understand where the energy produced in Oregon where it's actually being utilized I think it's also beneficial to uh that the market-based systems that we uh have very many positives and could even have more with more coordination and kind of speaking to you from an old orientation from the Northwest power and conservation Council uh we shouldn't expect always that the energy that's being produced here is going to be utilized here in this state or that our utilities are not going to in many cases use resources from this region and even from other regions I mean it's the very nature of energy markets right now they're expected to become uh even more fluid than they already are they'll probably be more coordinated than they already are in the future and that's probably uh to the benefit of our consumers in the that one well if there are no other questions we thank you for your time we appreciate your efforts in keeping everything uh on track for the Department uh this is a long session is for folks in your position so thank you for your work thank you thank you members we'll see you soon probably at least for a wrap up I suspect uh it is time for a break if everyone would like one which I think is a splendid idea it's uh it's 10 37 so if we can take a 10 minute break that would be great if we could regroup it 10 47 I know that's awkward but we're gonna go with it uh so we'll see everyone back in 10 47. thank you thank you now 10 50 we have graciously gone over by a couple of minutes so we are ready to resume uh our meeting with the next agenda item which is the Oregon Trail solar facility with the final order on request for Amendment one of the site certificate this is an action item and we have senior signing analyst Kathleen Sloan ready to present yes sir just really quickly before um Kate begins so normally you know if we have an in-person meeting or a big agenda item we would be in person Kate was intending to be here today in person she woke up with ice all over her driveway and unable to safely leave her house so I just wanted to clarify that's why she's participated remotely today rather than in person thank you and I do know that uh staff has been great about that that seems to be that the directive that is possible so thank you we do not need anyone having an accident to to join us so um Kate um I just would remind",

        "text": " to five or more so apartment multi-family um so the only one that I can think of that would be coming is you guys recently heard the zone change for Sherwood Plaza we changed that from a retail commercial to high density residential and the ultimate goal for them is Apartments so that's the only development that at this time that I can see that they would have to apply this I don't know of any other multi-family at this time as far as any pre-ops for any additional oh sorry yeah how many of the actual stations are they going to have to provide if it's only the conduits for the 40 it's just the conduits I mean yeah right they just have to have um they have to build the capacity but it would um benefit the development to actually have at least one or two just because you know but at least um the wiring is available vastly cheaper than trying to retrofit yes yeah it doesn't add a lot really yeah it's it's it's um really smart planning whoever is developing that they just do that just because it's the requirement at this time um so let's talk about parking reform a um again all applications submitted on or after December 31st are subject to these so these are the ones that we haven't updated the Community Development code but we're applying it through the state rules directly um so we can't require more than one parking space per unit for residential that's clear and objective one one unit per one uh one parking per one unit so right now the way our code is written is that from like multi-family is based on how many numbers of bedrooms like one bedroom is one uh one parking space 1.5 you know and so on requires so many parking spaces but now one one unit it doesn't matter how many bedrooms only requires one parking space on street or off Street off Street on site yeah garage counts now that's another one right yes is that a or b that's actually a I mean you know the garage thing is B so but we have to change our code because right now we the way that our code stands is that we don't count parking garages our part as parking spaces but we can uh count so it's a little different once we implement this so but we're the codification that we're doing right now is only to be played right and it's not really uh we're not even codifying it we're just implementing it straight out of state law um but when we do the full audit it'll fix all of that and capture all of this that process is going to be one year without completion date prior to June 30. correct yep um the other is that we can't require any parking for small types of developments like small units smaller than 750 feet affordable units which we really don't regulate uh child care facilities for people with disabilities and shelters so again uh the current code doesn't require parking for adus which I would consider those small units boarding houses daycares and nursing homes and staffs considering these types of similar uses to be specialized facilities and shelters so they all fit under that and we don't currently require parking requirements for those types so yeah we're already in compliance with that so what about no it's like a big it's a big win well how has that impact our Cottage clusters well smaller than 750 our Cottage cluster of the footprint is about 950. it's so it's going to be bigger so it doesn't apply yes the max right but typically they would build it up to the maximum unless if they want a smaller Cottage that's smaller than 750 yeah I mean that's square feet I don't know if they would or not it's just an assumption yeah I think it'd be if it's under 750 if the cottage cluster unit is under 750 no no markings required it is between 750 and 950 once stall yeah all right so just can you facilities for people with disabilities I just I'm just trying to figure out it could um yeah I don't know how you're not going to let Target people who are disabled have parking spaces I mean the state law doesn't require us to but it doesn't mean okay so one of the key things the takeaway in regards to all these parking mandates is that just because we don't require it doesn't mean that the developer isn't going to propose it because you know it wouldn't benefit them if they didn't have any parking so you especially let's just prime example for an apartment complex even though we require only one unit per part one parking per one unit it doesn't mean that they're not going to provide more so that their uh can actually have a place to park or you know and typically a a one unit may have two cars I mean the developer again can provide more less so we have in our code a requirement for guest parking for 15 does that mean that that has to be removed from the code um most likely yeah and that's going to be part of the code audit yeah most likely because we can't require more we'll stop per unit yeah we can't require more what about if there's a community Center I'm going down a rabbit hole yeah people that are in the apartments right next door Park I see them when I get here early they built that whole row on the other at the edge of the city hall parking lot and they probably have one unit per one parking spot per unit and that's not all right um so one of the other things that I I over um I didn't capture the first time just because one of the requirements was parking's not required along Transit corridors that are considered frequent service routes right so TriMet has a definition of what a frequent Transit yeah what a frequent transit route and just to defend Joy that's what I mean we looked at this thing I think we all looked at it so I believe and and per our I think it's actually Metro code just to give you a little support there's Metro code that that uh defines frequent service and so we're looking at that and I think it's once every 20 minutes I that was at least what it was when I was looking at the code and so we're like well we're about we don't qualified my schedule is once every 30 minutes or so for us or we thought it didn't apply but go ahead to it yeah so I we were I was under this assumption that based on frequent Service as far as trying this definition we didn't require we were not required to do this um reform this very specific one well uh dlcd has a different definition of frequent service um uh so so now uh trimetline 94 qualifies as a frequent Transit service so here's a map that you guys also got in your packet and basically everything around the um black circle is the half mile threshold on each side of 94. um the good thing is we did our buildable land inventory over it and really there's only two big Parcels that uh can potentially develop that would be impacted significantly and the the top one there by Pacific Highway that's that Sherwood Plaza that you guys just did the zone change that's going to be apartments and then the southern one is currently vacant and is owned by Saint so um you guys would pass it if you guys go down Langer is the one with all the at certain times a month or seasonal but anyway so those are the only two and then the others are really tiny and or they're buffering some Wetlands that you can't really I can't see it extremely fully developing so the impact is minimal in regards to this but again any Redevelopment along this to offer half a mile from 94. we can't require any uh parking can we revisit that because we can get that we'll try again so the cul-de-sac that I live in to get to the bus stop because the cul-de-sac requires me to go out over around it is a mile to Old Town even though you're out of it because if it's a walkable Half Mile the all the area the cul-de-sacs and the areas in the past the fire station I would be surprised if you could you could get there in a half mile if you because of the back track yeah and I think we have a couple of options on how we measure walkable versus linear and I think it was just easier for us to just do the whole circumference it's going to be difficult for us to do a lot about that analysis it's a pretty heavy GIS analysis yeah and maybe not worth it if it's there but yeah we can consider it but it's it'd be it's pretty I just didn't know yeah I mean the good thing is there's not many lands that buildable lands that are impacted as far as future um which is great because many cities and counties that's why a lot of them have men did the Mandate of no parking all the buses pretty much of the whole city was impacted where they couldn't require any parking so why try to please meal it as far as the regulations you need to find a Transit portal no unfortunately dlcd has done that for us yeah and they Define frequent service too what is DLC would be defined Transit Corridor as well I have I I don't have the parking is not required along a Transit Corridor right so that's within half a mile of a frequent service route so Transit corridors is where the court where the bus goes yeah and typically I was also thinking that's a quarter like West Max yeah you know those are big trans those are definitely um and I also even said well we have another line that's not 94 but it's 97 yes and I go are you guys counting this also because it had it where you know it runs in the morning and it runs in the afternoon and I don't know if if they were merciful to us it's like oh you can just count 94 as that so what happens if TriMet change is well this is it trimet's frequency is what we it is invalid the frequent service definition is by Oar which is which is above and beyond and I did argue with the planner I go I really wish you guys considered the local jurisdictions frequent service Maps when considering regular service versus defining it yourself but like home rule to me right and basically they said um Point noted we can get into it after did they give like a Headway like minute is it every 30 minutes is it every yeah they did but um the whole day I think to Gene's point the only property that would be questionable would be the Saint Francis Property if you'd have to walk out",

        "text": " Seattle British Columbia the San Francisco um Bay Area all the way down into LA and San Diego so if you look at the West Coast we're still affordable whether it's the Portland region or not so those are what are some of the things that I would do when I was representing Oregon as a recruitment officer I would talk about these things and I would highlight PSU and Portland Community College in Mount Hood Community College in Oregon Tech I would represent all of um talking about the advantages now here's going to be the hard part for you I I use cons instead of negatives because I think that's a better word but Bruce knows as well as other economic developers whether they're with GPI or the City of Hillsboro we we have we are what I consider kind of been a land you guys are taking it and you're running with it which you're going to set a precedent so that everybody else can kind of learn through what the city of Sherwood is going through I can tell you right now before I left and I left business Oregon on on June 1st and went into the private sector I can tell you that over the last 24 months Oregon has not been able to submit on multiple projects communities not the state the communities and Bruce knows this and um he's one of the few that actually says Jill I don't have anything for you on this project we're not submitting on interested projects whether they're semiconductor related whether they're medals related or food and beverage there's a lot of things going on with hydrogen and other industries that aren't getting the you know their if I if a community doesn't submit we're not going to be able to compete okay for that kind of work so it's land as far as building inventory I know we have open inventory in commercial space but is it transferable to traded sector so when you have building inventory you may say yeah we've got so many 100 thousands of square feet but at the end of the day is it transferable to those industries that you want to have in your community and if you're focusing on traded sector versus back office or high tech or anything like that you you really need to pay attention to your building inventory um the con in terms of Transportation which I talked about the other day is when when the Portland region is and and I'm gonna be real honest with you guys because I know the guys in Chicago and Seattle and everything when they're saying that the commute challenges in the Portland region are as bad as Seattle we have an issue there because it's not about just moving Commerce we're moving Commerce but you know what we need to move the workforce too and I think that's where communities need to probably step up and and do a little bit more work around how are we going to put transit in place so that people can get to their jobs because companies are looking at how am I going to fill my Workforce needs okay and then um funding for infrastructure I'll be honest with you guys I think there's funding obviously there's a lot of federal dollars that are flowing into the states it's important for jurisdictions to know what's coming in and how to access it whether it's Broadband whether it's water Wastewater um this is this would be a good opportunity to sit down with the leadership of business Oregon and find out how those dollars are flowing and what they look like every State's managing their their Federal flow of funding you know it started at the beginning of covet it's still going on right now with chips with Broadband but one of the things that came out of some testimony for the semiconductor work task force and I I sat in and I I listened to them you know I I get bored at night so I listen to testimony and legislature but one of the things that they said was we have plenty of industrial land what we don't have is the funding to serve it somehow we have to connect those dots okay if I'm a side selector and I'm bringing you a project and it's going to take 18 months and let me tell you something I'm really happy for Sherwood for where they're going but you guys you know it's gonna be another year before we really know how you guys are going to pull the trigger on on more opportunities because you have to go through this process so I applaud you for it but at the same time get as as prepared as possible um for it and then lastly I'm gonna you know homelessness let's just it is what it is every jurisdiction has to manage it the problem is is and I'm going to say this I used to be the RDO the regional development officer for business Oregon out in in eastern Oregon so I covered five counties out in eastern Oregon we always knew that if Portland is unhealthy the rest of the state isn't healthy so let's let's all get that helping us there because it's a perception issue it may not be a reality for the theater sure would it may not be a reality for Hillsboro OR North Plains or others but the perception is there and I've had to listen to that perception for years ever since covet hit so we just need to support each other I don't have the the answer or I don't even know how to address it to be quite honest so I'm watching you know with uh a lot of patients as leadership in some of our jurisdictions are dealing with that but it is it is what it is when when a site selector says Jill pick me up at the airport but let's not go down 205 or I5 I'm saying I'm trying to go okay how do I get to Woodburn without going on 205 and you know trying to pick secured as routes are a little bit challenging because the site selector didn't want the company representatives to see some of the things that are there everybody's dealing with it I don't care what jurisdiction it is in which state but just so you know um those are kind of some of the things the other thing um based on a conversation we had a couple days ago and I will be quiet is 50 to 100 Acre sites there's only three in the Portland region that's not and you're going to miss opportunities so if I'm going to say any harsh words I'm going to tell you 50 to 100 Acre sites not having a dozen or more available is in my opinion as somebody who now represents the other side of the table is is just not acceptable so I'll stop and stay on as you guys ask questions and you can move forward on yours thank you thanks so much I appreciate that I just want to make one one statement from the semiconductor task force report it says in the aggregate the Metro region shows thousands of Acres designated for industrial property over the next 20 years however a closer look at this land shows very very few sites that are appropriate size and are development ready and suitable for manufacturing and this applies not just to semiconductor the current question is how are we going to be how are we going to be successful in Economic Development compared or aspirational peers Salt Lake and Denver and Phoenix and Nashville and Charlotte these are very proactive regions and and this is not just a semiconductor industry it applies as Oregon manufacturing Council tells us it applies to all types of manufacturing we need various Tools in addition to to land Supply we need tools such as industrial infrastructure financing land aggregation tools talent and Workforce Development competitiveness incentives and tax tax environment and Regulatory certainty so Washington county is really the key to the future of this region in many cases and and there's a need for collaboration for Washington County to be economically successful I'm going to turn this over now to uh to the mayor and Keith to talk about our Economic Development focus in Sherwood yeah thank you Bruce I'll kick us off I mean what what are we I have as a city council this really has aspirational Economic Development goals to use the old proverb we're planting trees today for future generations to to be able to enjoy and and trying to really have a forward thinking and and proactive approach to how we're doing Economic Development also we understand that the long-term health and for our community is to find a better diversity whether housing and our our jobs balance so that we can we can have a good diverse tax base going forward in the future and and what we're seeing with boots on the ground is that there is there is currently a strong strong demand for industrial and advanced manufacturing uh spaces we're seeing a really low vacancy rate currently at 2.6 percent which is effectively meaning that there is no space and we're seeing that in our our Industrial Area Industrial sites are being leased before they're even completed um we're seeing that the demand is high and and really the developers are picking and choosing you know who is the best tenants for what they what they want which really shows us it's not anecdotal this is real world type situations that we're dealing with we also know that we're running out of viable industrial land over the next five or six years and so if we're really thinking long-term and aspirational we really need to think how we're going to be competitive how we're going to remain with those other cities other areas other regions that are really aggressive in what they're doing um and we see potentially you know as we look at Sherwood West as as a tech Innovation Park is potentially part of that design and plan but again it'll be a while before we know where we're going to go and where we're going to land on that and with that I'd like to show over the mayor just talk about what next steps would be and what what he would like to see kind of our next steps for this group might be frozen there I don't know if what was that me because the mirror is frozen can you hear me now yeah yes about that I couldn't find my little uh mute button um no thanks uh thanks folks for the presentation that was amazing as usual and I appreciate all the work you guys put into it so yeah so for next steps I mean we're really talking about the urban growth boundary report and how you know Sherwood's been thinking a lot about how we can support metro in their efforts to put out a quality report um you know and one of the things I always I've been talking a lot about lately is is the report needs to be more than just here's a forecast we talked about this earlier and I think the pre 2018 report talked about this it really needs to be more aspirational and talk about okay to what are what are our goals in the region and and how do we achieve those",

        "text": "cor Bon just just a quick clarification so for transmission lines we're defaulting to the Wildfire m ation plan developed for the Pu which makes a lot of sense to me and and then um with the uh RFA 2 is there any language there that says that this plan will now include the new site boundary um microid area do we have to make that explicit or we've said do this as part of site to say and by the way that extra stuff you just added is you mean a change to the condition or just in the order um I don't think you need to I don't know if we need to change I don't think you need to change it because in the while in their Wildfire mid right your like our analysis area goes out a you know a half mile I think right we've already approved that right we've already this yeah and then their evaluation and their plan also has this buffer which would be covered in would overlap with your analysis area so I don't I don't think that we would need to change anything but that's a good question thanks chair how yes councelor Imes um thank you for bringing this up today and talking more about it um I would like to see um I know that the 2024 should be coming out in any time um I would imagine going OPC and then it would be filed with us at that time correct and um was your was the so was the order in our review of this amendment yes okay um right so this one is part of RFA to to demonstrate continued compliance with the standard okay all right and then um I guess I'm also wondering about compliance capacity but it seems like um you know the the Public Utility Commission is going to have quite a bit of an impact on compliance as well but I'm talking more about like the capacity for um the sighting Division and like once this is actually comes you know to fruition um have you guys thought about what that really looks like for this department and if there would be any needed Staffing for that or not just a out of curiosity yeah no I think it's it's really uh it's it's a really good point and thank you for thinking about our staffing I know I know uh secretary kette thinks about it all the time same thing as senior policy adviser uh esterson um it's interesting because we do have a lot of we have a lot of facilities we have a lot right but not every facility gets built but we are the we're kind of thinking that we're going to have kind of this big push of construction of a lot of facilities and I'm sure as um um Sarah esterson has mentioned we have Haley Aldridge um our consultant on board helping with compliance you you've met ashh Woods our new compliance officer like we're building out our compliance program that said you know construction is the big right it's the push it's the it's real impactful um kind of all over and it's the it's a big draw on resources that's not to say that operation doesn't there's not like oper there's a lot of operational work a lot of it is reporting and the and like the site visits but really when you once you get into Opera it is a drop down as far as like pulling our and that's when it really kind of goes over into the compliance program and reviewing the annual reports or any incident reports and scheduling the on-site stuff so to me as far as like it's more manageable because we can schedule it out I don't know if secretary KET wants to add anything on that um but except that we are being mindful of our our staffing and trying yeah staff up to accommodate all of our this is an opportunity to talk about it because again they are expanding here right at the end of the day this is an expansion yeah I mean in terms of RFA 2 I mean it doesn't it's not an expansion the facility is already approved so this may change the give them the opportunity to expand well but I mean it's still going to be you know a 300 mile long line and multiple route Alternatives at the end if it gets a if it gets constructed it'll be constructed 300 M it'll be the same beginning point and end point so RFA 1 didn't really change that RFA 2 didn't really change that it didn't you know they're not going to build all of the alternative so I mean your your point is absolutely valid do we have the right compliance Staffing for the foreseeable future to meet all of our ongoing compliance needs you know the answer is we're constantly looking at that so you know as Kellen brought up all the things we have right now we currently have within the proposed budget for next starting next fiscal year another compliance officer so you know we have two full-time compliance officers this would give us a third um we have another vacant um senior sighting analyst position we are looking to fill that which may include some more enhanced compliance responsibilities in addition to the applications and amendments the difficulty with Staffing is we have to match our fees to the Staffing we can't have a bunch of staff that we don't have the fees to cover so that makes it difficult you know you sort of overlay a couple of different things and I've talked about this before which is what's the what's the foreseeable work that we have in terms of applications and amendments and uh compliance you know and that as Kell said some facilities never go into construction um so we have to be kind of looking out in the future and thinking what's that going to be and you know do we have the right Staffing and do we have the justification to have the Staffing associated with the fees because most of the coverage of the sighting division is covered by fees so it's always a complex thing for us to be looking in the future and then dealing with the bial budget cycle that the state has so we are constantly looking at that and and luckily we do have some ability with our consultant to um to be able to rely upon them to fill in some of the gaps when we need that so it's a good question we're always looking at that and you know we're always trying to match those two things into the future what our funding is and what our staffing needs are I think that you know you've been saying this over and over throughout your presentation and that there's many things that come together at once and you end up learning from this and cleaning you know and that's I feel like kind of one of these the point I'm trying to make is that um the cumulative effect and how what it really looks like is it so I think it's just a good discussion to keep having suggesting any kind of major yeah uh condition or anything about that but it's just it keeps coming to my mind every time I read these you know um it's just that much more workload really so but and that's exactly why you know we spent a lot more time recently on the compliance program because as new facilities get approved that means the very likelihood that we're going to have more projects get constructed or go into preconstruction go into Construction be an operation you know and we need to have the Staffing to be able to to reasonably evaluate all of those um time frames associated with you know the life cycle of a facility so is a good question and and we are constantly looking at that yeah perfect and I look forward to seeing the 2024 um and I know they do I'm sure you know Public Utility Commission does a very thorough very very thorough um while for mitigation plan so that's I'm eager to to see absolutely that um it's really kind of it's kind of fun to read their staff reports right because they're like like us right but different and so it's just interesting to kind of do read their to look at how they kind of do functionally very similar but totally different from what we do um which is also one of those things they do have an independent contractor that helps their review which again is really interesting to read the staff report because they also often disagree with that you know it's just it's it's it's fun because I'm like you guys are dorks too I like it so that said about the so what we have on the record now and the record's closed is 2023 that's the last approved one 2024 is in this cycle but so say there was never another again okay it's fine but the rules apply to everybody and you can exercise the rules no um okay so totally just joking okay keeping it Lively here we're almost done guys we're doing great um so say this was the last Amendment and Council ends up approving it the condition we have a condition we have a construction plan W fire plan and then we have our operation wfire mitigation plan that basically says before you start construction give us the last one and then every year in operation give us your Mo most updated one so it's possible that we would have uh a a gap depending on when they did compliance with that condition that said we can go on we can we can go on and pull pull it and look at it you know um but it might be depending on when they go into comply with that condition um if it happens in 20 well if it happens in 2025 they would probably be giving 2024 if it happens in 2026 then they would probably be giving 20 25 so just you know okay thank you don't thank you I just I know this is important so I wanted to take some time to talk about it okay so um does c because I'm moving on to the next steps um and we're you know I slated two hours for this presentation but we can take the time because there was a lot of comments so was there anything that was on your mind or on your list to talk about that we didn't talk about councelor Byer thank you chair how um we got comments from I believe the Union County Department a very specific list of asks but it seemed to be um very thoughtful in dealing with both the construction phase and the operational phase and I'm just wondering if and I think would that be in the public Public Works standard it was dealing with all the new um or changed roads and the road width changes to deal with slope stability but um it seemed to me that there were some useful things about road maintenance that may be not necessarily addressed in this project but to keep in mind as we look at other projects to make sure in our conditions",

        "text": " the the main takeaways from that uh John did you have anything that you wanted to add hi uh good morning everyone um no I think that's a that's a great summary I mean this is pretty Stark uh um you know differentiation between groundbased systems and and you know roof mounted um one thing we are asking our consultants for is uh to extend the study out just a little bit to include the the former Herz property that we did not own when this study was undertaken so um assumption being of course that roof mounted and and covered parking over there would would be the same so um uh hopefully we'll have a scope and a fee for that here this week and um yeah other than that I don't think I have too much more to add um from a sort of a business perspective I like the idea of covered parking with solar panels I know I've seen a lot of other reports with those um because not only does it provide the the climate impact and the ability to uh offset our energy use uh which is a cost savings but it also then provides a customer service piece you know where people can park undercover uh out of the rain and out of the Sun so um kind of a a win-win there but um other than that yeah I don't think I have too much more to add this is certainly not my area of expertise so thank you Juliana for helping helping me pedal through all of this and thank you for the committee to the committee for those of you that um help get the funding for this is really important um I just I wanted to say I mean I agree with what you're looking at here basically looking at the simple payback period with the years uh I guess some of my concerns were it was the roof arrays and the carport arrays that had biggest issues with glare but it looked like maybe they could be addressing those so I think that there is a new tower John please correct me I'm not Tower is moving the federal government is moving our Tower probably to the other side of the airport so glare where our terminal is is much less of an issue for the tower right yeah I think the broad answer to that is once the air traffic control Towers move to the east side of the airport all the existing glare issues will solve themselves and that's not identified in the report because again it wasn't a known quantity at that point sure that makes that makes sense but how far ahead in the future is that it's actually coming up it's in yeah I would say in the next two to five years likely um it's part of the bipartisan infrastructure law funding and and all of that funding is required to be spent by 2030 so and we're already into the uh environmental analysis on the on the parcel on the east side of the airport between the National Guard and Garmin so we're we're moving along at pretty quick Pace I would guess in the next two to five years we'll have a a new tower up okay uh the federal incentive is that where's that coming from is it grants or is it from the infrastructure I think that that one is um part of the irs's direct aay program so um IRS typically you couldn't as a government entity you don't pay taxes so you normally couldn't get those benefits so IRS created direct pay which is the ability to directly pay government entities for um their efforts like uh solar panels and okay we have solar panels on the new police St yes um they actually asked me to get that information to the Consultants help them get that we have been a variety of places okay okay thank you I guess um I just one other question is does it make sense to make parking better I mean are we undermining are we doing a good thing with having more solar but yet incentivizing more people to drive the airport like I'm wondering so what's the current alternative is it R share because then that would be two trips as opposed to one two trips each way as opposed to one well currently most people do people because our our airport is so convenient and Cally located we're not seeing much parking and so people are just getting dropped off because it's you know basically 15 minutes from anywhere in town to our and so we're getting we're seeing very little parking Revenue because of that so it's not even ride share necessarily I I think it's just family and friend um but so I'm wondering I don't know I just I just tossed that question it just seems counter other efforts not that I'm opposed to Sol because I'm absolutely not course I don't know I just it's good question I mean I do think people are getting dropped off up well I think is the airport expands services and will attract more people people from outside the area that'll make a difference I mean people that at train station for example because of the convenience it has um there might be more people there I think that's a great Point counselor and I also think that there's an an opportunity down the road when we have um a need for increased parking that that covered parking then could be offered at a premium rate uh and so then covered you know more distant from the terminal would be maybe an economy lot as opposed to a a short-term you know premium parking lot yeah I think that a future without any cars is very hard to imagine I think um I'm with you where I'm trying to figure out the I mean we have something tonight on our agenda and Council that's hard for me right because we're trying to you have all these competing things happening but um I think yeah I think it's something that um actually the climate lens would actually help us get through something like this and kind of get to the bottom of it um but I also think that as the climate intensifies in its extremes I'm having covered areas for people might actually be needed and if we do have them that it is creating energy um again right I mean it's it's all hard yeah it was just a thought in my mind wanted to pass out but I like the idea that John your suggestion about the premium parking um that sort of thing I know that's popular in Arizona if you can get your car under also in places with giant hail if you go to you go to really bad with the big you know because people will go on flight come back in their car will be destroyed when they have those giant Health firms I had a question about this kind of solar on our um city owned garages we don't have roofs I know we don't have roofs or coverage right now well I'm just saying like if we put a carboard type thing on a on a city-owned parking garage would it work to do over there the only like thing that adds some complexity is you have to check and see if it's structurally is structural Integrity is enough to support that additional weight I guess we could just not have Pary up there and just make it roof or cover parking and then everybody would have cover parking sorry we just people the park thanks everyone I've got the fa waiting on the other line so I'm gon to go ahead and log off thanks so much thanks John all right update on eecbg and municial energy master plan are Fe a lot of letters but not a lot of words uh EBG Energy Efficiency conservation block crant and then um the energy master plan we had an RFP that went out we were unsuccessful on that one and we tried to have a large economies of scale thinking that if we just did the go of the whole city that we would get some um you know some price reduction in that but unfortunately that didn't have a price reduction and it also didn't have the expertise required so instead of trying to shoehorn those proposals into what we were looking for we decided to um look it at it from part A and Part B part A being uh buildings and Parks or things that are in the general fund and Part B being um Municipal operations for uh portable water Wastewater and transportation signals and street light and that could be done through utility funds whereas the part A to be done through this brand so that is currently what we're thinking and we have it under review with World Resource Institute and um Energy Trust of Oregon so hopefully they can provide any additional feedback that might make this this round of RFP a little bit more successful any questions or comments on that thank you on to Energy savings Contracting so if you look um past the minutes on your agenda they have uh provided us a little back sheet the US Department of energy is asking if we are interested in being um a partner or a sponsored Organization for this program where they are trying to get 1 billion in measured and verified savings uh by 2030 and I gave a graas here because I am not good at explaining it without it so what Energy savings performance Contracting is is they do technical audits of your building portfolios and that gives the Baseline energy cost and then there is a private company or an Esco that comes in and pays for those upgrades to make it more energy efficient so you have in that in that green the dark green and the light green those are your cost savings from that energy efficient upgrade and then from that you pay with that darker shaded green and sorry wasn't the best graphic the slightly darker shaded green is what you'd pay back that company that UPF front paid for those upgrad and then at the end of that contract you would take back over the operation and maintenance you would during that contract you would receive a portion of the Energy savings and at the end of it you receive full Energy savings minus whatever it costs for operation that's the part I'm confused by what do you mean by we would take back the operation cost of what of whatever upgrades they did so normally they do like a portfolio of upgrades of both small short paybacks like LED lights and big long paybacks like furnaces they look at your building portfolio they figure out what you can improve the Energy Efficiency of they pay for that they get those upgrades and then you pay a portion back to them from those Energy savings is there a front cost no what's the downside it requires so the I guess there's an upfront cost in it you do have to do technical Audits and those are expensive but that sometimes can be looped into your contract um but it is just the administration of it uh you are looking at measured and verified savings so you have to have uh programs where you can",

        "text": " a moment so what we have included in the staff report is 179,000 for the first year of abatement so multiply that by a factor of 10 and we're also looking at so what we're like 1.7 million at that point okay 1.8 okay and you know the reason I mention it is because you know we we definitely have received some written testimony and comments online that how can the city afford to be giving tax breaks right now given our financial strain you now how how would you respond to that I mean it's I know it's property tax exemptions and not asking you to provide a political opinion or anything but how I'm sure this isn't the first time you've gotten this reaction and testimony so the answer to that question is that this abatement has zero impact to the city's general fund mhm so if we did not provide this exemption it doesn't help our general fund situation at all because this property is located within an urban renewal area so it's the urban renewal area that would foro the receipt of that tax revenue and how much money do we have sitting in that urban renewal area approximately right now we collect around $7 million a year in tax increment a little over 7 million so we're not currently hurting for urra dollars to invest back into this part of town we are not no okay all right thank you I think that's really helpful um you know the only other you know questions I have we heard a lot of concern testimony from people who came down here tonight and I know you provided us with I believe an email talking about some wage issues at the was it at the subcontractor level is that what you guys found can you speak yes so I spent a couple of hours talking with representatives from the carpenters union and watching in the videos that I believe the mayor and counselor Stapleton were also viewing today and the the issues that they were raising and highlighting in the videos were not at the subcontractor level it was below that so it's labor Brokers um providing employees kind of down below the subcontractor level and from the information that that um was shared with me um the claims are that these labor Brokers are providing employees on many many many jobs construction jobs around the state and not just in the state you know throughout the west coast and so their recommendations were to um either enact kind of transparency ordines at the local level ordinances at the local level or to um add requirement that you know at upon building permit or in at other times through that process process uh where the contractors would have to who can of Follow That chain of um of employment so whether it's who's working directly for subcontractors or who is working for labor Brokers that those entities are identified thank you and I do have a couple more Mr Mayor so uh Mr Mayor commented earlier on working with Deacon or whomever the Builder is can we just create a list so that we have more transparency about the contractors the subcontractors the Hees and others who are the the level below the subcontractors would it create a burden for the city to maintain that list or to request that list from projects like this I would say that requesting it and receiving it keeping that on file would not be overly burdensome if it were increase to um actually going out to site conducting interviews um doing any sort of monitoring then we start looking at impacts and I'm just curious because construction is certainly not my realm of expertise I don't know if cities currently do that level of do they do a randomized inspection or interviews is there a precedent for that in similarly situated cities in Oregon uh the of my knowledge only on prevailing wage projects so when we have our federal funds you know in a project or if it's a Housing Authority project something along those lines then we do go out we look at certified payrolls we do um wage interviews with folks out on job sites okay and at this point do you feel that the there are lots of allegations of wage theft do you feel that those concerns have been resolved is there an investigation ongoing with Buy I I mean what is the status of that yeah so um the representatives from the the um Carpenters Union did share some cases that had been turned into bully um where there are investigations underway you know bu is very understaffed for conducting these sorts of Investigations I'm not aware that bully claims were filed on prior Deacon projects within the city um or on other projects within the city so I I don't have that level of um that is the the appropriate Avenue is to start with bully claims and going through the entities that already exist in the state to monitor this kind of behavior and uh a number of people testified about there are reporting mechanisms in place they're designed to protect workers uh my expectation is this is not a project but I would assume that any time we're working with any developer whether it's Deacon or anyone that we expect all of our developers to follow the letter of the law to you know work with workers to support allegations being taken to the appropriate authorities is there anything that we the city do to make sure the developers know that we believe wage theft is unacceptable we expect you to follow all the labor laws what kind of assur what kind of what are what kind of message are we sending to developers when projects like this happen so when it comes to fully private sector where we don't have any federal funds involved we don't have any notices like um you know advisories about department or anything like that right on federal projects we do so there's a whole slew of of requirements that go along with with those but when it comes to urban renewal incentives or tax exemptions we don't have those kinds of re requirements in place because we follow state law and state law doesn't have those requirements I mean now that we know that these allegations are being pursued and obviously we have no idea what bully will do with them or how long takes them it does take them months at a time usually per case are you comfortable moving forward with this project I am yes yeah thank you thank you counselor and I do have a an amendment to a potential motion uh it's I didn't go into all the detail with Mr Deacon but it's along those lines and it was in consultation with the carpenters union and the idea is to try to shed some light on this issue to try to prevent these things from happening in the future where where we have to have a we require a list of contractors subcontractors Subs subcontractors and all of the folks so that and and we're requiring them to provide that to the city so they would be subject to public records request so other people if they're interested um could could look at those lists to try to uh if they wanted to look for patterns of behavior or certain things like that that basically this would just be shining light on this issue to try to prevent Bad actors from being in our city and so this would in my mind this is a a really good first step um and according to Mr what I heard Mr Deacon to say he would this would work for him as well so I don't think it would prevent the project from going forward yet it would give us the start of some guard rails to try to prevent that that was my goal uh in in crafting this uh um this amendment and I apologize that you're you're all going to hear a very lengthy Amendment but there was and I couldn't get it out ahead of time because I literally had about two and a half or three hours to come up with this so so that's thank you you you bet councelor vanney thank you um my question is for director refer board I first of all I wanted to say Christ thank you so much for all your patience the last few weeks um and all the answers to so many questions I have learned so much about property taxes and uras and also U Mr L Allen's um document was really helpful my question is more of a clarification um the tax exemption only applies to the improvements on the property right um I guess what I'm saying is the owner still pays taxes on the value of the land right that's correct okay I just wanted to clarify that thank you thank you counselor counselor Stapleton thank you um my question director is we've talked a little bit about these transparency ordinances and how easy would that be to um investigate that and see if we can't include that in future mtip application processes so the Carpenters Union did provide me with a couple of different options that have been enacted in cities in California um we could certainly take a look at that and see what impact that would have um you know there are there are considerations in terms of um you know the complexity and the sort of monitoring that would be required so something like the mayor has proposed that is a kind of a notification or reporting you know so that it's available and would be subject to public records request is something that on the staff Administration site is not going to be too burdensome um ordinances that would require any sort of Investigation monitoring then that's going to have some definite staff impacts and administrative costs that go along with it so I'm very happy to look at the ordinances and see if there is something in terms of um just sort of a notification kind of requirement uh and just and information sharing about who subcontractors and and as you go through the chain of employers on a construction project um to see if that would be appropriate without adding a lot of cost okay yeah that would be something I would be very interested in in looking at moving forward with um after we uh get through this uh particular um project that we have before us um I also wanted to just um State there was some comments about our our local contractors really um you know being opposed to any kind of wage theft or any kind of illegal um work that's happening um and I think that uh the intent of the union and I think the intent of uh the mayor's motion is to affirm that uh we we do affirm that and I think we are all in agreement there um I think that when we make I want to be really careful when we say there's a reporting you know mechanism or or um Avenue that that folks have access to because I don't think that that really takes into consideration the complexities of everyone's situation when they're on a job site or when they're working here",

        "text": " don't know if um this is a one-time thing right like a one-time donation or whatnot for these projects and um in moral County was pretty specific in their comments about advising that a some kind of committee be formed or oversight uh regarding this because it there could be a potential uh more funding that is added to these types of you know um research um and development as far as agriculture goes um so I'm just trying to really um look at the at moral County's comments and and be you know if I can support their request at all I would um I would I would definitely like to do that and that that way you know there's if if Morrow County has a concern about these funds coming in and then not being distributed like they're supposed to be or they say they're going to be and there's no oversight for that that's kind of the the how I interpreted it so well we can certainly look at that and make sure that the you know money that's you know being proposed as part of their um the economic value as a part of the reasons justification um is clear and tied well to the projects um that we can absolutely do but you know the it's the applicant who's proposed the projects the funding so if there's additional funding that comes in it wouldn't be within the parameters of the site certificate if a site certificate is issued which includes those conditions so that wouldn't be anything than oh if if if they have a side agreement between the the applicant and moral County in the future outside of the FC process you we wouldn't have a role in there anyway so we're really within the confines of what is proposed by the applicant you know does it help justify the reasons exception and then we really can't put in beyond that you know say well we don't think 500,000 is enough you need to put in you know more than that an additional project suggesting that at all right I'm not suggesting that at all want to make that clear sure but but certainly I think you know your question is valid are the you know is it tight enough in there about you know what the money is and where it's going to be included and again if if we believe that that justifies you know as part of the reasons exception then we want to make sure that the that money goes to the projects which are you know essentially being designed for that reason so we we absolutely will look into that well and if I could point out that since the last month's meeting uh in case I don't know if you have it your slide deck or not the the staff is recommending a revision to the conditions I think yeah Chase references it right here yeah the very last bullet land use conditions 14 and 15 and I'm gonna I'm gonna attempt to drag a my my draft of the proposed order over and let me know if you can see see this let's see yeah we can see it Chase okay so here we go so this is this is our our first go at uh um amending like a recommended amend amendment to these conditions which which uh is in response to the applicant's representation of what they would be paying and we um these recommended changes to these conditions would um I it would it would clarify further where the funds are to be used you know we're we're calling out what they represented and now actually just putting it into the condition and here um same thing like we had the North Lexington grain elevator but we want the our proposed change is um for the certificate holder to to demonstrate that the funds were used not will be used but I guess like this 14 um this is more what we're talking about where it's clarification to specific specific pieces of equipment Chase um do you are you familiar with those comments from Morrow County that I been speaking about um regarding this committee that they'd like to see maybe that's that's a local you know that's the up to the local government to do and outside of our perview but I just want to make sure and mention it on the here I will certainly um re-review their moral County comments okay also just to clarify the agricultural impacts you guys had determined already didn't meet um standard and the analysis for the agricultural um piece is was anal was the analysis was conducted by nextera's consultant e e yes yes minimal impacts to agricultural analysis was conducted by their consultant yes okay I find that interesting I still kind of have an issue with that because I didn't realize that they were in the agricultural business meaning um that they were qualified to quantify the loss of you know exclusive Farm use that's going to be taken up and and the and the you know all the dollar I was just surprised to learn that so well their analysis was on the indirect impacts to um agriculture as a result of the project not the direct impacts so the you know the physical occupation was not part of their analysis as I recall it was what does the physical occupation of the facility have on adjacent surrounding lands and then how can we quantify that and then put a per dollar you know per acreage dollar amount um to that I think that was their analysis and they're you know they're you know Economist um they do many different things so so um again you know you can look at that you can decide whether you agree with it or not um but you know that was their analysis any other comments or questions on the reasons exception discussion here okay uh um moving on to my last um we're moving into noise um noise requirements um so operational noise from the proposed facility was evaluated um to the maximum amount maximum allowable noise limits there were uh um 33 noise sensitive receptors identified in the applicant's uh noise modeling and evaluation and in the noise modeling like results of the noise modeling showed that the current facility layout would exceed the maximum allowable standard of 55 DB at seven of the 33 nsrs during the daytime and at of the 33 nsrs uh during the nighttime and the nighttime maximum allowable standard is 50 DB um so in the in the DPO therefore in the DPO the department recommended that Council find that the facility as currently um proposed wouldn't comply with the requirements um the noise standard requirements without additional iation um and that additional mitigation uh could include but wasn't to changes in the final facility design and also in the draft proposed order as recommended noise control condition one here I only have uh sub Part B or sub subc but the entire um noise control condition one would require additional preconstruction analysis to demonstrate that um the facility by phase would um would uh meet the ambient noise degradation standard um and wouldn't exceed the maximum allowable noise standard um and now here what I have on the screen is subc of our recommended condition and in the proposed order the department recommends uh provision the provisions four and six that are referenced in subc be removed um and we're recommending this Minor scrier error revision because those actual Provisions in that rule apply specifically to a Wind Facility and as this is in a Wind Facility it's not needed like that specificity isn't needed but the rule if we stopped it as represented here at three would continue to apply to solar um into this facility and it would still have to meet these um I think one last thing I'd like to mention is later on in today's council meeting as agenda item F our rule making coordinator Mr Tom um is going to be um the solar noise ru making and that roller noise rule making would if if approved I guess would allow for noise waivers to be utilized at solar facilities not just at wind facilities um in order for a facility to meet the ambient noise degradation standard and so that's just like uh a fun um extra bit of information about an agenda item later today um but it's applicable here like our current condition will like they can't construct a facility that doesn't meet the standard that's what our recommendation is or our condition is is is um requiring um and so really only recommended change for noise is this minor Scribner um with that I don't have anything else is there any additional topics questions comments that um Council would like to to bring up I hand it over to you uh chair how or secretary cornette take it from here I'm not seeing any hands up um interest it looks like from any of the council members wanting to continue further discussion or have any additional questions am I missing anybody speak up if you do have a question or okay well thank you very much I really appreciate everyone time yep all right on to the next okay let me get my act together here you have a hand up oh oh um Vice chair Condon yeah sorry uh to be late on the draw there uh I just want to one compliment uh Chase on the presentation and really counsel for the discussion last month um which was not as interesting to view and not be a part of but it was certainly informative and the extension to today because I think today's um discussion was certainly useful to me and I hope um others so um job and thank yeah I'll Echo that too uh good um at this point um we could take a break if people need to or we could go on to public comment what's the preference of the council maybe just a short break okay thank you Katie I agree AG too okay so let's see it's U 9:57 let's just call it uh 10 and we'll be back at U what five or 10 after 10 I'll say 10 101 will return thank you you bet back and um it's now 10:10 um and I'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue on with the next agenda item which is the public comment period um the times reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment items closed for comment include the Boardman to him andway transmission line request for Amendment two draft proposed order and the wagon trail solar project draft proposed order in the agenda we've set the amount of time for individual commenters at uh seven minutes I guess let's uh see um many Nancy if you could uh check the webinar and the phones to see if anyone's interested in commenting we can get a number of how many people are interested and kind of adjust the time thank you chair how let's go ahead and just remind everybody how to uh raise their hand in the webinar so um at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons you you click on the participant in the bottom of that participant window",

incorporated for van sickle two which are both subsidiaries of nextera energy resources but this the facility is located in umatilla county entirely on private land north and east of the city of helix as far as procedural history is concerned the approved facility on uh on may 17 2019 council approved a fifth amended site certificate which authorized the certificate holder to repower existing wind turbine blades in the for being for the operating bansicle 2 unit and the certificate holder must initiate by 2022 let's go on to what the request for amendment 6 is requesting and seeking on july 12 2021 the department received a preliminary request for amendment 6 to the state line win project facility site and the preliminary request for requests changes uh requests two primary changes the first is to add 50 megawatts of battery storage on approximately 11 acres and the second is to amend the approved turbine specifications including megawatt output number of turbines and associated improvements of the van cycle 2 unit in consideration of the approved repowering from amendment five and there's three options proposed in request for a minute six for this uh turken specifications option one is to repower all existing turbines from 2.3 to 2.66 megawatts and to do so each turbine would would be increased from a total height of 440 feet 489 feet and the above ground blade tip clearance would be reduced from 85 feet down to 59 and these um total total height and above ground blade tip clearance are both respectively the tallest and closest of all options provided so that the 489 feet is the tallest of all three options whereas the 59 feet would be the least amount of blade tip clearance of the three options i propose um option two would would be to replace three turbines and changing them from 2.3 megawatts to 2.32 megawatts and that would increase the total turbine height from 440 feet to 452 feet and it would reduce the minimum ground blade tip clearance from 85 feet to 72 and the remaining 40 turbines would be repowered consistent with option and lastly option three as proposed would add two additional turbines consistent with option one as well as converting one existing turbine from two point from a 2.3 megawatt turbine to a 2.32 megawatt turbine and that would increase much like option number two the total height from 440 feet to 452 and reduce the minimum ground blade tip clearance from 85 feet to 72 feet and the remaining turbines with option three would we would be re-powered with uh re-powered consistent with the turbine specifications of option number one in short option one lays out the the turbine specifications and total height of 489 option two would and that would replace all or repower option one would repair all of the turbines option two would uh re-power 40 of them with with the option one specifications and then re-power uh three um height and option three would actually add two turbines consistent with option one 42 of them would be would also be repowered consistent with option one and one would be minimally repowered to the specifications of option two and we did receive a type b review request with this facility and here is a figure location project location as mentioned the state line wind project isn't is located entirely in umatilla and entirely on private land and is located both north and east of the city of helix and it's just south of the oregon washington state line border and with that i conclude my project but um if i definitely welcome any questions if there are any questions by council and i did i does anyone have any chair grill chase i've got a question so with the request with the request for um and the three options so is the department are you evaluating all of the different options what what's the applicant asking for a really a review of all of the an approval no matter what they choose or does the department uh determine which is best second and third no we would be reviewing all three um making findings on all three yeah all right thank you andrew this is hanley um go ahead nelly chase where would the battery storage be didn't you say there was going to be 50 megawatts of battery storage added yes and the battery storage let me see if i can do this there's a good figure battery storage well the reason i asked the question is they've asked for a type b evaluation but if the battery storage is going to change the site we probably should be aware of that if it's within the existing site boundary i think that's one thing but it let me see if i can pull this onto the screen are you able to see this um pdf figure okay so this is what they provided in there in their noi and this is a figure of the battery storage and here this is the detailed area it does appear that the battery storage itself would be located centrally located within the approved site boundary you can see that reference might be way small let me zoom in there's the reference map but so i something to to definitely consider and take into thank you uh councilmember jenkins and my colleague katie clifford she did let me know that for the wagon trail solar uh the eight miles of transmission line would be new overhead 230 transmission line and it would connect to the existing blue ridge substation so that was in response to your earlier question council member jenkins on whether or not it would be utilizing existing transmission or not it wouldn't be as proposed and that's wagon trail okay and so um for the battery storage on state line i assume they're going to have to they just can't they're going to have to establish some kind of a foundation for those battery storage facilities is that correct looks like a new access road is going to have to be built and some kind of foundation whether it's concrete or gravel i would imagine so yeah battery containers and inverter skids would either be either be placed on an engineered grade or a poured concrete or utilize steel piles depending on site conditions in your matilla county is what they say here so the the request is for a type b correct you haven't given a there isn't a department of valuation on that yet is that correct we haven't yeah we haven't issued our determination that's correct did we did um determined that their rfa was incomplete and we issued requests for additional information for this particular amendment thank you i guess i would just add council councilmember jenkins that for these requests for review under the type b process that we've been trying to wait till we're more like we're closer with the draft proposed order so that we have a better handle on you know whether there are new or amended conditions the significance of the issue um and i think that served us well rather than issuing the type b review determination just you know earlier before we've had a chance to coordinate with all the reviewing agencies and and do that initial so we're expecting that to come out in about a month after they respond to our information request thank you chase you're on mute thank you with that um i am going to conclude my project updates unless there's any additional anyone have anything else hearing nothing then we'll move on to the next agenda item thank you wally chase and katie for your presentation today the next agenda item agenda item e is the public comment period this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment which includes the boardman hemingway transmission line proposed order and the obsidian solar center proposed order both of which are in the contested case i will look to danita to see if we have anyone wishing to comment i was waiting to see if anybody had a chance to get their hands raised but anybody that's calling in that they're not aware to press star 3 on your phones to raise your hands and people attending the webinar hover over your name and click the little hand icon to raise your hand irene gilbert would like to make comment thank you miss gilbert the floor is yours please go ahead miss gilbert do you have your mute button on do i have my knees now i'm okay um anyway thank you for allowing me to speak today i just wanted to make a couple of comments about the process that you folks use when you're addressing i guess appeals for different decisions that the council makes and the first one being that three minutes is not a lot of time for anybody to present information about anything so i'm not surprised that mr mcallister did not choose to speak to the council the second one would be that um i'm just concerned that the um when you address issues that that people bring in and you break them up into into areas when one of the issues is a ongoing i guess demonstration of it's you really need to look at the cumulative effect of of those decisions and so i've you know i guess those are the main things that i wanted to say and i am submitting to the record for the case that you've just heard the written comment or pardon me the verbal comments that i had intended to make and have asked that those be provided to you folks i realize you may already make the decision but i think you need to understand the limitations that you're placing on people and the fact that you're as a result making decisions absent the full story so that's what i wanted to say thank you thank you miss gilbert do we have anyone else wishing to make public comment not at this time madam chair thank you well with that then the public comment period is closed at 11 54 and our next agenda item is for it's not an agenda item but our next item is for us to take a lunch break council members would 15 minutes suffice or do you need more time about 20. all right well we will go with 20 minutes um so how about if we get back here let's go let's come back at 11 or see me at 12 15. that'll give you 21 minutes hanley thank you thank you thank you everyone thank you teen i guess everyone's made it back let's see",

        "text": " like to bring that energy resilience into the multi-family space we have programs that do it in single family but for the federal funds we just get a lot more bang for the buck doing storage and multi-family which is why we would like to do it in this program to really stretch those federal funds for and so again here's how it would kind of look where we have a rooftop solar program and that would deliver Bill savings to the residents of multi-family houses and then finally and also on battery storage for energy resilience and that brings us to some questions and the first one is how can the Coalition ensure that the benefits from a solar and storage installation are passed on to the residents of a multi-family housing unit and not just the owner and we have several developers in Oregon that have already done this successfully and we think that we can get this built into a program so that we have a prerequisite that anyone participating is passing these benefits onto the residents and not just the owner and of course this is another reason why we like battery storage in multi-family is that those benefits automatically ask to the residents of the building because they're available as backup power in the event of a power outage and so it's a way to ensure positive benefits right to the residents um again a similar question here how can the Coalition reach low-income and disadvantaged communities should a financing product be developed and how can Community organizations support and benefit from the program offerings so that's the concept for multi-family and I would like to just Rob we have a question in the chat and if someone could read that I don't actually have easy access family vendors leverage meter aggregation and only in that's a good question so the question related to how a solar installation might be um essentially spread across a multi-family housing unit where a lot of cases these multi-family housing developments have very minimal common loads for a solar installation to work on and so if you can aggregate The Meters from all of the residents you bring a lot more row load to the site for a solar project to to be able to support and this is one of the sort of technical questions around multi-family and solar that are you know developers are already facing and so we certainly will be looking at this and as mentioned in in IOU territories we have some meter aggregation programs that have already been implemented and it may be that we can come up with a program offering for investor-owned utilities for Consumer owned utilities meter aggregation is a matter for board or city council or other governing body and so what we would like to do is develop a program that has the flexibility to support projects in any utility service territory and hope that the meter aggregation is one of those items that can be worked out what the developer utility partnership that's put together for these projects but it's a really good question and one of the challenges of solar on multi-family developments so does that answer the question and I guess we can we can yes yes that does answer it okay great um so this slide is just a very brief thumbnail view of the two Community solar programs that we're proposing and it's brief because we will have Energy Trust of Oregon and Bonneville environmental Foundation presenting in much greater detail in the coming slides of What's um what's proposed for these programs but again our objective is to support projects in the Oregon Community solar program and that's the existing program that is already underway and we would do this by partnering with Energy Trust utilizing federal funds to provide financial assistance assistance to community solar projects that benefit participants and then finally leveraging the existing Oregon Community solar um to deliver that and then the other option is community solar and consumer owned utility service territories and this is a program that we'll be building from scratch and we will be partnering with Bonneville environmental Foundation to do that and this will be a new program to provide federal funds to hopefully get community solar projects installed across the state in consumer owned utility territories and just as a heads up Bonneville environmental foundation will also likely be working with other Northwest Regional Partners to develop sister programs in other states and that is um you know we're not sure exactly how that's going to look but it may may give us a little benefit to have a Northwest approach so with that I will pass it on to Ryan at energytrust and again questions can be put in the chat or we can save them for the end or you can go visit the questions portal and answer them at your leisure so with that Ryan take it away thanks Rob um so everybody my name is Ryan Cook I'm a senior manager of innovation and developments at Energy Trust of Oregon and we are excited to talk to you about some of the ideas that we're bringing support Community solar projects in our users territory again as Rob mentioned leveraging the existing Oregon Community solar program to make the best use of these silver all dollars next slide please uh so I'm going to quickly talk just about who we are and then a little bit about background about the Oregon Community solar program and then talk about two different concepts for solar um uh funding dollars the first having to do uh with enhanced incentives for projects that meets the program's carpet criteria and the second having to do with some non-financial technical assistance for community-based projects the feedback that um that we'd love to hear from this group uh next slide uh so infrastructure of Oregon is an independent nonprofit um here you many of you likely know us as the administrator of ratepayer funded Energy Efficiency and renewable energy programs here in Oregon we are also actually part of the program Administration team for the Oregon Community solar program which is overseen by opuc but we're not really here in our program Administration capacity today so we serve 2.4 million customers in Oregon and Southwest Washington providing both Energy Efficiency and renewable energy financial assistance technical assistance and all sorts of other great things and on the solar side we serve customers of Portland General Electric and Pacific Power with our with our renewable energy programs um notably our renewable energy funding that we received through rate payers uh 25 of it needs to serve low and moderate income customers and to date our two main programs that helps achieve this are first are solar Within Reach incentive program for um for single family residential customers which Rob's already talked a little bit about and second project incentives for Community solar projects that benefits low-income customers and the concept that I'll be talking about today really expands that that second strategy next slide please so a little bit about the Oregon Community solar program uh this is a program that serves the three Electric ious in city of Oregon's a PG Pacific Power as well as Idaho Power which serves the the Ontario area and some of the basic program requirements are all projects need to be sized between 25 KW and three megawatts uh 10 of each project is required to serve low-income customers and low income subscribers need to receive a mandatory discounts in the amount that they're charged the amount that a project manager can charge a low-income subscriber as caps for for new projects at for about 60 uh so four percent discount 60 of the the value of the bill credits that the customer receives and as part of the program Administration team there's a low income facilitator which is community energy project who's responsible both for verifying low-income customer eligibility and who also will recruit and refer low-income households to projects that they wanted them to be their projects so we already have a lot of infrastructure that we can use to build towards and meet some of the solar for all goals next slide uh within the program there's a feature called the carve outs um which is essentially for projects that go above and beyond it's serving low-income customers or involved in um in the design of projects there's a few different ways to qualify for the carve outs within the Oregon Community solar program first any project that reserves 50 again the program minimum is 10 any project that reserves 50 of project capacity for low-income subscribers uh would qualify for the cargo second any project that's managed by a non-profit or a Cooperative would qualify and then a project that Partners creatively with a community-based organization in the Outreach of a project would also qualify for for the carabouts the program is a limited capacity program there's 160 megawatts that have been authorized by the commission and about 25 of that or 40 megawatts is reserved for projects that may carve out capacity um now where we are today nearly all of the pro of the product program capacity that's not part of the card out has been allocated uh to projects but very little of the carbide capacity has been so we have 47 megawatts remaining in the program of which 36 megawatts is reserved for carve out projects um so primarily what we're seeing the um in solar for all is to to use the substantial amount of funding to uh to fill up the program carve out and make sure that we're delivering really considerable benefits through the Oregon Community solar program that are in line with the priorities that EPA is outlined next slide so our two goals um are one making sure that we're able um there we go uh one is making sure that we are able to get some more community-led Community solar projects uh built and realize through the program and second making sure that we're able to make more low-income subscriptions available to participants in the program and there's really two different strategies that I'm going to talk about WC is useful here one is addressing Financial barriers with a strong and stable incentive for projects that then meet those carbide criteria that I was just talking about and second by addressing non-financial barriers like program complexity by providing enhanced technical assistance and potentially project matchmaking services to community-led projects next slide so for strategy one and here we're really talking about financial assistance and incentives um the problem that we found is that many carve out projects will require additional funding um to get across the finish line and while there have been paths incentive offers available through Energy Trust through Odo through USDA PCF and utilities to provide grants and apprentices to um to projects many of these are kind of temporary in ad hoc and there's not there's not a long-term consistent Statewide incentive Source uh that's uh that's available to help get its carbon projects developed through the community solar program and so our core concept would be to put together a stable incentive that's available to any project that meets both solar for all requirements meaning that 50 of the project would be available to eligible residential",

        "text": " any other questions at this point make others still going thank you okay so I'm going to go ahead and jump right in uh to the two sector-based inventories that we completed again data from 2016 and 2021. um so just touch quickly on the processes that we use that was collected and then of course you go through the results and compare the two uh there were some differences between the two inventories but I think it's important to point out that both of these were completed in accordance with What's called the global protocol or Community scale inventories or GPC and that's a globally accepted framework or methodology if you will for the tracking reporting calculation of the missions and it's really important because it ensures consistency in that data collection and calculation and it really ensures consistency so that we can compare results across the world so per that GPC for those requirements in both inventories we looked at six different emission Source categories or sector Source categories is included um both on the screen stationary energy so the energies in our buildings uh which includes natural gas electricity and molecules of limited Transportation emissions so Vehicles Aviation public transit are chariots in the end rails we looked at emissions from our wastewater treatment process from local Industries waste produced as we produce as we produce solid waste and send that to the landfill or convince um the emissions produced from that and then we also looked at emissions produced as well as removed through agriculture forestry and changes in land so I wanted to just touch briefly on some of the data suppliers that provided the critical data for us this is a big um obviously our local utilities provided us the much needed stationary data electricity and natural gas we did receive Solid Waste information in both Marion County as well as the new Valley garbage Scholars Association local industry data was sourced from the DEQ Department of Environmental Quality we were thankful to staff to provide us the Wastewater data and then at least in 2016 we received our vehicle miles traveled data through the Midland Valley Council of governments and specifically we used a Salem Kaiser area travel demand model for that data um what we found unfortunately 2021 when we started pledging the data was that particular model had been updated at least a couple different times and we learned that we just um unfortunately we're not going to be able to repeat that data for 2021. so we uh we're actually Guided by our consultant with this next process to what's called Google environmental insights Explorer data basically on the ground cell phone data it's free it's publicly available and it's a pretty robust data set that was what was recommended by our consultant so that's what we ended up um I think moving forward is going to be a huge benefit to us it's begin easily accessible and we're going to have a robust consistent data set but unfortunately it did cause some challenges as we tried to look back and do English through 2016. and then I just wanted to quickly point out we did receive things to our partners here some additional data for 2021 when we didn't have in 2016. so here we are with the totals the annual admissions tolls engage um what you can see is in 2021 we had just over 1.2 million metric tons of that carbon dioxide equivalent calculated for Salem City Limits um the safe place to just under seven uh metric tons per person uh 2016 conversely it's a little bit higher right we're seeing 1.5 a little bit more than 1.5 million metric tons of that co2e almost 10 metric tons per um it's a difference about 300 000 metric tons and while it would be awesome I wish I could say that we have reduced our emissions by that much in five years unfortunately looking at the data it was that vehicle miles travel data there was a 40 jump between the two years that stood out to us we know there's been some changes due to copen and people working from home but a 40 drop is is very unlinking so something that we have to keep monitoring as we move forward to the next and here's a look at the data this is a breakdown of the different emission Source activities or sector sources again for this particular one we have separated out electricity from natural gas which is the stationary what you can see in both charts I think clearly is that mobile or Transportation emissions is the highest in both years it does jump so they significantly down from 53 in 2016 down to 41 um again we have the change in data and another interesting piece is that the 42 combined of electricity and natural gas that we saw in 2016 that jump stop fills that difference in 2021 um to where we're at 55 of a total uh what you can see also is that water Wastewater waste generation the tolls up there they put a little bit um that they do remain fairly insignificant compared to those other larger sectors um you briefly describe put the electricity accuracy based on is that based on the department uh emissions that it takes to generate the electricity that cities uses yes it is it's a pretty basic calculation until one hour so we need usage data and there will be utilities and then probably that's that's multiplied by it's called an emission Factor yeah and we actually had local emission factors or we checking the Salem Massachusetts that would reflect to the extent that natural gas is used to generate electricity and did you say that your electricity figure includes the use that includes Natural Gas oh no my apologies that it's stationary we have mobile electricity stationary stationary is the natural gas stations but the electricity would included the natural gas that used generated electricity stationary reported the direct use of natural that's correct yes thank you thanks electricity and stationery are those are for building usage like heating right yes okay so um oh thank you and here's another look this is a different breakdown slightly we for this particular pie chart we pulled out residential versus commercial and Industrial energies versus the natural gas and electricity again so we're seeing that Transportation still the highest 41 from this last year but that commercial and Industrial energy piece does take the next largest China again we're still at 55 between the two so it's pretty significant so a few takeaways from our latest update mentioned this a few times Transportation has continued despite our change in data source has continued to be the largest single source of emissions but I think it's important to note you know that increase that we're seeing 55 of the total is now tied to our building images which has been and I think we can reasonably expect that that's only going to continue to grow um so any activities and that we can do to promote Energy Efficiency and promote renewable energy are going to be and then finally you know it was five years between our last inventory it was recommended that we start doing this morning routine intervals so likely going to try to do the two two years two we're saying two to five we can do every couple years I think that would be yeah I think there's so many small changes and probably over time but that was a big one yeah um so I don't anticipate things about management Mr Heller than constructible you know it's your this information the charts and presentation is that available online well I don't have a presentation posted yet I certainly can that the report the final regret is available online it's actually on deployment actually great thank you Mr Gold thank you again Heather you did a great job um I wanted to say I like love the data I love working at this and saying okay what can we improve our time you know one thing that jumps out to me is that energy sector and um like fuel consumption is a very like I feel like a much more or energy consumption a much more linear like when I think of production and correct me if I'm wrong you're the expert but I wanted like when I think about like you know just including more sustainable energy sources more solar panels more natural fuel sources that that's like a it's a it's pretty clear how we get from here to there right through subsidies and through incentives and like that that's a pretty clear path there and transportation I feel like is an anomaly because it's so difficult to figure out what would it take to get people to self-priving right like what like it's like that's not it's like such a more convoluted and complex equation and for me personally I I was getting a little bit of environmental development just for the fun of it with what it would take to be able to ride the bus to work right and so if I was going to take the bus from my house to daycare do daycare drop off and then go from daycare to work and then do the same in Reverse at the end of the day it would take two hours each way and if I didn't miss any buses and about a half mile of walking total with two kids and so it's like in looking at that even like you know and I love like as a plan efficient that we're making incremental but meaningful progress towards making that more possible for for residents um you know of all like mobilities abilities like families and like living situations and where we're living and I like I think there's so much we can do is what we are doing and I'm so encouraged by the momentum behind that um but I think that like if we are right to have transportation be at the Forefront of this policy making because it is such a complex Invasion and but um I just wanted to kind of put that out there as like another perspective when we're having these conversations about like what it looks like on the ground in terms of reducing our transportation I think the missionary because thank you this I understand is any report but we do have some state and federal legislation that says targets for certain things there's a target for electricity reduction abuse of natural gas CO2 emissions there's a target for electric vehicles and I'm wondering if you know process of doing the inventory around I'm wondering here we're in our planning are we getting do you get any projections of what they impact on inventory might be if we actually start to meet those goals and um because it seems to be the biggest factors here these are those are the two biggest factors if we eventually achieve the goals of electric vehicles and achieve the goals how that we have any projections or any ideas that targets in relation to those of those Point impact with those two goals the targets that were set at an overall goals um yeah how might that reduce the inventory it's the interaction",

        "text": " to educate them um you know what I didn't mention is I actually had a phone call from somebody who was trying to find council member buyer's email address um and I know politely that no I'm not going to be providing you that but that I pivoted to you know how our process works what can we do to help you better prepared to you know review the application review our draft proposed order you know and provide substantive comments that you know potentially could influence the council member's decision so um it was a good pivot I had a very good conversation with her talked with her about a half an hour um she definitely was appreciative of that and indicated that she would would be um you know getting back to me in the near future for probably thoughts and ideas on you know how to better understand our process so that that's essentially what we try to do um but it is to try to you know limit people trying to influence you outside of the correct ways within process so just a question with respect to what after oh Cindy Condon for the record a question with respect to what um Patrick mentioned so do we have to do anything now to specifically exclude to um acknowledge what Patrick said and support that position or I'm actually writing a note to myself right now I'm going to look into this issue and I can get back to as to what steps we might need to take in order to make clear again I don't I have not researched this yet my how I think it how I would like to see it resolved is as Todd has said we have acknowledged that it's been received so everyone is aware as well you know the applicant is aware of it but I don't I think it should be resolved right there nothing further is done with it it is not part of the evidentiary record it is not something that you consider as part of your decision- making that's how I think it should be resolved but I need to do some research to see if you know if this is arise Arisen in other context and see if there's support for that thank okay unless there's any other questions on that I'll move on to the wagon trail solar project um so we had a public informational meeting on January 7th um it was scheduled to be in Lexington uh and in fact it did partially happen in Lexington um the weather um precluded us from going out there um so um that was clearly not a good idea to to drive during that time um but you know luckily there was some interest um on the project and the city council members um had opened up the the location where we were going to have it which was basically the town hall they hosted people who wanted to show up in person and um several people did show up uh in person which was a nice opportunity so you know while from the staff standpoint it was a virtual meeting it actually truly was a hybrid meeting um so um Chase did a great job Chase McVey Walker who's the Project Lead did a great job on that so just wanted to acknowledge that um we did have the meeting we had to adjust kind of within a two days before the meeting and I think appropriately uh we still held it uh and I think it went very well if council member buyer attended in online um if you had any thoughts sure thank you first kudos to staff for making that happened wow because there was a forum for people who wanted to attend one thing that I noticed that chase did and uh shout out to chase was really helping the audience understand where to find information so he directed them to specific exhibits where if you're interested about Wildlife go to exhibits can't remember the number and reminded them which standards were applicable so I think Chase did a really nice job I think it sets us up for other public information meetings moving forward and then I just had this Wild Hair which would cost more money and more staff time which is what we do but we have the public information meeting so early in the process and we may not see an application for 6 months to a year if there's some way to do almost almost a video information meeting prior to the public hearing so people really understand where the information is and how to focus on it it wouldn't have to be in person though in person is always better but just something online that says before you come to this public hearing here's what you should be looking for here's where to find things and um to simplify it for people and to help um the public direct their comments a little bit better it's it's just we do these public information meetings and then by the time it's all said and done you're like which project is this so if we're feeling that way maybe I'm the only one but um the public probably is as well so thank you but again shout out to staff for making that happen and to chase for really outlining things for the public um so yeah couple couple responses on that so part of the process there are two optional public informational meetings one is at the notice of intent stage and one is at the complete application stage um the both of them are optional um we do both of them now as a matter of course um so even if the project is you know non-controversial it may be that we do it virtually only um at the second one if we don't think that there's much in interest um but we will do that um so the first one previously um and this is probably I don't know eight years ago the sort of the staff policy was to only do the notice of intent um public information meeting but not the complete application meeting well when we did an assessment we really thought about it we we we came to the same conclusion there's actually less value I think at the public information or at the notice of intent stage than the completeness stage because there is that potential it could be a couple years away now we think there actually is value doing it both um having it at the notice of intent stage um sets the sort of standpoint of who we are you know it's not just a a notice in the mail U or by email it's we go out there we have that sort of conversation with people so we think that's important but the completeness one is exactly what you're saying now if there was a sign ific an time frame between the determination completeness and the draft proposed order I would say absolutely what we try to do though is we work on the draft proposed order as we're reviewing it for completeness so in many circumstances the completeness public information meeting actually is relatively close several months um from the draft proposed order and you know one of the things that we did is we created that comment portal which is designed is not obligated but it's designed designed to have people Orient towards standards and Exhibits and you know information that's in the draft proposed order not just that I like the project or I don't like the project it's sort of the why and this more specific um kind of evaluation so we you know for all the exact things that you said we've tried to orient you know the process to be more like that um but it's always good to re-evaluate making sure that it actually is having sort of that effect so omit being in the audence she's listening to this and um that helps probably her to think about these things as well because we can always revisit and making sure uh to make sure that you know what we're doing has the effect that we we think and we hope that it does um and then last on my list is uh we just confirmed that we will have a February council meeting so it will be on the 23d only so the Friday probably be much like today um 8:30 till you know early afternoon um we'll provide more details about that and it will be here in Salem and virtually of course um with that I will conclude couple litigation oh yeah go ahead just want to keep you apprised of uh what's happening in the litigation world of cases that you've been involved with uh as you are aware your decision on the Nolan Hills project was appealed by mailla County oral argument on that case was on January 11th before The Supreme Court that oral argument is available on the Supreme Court's website for your viewing I'd recommend that you do take some time to take a look at it you'll see the Supreme Court considering a lot of the same arguments that you heard uh presented last July and and that link was sent to All council members great so you already have the link so uh second update is on your decision on request for Amendment one on the Boardman to Hemingway project that has uh your as you will recall you denied requests for contested case in that matter uh one of the uh persons whom you denied that request Miss Irene Gilbert has appealed your denial of the request for contested case she has filed that in circuit court and D doj is uh just this week filed a motion to have that transferred to the Supreme Court that is pending chair Grill that's Vice chair how um that's the first time I've seen a supreme court argument uh being made on you know that you could watch on a video like that is that standard practice now or is that relatively new that was really cool I enjoyed watching that here I don't know how long that's exactly how long it's been available but for quite quite some time yeah anytime our cases are argued before the court you can view them they're recorded you can view them live uh but then they're recorded and available to view afterwards yeah that good thanks for passing that on all right I think that concludes the Council report wonderful so if we move on to agenda Item B we have consideration by Council of permanent amended rules for standby generator exemptions this is an action item for Council we have Thomas Jackman rules coordinator here to present to us good morning Tom good everyone uh so yeah we're here to discuss the um adoption of standby generator exemption rules that have been amended um go ahead and go to the next slide uh previe slide yep there we go um so again just as a reminder this we're here doing this role making as a result of a house bill 2063 that was passed in 2021 uh which prohibits Council from requiring a person to proposing to construct a standby generating facility from submitting an exemption request to council uh it doesn't change whether or not a project would would be subject to council jurisdiction it's just whether or not they have to seek uh approval from Council",

        "text": " period let me try this one more time and then I'll have mercy on everyone and stop are you going to share graphs of the project order with other state agencies we seek their input and we want to make sure that we have the information correctly so we seek their comments and if we have need clarification you know we will you know for lack of a better terminology we don't share a draft with them but we get their permit requirements and make sure that we have that correct so I think it's essentially the same thing that you're asking but it's maybe in a different context okay so I've taken up on this time and it's getting late so thank you very much and we'll be presenting our written comments thank you uh next is Bill Royal Bill are you there Bill your your mic is open uh seems like you're typing but if you want to provide an oral comment you are certainly allowed to do that can you hear me now yes we can hear you now okay I super apologize I don't know why that was a problem but sorry can you can we raise this mic or is that on his end can you hear me now we heard you really loud and then you really faded away okay I'll just hold this right up if you can hear it now we can just continue now we can hear you okay all right uh my name is Bill Royal I'm the Chief Operating Officer for Union Point custom feeds where are you a family owned animal feed mill located here in our Mill would be the the mill most affected in this region a significant majority of our commodity sourcing comes from the local area it is a selling point for our products our Mill is particularly sensitive to this issue I'm telling you to telling you today that this will drive up our costs through the reduction of competition and thus it inflicts a material harm on our business this reduces the amount of efu land in the state and Country the claim that the land isn't being taken out of production is insulting if I borrow twenty dollars from you and don't pay it back for 40 years you don't have a balance of twenty dollars during that duration I will Echo that efu stands for exclusive Farm use for a reason billionaires and multinationals are purchasing our farmlands at record rates and this takes more farmland or way as the operator of a feed mill I can tell you that reducing local Fields will make our local Commodities even harder to find we need every acre possible Additionally the state should keep in mind that once you've set this precedent it will be hard to argue against the next request and it will be even harder to defend in court and my my prior career was in tech so one quick note on the technical aspects environmentally virtually all materials including solar cells Slough off in the beginning and off gas as well the claim by the applicant is flat out untrue nothing that nothing leeches from this Tech is just wrong now I have no doubt that the rain will make quick work of that and the study range that's being claimed will be done will not track that data properly as it will wrap before much of the rain has fallen so how do they plan on mitigating that runoff from getting into the streams they can't and the 40-year lifespan that's being claimed is being done by the same industry that brought us solyndra so I'm sorry but I don't buy it oh one last thought as I thought about this project I wondered if I could buy some Farmland in South Korea so I did a little research in South Korea land ownership is governed by the act on the acquisition of real estate by foreigners under this law foreigners are generally allowed to purchase non-farm lands such as residential and Commercial properties foreigners are certainly sorry are generally not allowed to purchase agricultural land unless they meet certain criteria such as having permanent residency in South Korea or have been living in the country for an extended period if South Korean companies want to do business they should petition their government to change the policy and some of us would be more open-minded don't act as though we're on anything resembling at a Level Playing Field because we're not until then I see no reason for any South Korean company to get any sort of exceptions thank you thank you Mr well we definitely were able to hear you that time so uh we got everything sorry about that hopefully I didn't just blow out the room no no no no you were fine I just was saying that we we got everything on the record for that so thank you good deal appreciate it thank you Hilary foot but all right that is uh we get a little feedback but try it again yeah I'm not sure we're we're not getting feedback from us but try it again and see if it works I can hear my echo echo all right I apologies for that is that is that working can you hear me yeah we can hear you fine you're fine Hillary I don't know if you can hear us but we can hear you fine you're fine even though I've got a little bit of echo in the background on the background all right well we're waiting for Hillary I will I will say hey check okay that doesn't sound like it's getting feedback um Hillary foot is the farm and four special with Specialists with the Department of land conservation development so uh I think she's probably been on all night and she's heard all of the comments related hopefully she can help wrap some of this up Hillary you're unmuted if you want to try again Hillary if you can hear us you muted all right while we're waiting for Hillary does anybody else want to make a okay we'll give it a few minutes all right try that again Hillary oh you just muted yourself okay we unmute the line um Ty can you hear me now okay thank you thank you to confusion so I am the fireman Forest land use specialist with DOD and the night is no longer young so I'll be very very brief with my uh comments this evening and we'll follow up with written submissions so the first thing I wanted um say was really to Echo Jim Johnson from the Department of agriculture's comments earlier this evening about just the history of Farmland protection in a Willamette Valley and also about the importance of the farm impacts test and the review process so RS 215 296 and join him in encouraging the applicant to really pay careful attention to the standards established by the courts on the degree of analysis required to adequately address potential if it's significant impacts to surrounding Farm operations and then you know secondly I just will something else about the soil thing so as Todd has pointed out you know earlier this evening all solar projects that fall under the council's jurisdiction do not meet the acreage specials that are established in our agency rules um and therefore all projects that are reviewed by the council necessarily require an exception to the states agricultural lands preservation goal for this particular project I just wanted to you know express some concern about the possibility that there also might be an exception required to the state's agriculturally and preservation goal not just because of the jurisdictional threshold but because of other standards in our agency rules particularly the standard that prohibits solar facilities on class 1 Class 2 prime or unique soils um particularly given the extent of prime soils that appear to be mapped in the project area at this very you know early stage of the review process so I just want to express that I'm also quite interested in seeing the project facilities laid out you know over the soil mapping for nrcs capability classifications as well as the the relative to that to that particular standard all right and and that's it thank you um for the opportunity to get that in thanks Hilary we got it I don't I don't see anybody else online um I did have a question uh are you guys getting any subsidies or special tax write-offs or privileges with this project that you'll be doing so when it comes to solar projects in general this could this for the entirety of the United States there's something called ITC it's a tax credit um so just from the general standpoint that is something that this project would have just because all other solid projects that when projects have it as um and then so the answer is yes but that's a standard thing that happens with all solar projects and wind projects okay because earlier you were saying and it shows back on your signs too that it'll be bringing in 1.6 million to Lynn County in property taxes so when you break that down by the acreage that you say it's about fourteen hundred dollars per acre that it'll be bringing in which something I mean it's not like it's that much more or more even than agriculture would produce in a year um but when you take into account the subsidies and different things that you guys will get will it actually be a greater good or is it actually going to cost the taxpayers money in the end so we're not that 1.6 doesn't anticipate you know reduction or anything like that like when it comes to tax payments with the county that's something we have not had a conversation about um so that 1.6 is just general projection of what we're looking at for uh increased like tax revenue for property tax um but I also like to reiterate like we are all we would also like to propose a community benefits package outside of just general taxes you know um and that's something that I am looking for feedback from the community to see if there's any pet projects or any special type of funds that like the county itself and the community would like to see and see if that's something the project can support okay thank you okay last call all right thanks everybody for coming out tonight those of you particularly who stuck it out to the end um you know we we appreciate your time we definitely going to take your comments you know as we evaluate um the notice of intent and if anybody wants to stick around and ask us or the applicant questions after this we'll be here as long as you want to ask us questions so thanks everybody this is",

        "text": " a first reading and then it would go into second reading and public hearings and with that I think I am turning it over to Courtney all right I'm going to step back because others will be coming forward good afternoon Sharon Harrington Commissioners pleasure to be in front of you again today on this important topic um I'm not going to go over the legal history in detail because I know you all are aware of it want to be considerate of your time but we did just want to remind your board of the two-night circuit cases that have led us to an informed this work um that held that the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits criminalizing the uncon unavoidable consequences of being um when there is not an alternative available shelter available to the homeless person who might be camping on public property so those two cases and holdings in part led to Oregon House Bill 3115 which became law in 2021 that says that any city or county that regulates the access sitting line sleeping Outdoors on public prop property has to be um has to have regulations that are objectively reasonable as to time place and manner in regards to the person experiencing homelessness um just a reminder Washington County doesn't currently have a county-wide ordinance regulating campaign on public property but should your board decide to move forward with the proposed ordinance that's in your materials it would need to be in compliance with House Bill 3115 by July 1st 2023 which is rapidly approaching you've also seen this slide in previous presentations it's just a reminder of the goals that we had in the front of our minds as we endeavored in this work and I just wanted to stress here that the impact of adopting an ordinance regulating public property in regards to Camping well to give the county a tool to regulate public property in regards to camps so as Marty mentioned I just wanted to pause for a second sure because it said once on the worksheet I think Marnie may have said it here but we're already now on slide six and it hasn't been stated in writing in the publicly available slides that any such ordinance would only apply to the unincorporated areas of Washington counties and I think that a really vital fact to State sure right up front so the ordinance would apply to Washington County owned property our ordinance wouldn't imply inside cities especially if a city had a different ordinance I do think arguably if a city didn't have an ordinance we might be able to manage Washington county-owned property pursuant to our ordinance but you're you're correct it applies to Washington County property in unincorporated Washington County okay but if a city has a has an ordinance they would enforce their ordinance inside the city but the first part of what you said is Washington County owned property and you didn't qualify it apologies so okay and unencry yes yeah so I would ask Miss Angie that we get a new slide before the policy development that makes it black and white clear unincorporated only the chair the team can update the presentation afterwards thank you thank you um again so a little bit of the work that we've done up until this point first we were before you're bored on January 10th to talk about the broad strokes and um concepts of what time place manner meant and what we had seen as best practices discusses with you and received your feedback at that time you directed staff to have some conversation with these stakeholders and to bring um to look at some different possibilities and to bring home to bring the draft ordinance to you all which is in your materials today um we also have done quite a bit of city and special district coordination and collaboration I personally have been involved since last summer I believe the meetings may have been going on even before that but they are um we were meeting about every other month they were attended by representatives from the cio's office sitting managers and representatives of Special Districts including Tualatin Valley Parks and rec district and Tualatin Valley fire and rescue these conversations we always talked about common goals resource needs uh challenges with implementation and enforcement and really importantly trying to align on the policy development for regulating public property in regards to um unhoused camping as well as developing systems to coordinate on Sheltering available shelter county-wide as we move forward we know that's going to be important um I think it as I'll discuss as we go forward I think we got alignment on a lot of things but not perfect alignment um we also had conversations with stakeholders including Clean Water Services Outreach providers and service providers to talk about what the impact on their work would be if we adopt this and then as Marnie mentioned um really since 2020 we've had a robust interdepartmental staff group as she mentioned she mentioned all the groups so I won't mention them again also solid waste and recycling has been heavily involved from the encampment management side but um we actually have multiple variations of these groups that meet very regularly to just to discuss all the all the challenges and work that's involved in this area and I'm going to turn it over to Deanna hello thank you for having me today Diana negredi she her pronouns and I'm here to talk to you about our expanding shelter system in Washington County which is very exciting because as you might know Intel really 2020 we did not have very much available shelter really what we had available was Winter shelter from November to about March which was really limiting for folks who were living outside well any even more importantly to put a finer point on it it was volunteer run yes it was volunteer run and it went from one location to another location to another location so for our community members who are already living outside in chaos it's just creating more chaos and really difficult to track so as you can see from this slide which I believe you have seen this slide previously that we really are looking at decreasing our winter shelter available availability because we want to increase our year-round shelter so we have our Bridge shelter which we will be transitioning to be calling non-congregate which non-congregate is the individual motel rooms and other single-use rooms um for families and individuals and couples to live in we have our congregate shelter sites that are the more traditional shelter settings that you are accustomed to and then we also have our alternative shelter available which we right now we have our pods on in Hillsboro and that we really are looking to increase not only the capacity of our system but the available options for our residents living outside uh so some of the improvements that we've seen in our shelter system has been in that increased capacity but also what we've implemented this year when the winter shelter season launched was a coordinated entry system for accessing shelter one to really increase transparency and also make it easier for those living outside to access shelter um so this what what we built was a centralized referral system along with an assessment to accurately assess where this person would be most successful in shelter what we've also been able to do is um previously as you kind of have already brought up that our winter shelter system was very limiting uh in years previous even with increased capacity we had really long wait list that people we had already during this shelter season we had a wait list of about 130 people at the start of winter shelter season now we have about a 24-hour period of turnover from when a person says I would like to go to shelter to when they can enter shelter so just that ability to access shelter has really improved in our County also all of our congregate settings have emergency beds or e-beds available for law enforcement to have drop-offs uh in the middle of the night or whenever they need access to those uh it's our only one night shelter stays but it's that really that initial contact with the individual living outside to get them into shelter and or into another long-term housing program we're also looking at more shelter availability and options that we want for people to have options such as alternative sites because we know that congregate settings are not suitable to and that like I already said previously that those options are also becoming more readily available for folks so that we are having a shorter wait list and turnaround time I do want to kind of wrap this with a personal story of um you know right now when we work with encampments and when we have closures or cleanups we have been able to offer shelter to all of the participants who are living at those encampments uh a lot of the times those will see folks kind of access shelter right away when we do the initial cleanups but then we're kind of following those residents who might not really want to access shelter right away and one person in particular we had followed from our cleanup on 185th and Shaw which as you I'm sure are all very aware of that and really as of last week we were able to meet with him and he said I'm ready to go into shelter I see my friends going into shelter I see my friends going into housing I know that it's working and within 24 hours we were able to get him into shelter and so I want to stress that we do have availability for those who are living outside when they are ready to go to shelter bringing that to life it underscores for we I have to remind myself that we have to be patient right that whole meeting people where they are in their Journey towards that longer term stability so thank you yes for making me relearn that lesson I need to ask about the term ebeds e as in emergency yes if you can see there it's really coming from law enforcement that's kind of how they refer to those key beds emergency beds emergency drop-off beds um you know I think that's one of the important things too is making sure we are all using the same language so we know what we're talking about but yes thank you for training me of course thank you yes it's Deanna all right so now uh what you've all been waiting for I'm going to walk you through the um the broads outline of the ordinance I'm not going to go through every section and share I I want to apologize there was an error in the cover sheet we actually have proposed this for 8.54 so you're going to hear me refer so sorry about that um okay so if you hear me refer I'm gonna so if you're following along I see commissioner Willie has a a copy I'm going to refer to some of the sections I'll",

than comments on the project and it will be um really enlightening to see how this moves forward so thank you to staff for the great opportunity thank you for that comment and thank you for participating and getting some insight directly if there are no further questions Mr secretary please call the roll Harry choctote don't see council member choctote on the line anymore so we still

forward to working with you throughout this thank you council members all right our next agenda item is the Madras solar facility financial institution list request this is an action item and we have Sicily Fleming fiscal analyst prepared to present good more well we're on afternoon good afternoon Sicily good afternoon chair Grail members of the council for the record I am Cecily Fleming the fiscal analyst in the signing division at the Oregon Department of energy I am here today to recommend Council add the arch insurance company to the council's list of financial institutions pre-approved to act as issuers of bonds and letters of as you are aware Council rules require site certificate holders to obtain Financial Assurance to meet the retirement and financial Assurance standard from financial institutions approved by Council Council evaluates its Financial Assurance forms and approved entities annually and the last annual update occurred in January of this year in April ecoplexus Incorporated the site certificate holder for the Madras solar energy facility requested Council consideration to add Arch insurance company to the council's pre-approved list for their use in obtaining a bond for the project David Skidmore Chief audit executive and odoe's director's office reviewed the qualifications of arch insurance company and concluded that the company demonstrates sufficient Financial strength to act as issuers for coverage provided to the state of Oregon a copy of Mr skidmore's evaluation was provided in your meeting materials and I believe Mr Skidmore may be present on the line today should you have additional questions for him foreign based on the financial strength of arch insurance company outlined in this evaluation staff recommends that Council add Arch into Arch insurance company to its list of financial institutions pre-approved to act as issuers for bonds and Leadership credits for site certificate holders use and the um the slide here just shows all of the entities that have previously been proved by Council and then the addition of arch insurance company in italics so that's how the list will look should you approve uh the recommendation today and that concludes my presentation well thank you that was directed to the point does anyone have questions for chair Grail this is Kent yes Vice chair how I'll make a motion uh I move the council add Arch insurance company to the list of council approved financial institutions for use by site certificate holders in obtaining financial instruments as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair how do we have a pure Grails Cindy Condon um that motion thank you councilor Condon are there any further or is there any conversation discussion about the motion chair Grail Cindy Condon again yes um uh not specific to the motion itself um I am curious and I'm certainly you might certainly be able to answer this but with respect to the review of the list that we were just shown um and the recent banking financial um upheaval I guess is there a re-analysis of these uh financial institutions including Arch uh insurance company on an annual basis or yes yeah that's what um we did that in January of this year and that's that's the typical timeline we do that around December or January each year so we evaluated the credit ratings of each uh each of the entities on the list annually yes yes okay and given the recent um Financial issues um I don't think any of these financial institutions came up as you know in the mix of of uh problems but if something comes up um you know if we were to have read one of the banks in the in in the news um is there opportunity to review just on an ongoing basis you know on an ad hoc basis I guess I absolutely okay thank you thank you thank you for that if there's nothing further Mr secretary please call the roll Ken how yes and buyer yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you well everyone we have concluded our agenda unless I've missed something so I'm going to pause if Todd can tell me if I missed anything that is everything Madam chair thank you Mr secretary I appreciate everyone's participation and engagement I know sometimes virtual meetings are challenging I again apologize for my delay and fumbling getting logged in today so I apologize for that I will try to do better uh next time uh the time is now 1209 and the June 1st 2023 meeting of the energy facility citing council is now adjourned thank you everyone thanks everybody thank you

        "text": " and a way to address this issue and then i think the last point i'll make is just that first sentence about rto shouldn't be evaluated as a tool to solve all the industries problems i think there are ways we can replicate problems in the and there are ways that we can acknowledge those problems or opportunities and use an rto to make some course corrections and i think that can happen on a couple of fronts one is really valuing ders and community-based resources um we might not necessarily have requirements around utilities to procure those resources uh in in the fullest extent that that might be valuable from an environmental justice perspective but there may be ways in an rto that you could really think about valuing ders valuing community based projects and establishing those wealth building opportunities it's also worth noting that utilities um in addition to developers stand to really benefit from an rto and potentially have a particular benefit for their shareholders i think we need to think about how to create some equity in that front and make sure the benefits flow to but also how can you take some of that potential profit or opportunity and shift it in ways that can create benefit back to the communities so it's really about balancing benefits and burdens uh thanks sorry i realize it went on for a while there but hopefully there was some good information there for odo and some food for thought for other participants great i appreciate the feedback um does anyone have any uh responses to orianna or any other any of the other comments or additional feedback they'd like to provide okay spencer i see your hand up thanks adam uh i did want to i wanted to say two things first i do think there is pretty good evidence in a way that arguments that are made about rto and having a more efficient grid are sometimes hard to come up with good data to reinforce an argument but for environmental impacts of rto one area that i think is hard to dispute is that an rto forces the most efficient thermal resources to run soonest and the there was a study done 10 years into the creation of rtos that compared about a thousand power in rtos versus states without rtos and it found that those plants ran about 14 more efficiently in an rto on a heat rate basis which means they used less fuel and in general those would be the plants that have the best pollution controls and are built the most efficiently um so at least for now that that study is a little bit dated now and a little bit harder to extrapolate to 2021 and going forward but i think there's pretty good evidence of at least the thermal side of the grid being run more efficiently and having pretty direct impacts on on lower emissions in rto the second thing i wanted to mention is building on orianna's last comments as oregon and the west thinks about artille formation i think we're in a nice position in a sense to learn from how governance has worked or hasn't worked in the other seven markets in the us that we can buff from and frankly some of those markets have done the better and worse on governments in our experience having a relatively flatter organization like what the kaiso runs which gets more complicated once you add more states but that's a better model to encourage more participation by more stakeholders the rtos that from their beginning set up complicated hierarchical committee structures they certainly work but it does create a barrier to participate for consumer advocates non-profits of all stripes and smaller independent developers and so to the extent that the legislature can think about what are the best practices from other rtos and governance that we could draw from i think we could do better than some rtos have done and finally on that point ferc finally established an office of public participation recently which was way overdue which creates a kind of ombudsman function at the federal level um to support some of these environmental justice equity and governance issue oversight that's been missing i think at the federal level for some time thank you spencer uh next we'll go to if you're speaking ravi you must be a mute because not hearing you okay can you hear me now yes okay sorry um yeah so what i was saying was uh i think orianna and spencer were right in mark on several fronts so i just want to number one uh emphasize that i agree um especially on the in an rto would have been having a single system dispatching able to you know dispatch lower heat rate units versus a high heat radiate unit definitely does help in the decarbonization goal so definitely i think one one thing for you all to is that all the seven rto isos that have been formed they were formed in a carbon environment this is an opportunity for the region to consider what an rto would look like in a decarbonized world so so this is definitely an opportunity but it also presents a lot of challenges as discussed previously both as mentioned by orianna and mary and as well as spencer so so i i think i think what what i what i would like to say you guys to consider is that you know whereas an rtu may not be the all in solution but it is also an opportunity to see how we can drive the future uh decarbonization in the region and i use the term region because it's not just oregon but it's oregon washington and other states that may be part of this uh whole effort as how we can best not just the transmission side but also on the demand and the supply side it's in them in a manner that results in in an are in a cleaner and a greener footprint that none of the other rtos have been able to achieve so it's it's an opportunity and a challenge creativity and innovations will be at uh at the highest here um but don't forget the cost part um the cost and and and how it will overall impact the rates and and the rates uh do impact the economy so you know there are a lot of high uh energy consuming businesses that are central into oregon and washington so so consider that as one of the points uh as you proceed in discussion with the formation of an rto you can call it an rto under a clean power plant or a decarbonized world and and that's really what you're trying to hit and target for thank you great thank you robin i think some of those themes we'll see in questions 10 and 11 coming up in particular on governance and market um i saw nicole you have your hand up thanks adam i wanted to connect something that i heard uh orianna mentioned that brought up earlier in the conversation commissioner tani the importance of governance i think um you know in order for states like oregon to ensure that the values that we hold true in our state are are maintained if our utilities should join an rto it's important to have that governance piece right it's important for the states to retain the ability and the authority over the those important issues so i put environmental justice and and use of ders and and things like that in that thank you nicole um so not seeing any other hands raised unless you have any additional comments or feedback on this one i'll move to question number nine and uh not surprising you probably can tell based on the timing here uh i'm not sure we're gonna get too much roundtable discussion but i think it's good because we're having good uh thorough discussion on each of these topics so we might have to quickly address some of our additional questions when we get there but i think we're doing okay on time uh so question number nine on climate i think this one might go a little bit so again similar uh to the previous questions looking for you know feedback uh how climate resilience implications resulting from rto formation would or not be profitable to the status quo uh thinking about um you know our rapidly changing climates catastrophic wildfires uh historic ice uh you know the dense smoke issues we had impacting transmission earlier this year etc let's get into the feedback there uh again it's uh uh for this one before uh uncertainty without knowing specific design of an rto it's hard to uh really address the question uh sharing resources neighboring utilities and regions sharing resources with one another is quote simply easier in an rto and makes it easier to respond to climate driven extreme weather transmission paths and rto may reduce barriers to transmission developments allowing for additional routes for energy to flow in the event the path goes down example the blue light fire on the koi this summer situational awareness an rto may provide superior operational visibility and control of generators and transmission to better respond to severe events complications stakeholders need to be working on resiliency within the current model and rto formation may introduce complications to those efforts at the local level diversity of resources uh geographic diversity assuming an rto drives additional transmission development it could help to support the development of diversity of least cost resources over a wide area this geographic diversity will help the region to ensure the resilience and reliability of the overall system resource procurement states will retain purview over decisions about resource procurement while an rto will dispatch the resources made available according to lease costs these cost solutions development of resilience solutions closer to load could be at odds with the development and operation of least cost regional transmission solutions again ferc order 2 2 2 2 came up that order allows for microgrid projects to aggregate and bid into wholesale energy markets potentially providing a new pathway to develop these resilient one commenter however noted or believes that it is quote unlikely that an rto would be a form that would promote and then on the issue of wildfire nexus mitigation versus impacts unlikely that an rto could be designed to do much to mitigate wildfire risks but it must be designed to take into consideration how wildfire could impact operations and diversification the diversification of resources geography and alternate paths that an rto may make viable can help to address the risks posed by wildfire to the power system common standards and practices and rto can improve situational awareness and support the development of common standards and practices such as for operational measures like public safety power shut off during high wildfire risk transmission development while an rto is unlikely to mitigate wildfire risks to the extent it supports additional transmission development and rto could alleviate constraints that would otherwise occur due to past game impacted by wildfire and then our discussion questions um so again do you support or oppose particular",

        "text": " that has not been decided yet. However it is realized. And then the last one was, okay, how much is going to be built out there? This was. I heard this on every single phone call. What's going to be built? You're going to build on the entire property. There's 100,000 square foot max limit that has been proposed as a condition obviously, it is subject to the board of county commissioners. There was much discussion about this, and as much as I don't like reading something off of a slide, I would like you to listen to this so I can read it to you. New building floor area shall not exceed 100,000 sqft. In the event that one or more existing buildings, at the time of the approval of the special use permit, are found to be functionally obsolete or in an irretrievable state of disrepair, that those buildings may be demolished and reconstructed. The replacement construction square foot shall not count against the new building allowance of 100,000 sqft. Nor shall the replacement buildings be required to occupy the same or similar footprint as the previously existing buildings that were removed. Buildings that are scheduled to be removed right now are on the adjacent side of the property. Any new construction at this point in time is scheduled to be on the interior of the property, away from adjacent constructs. Yes, sir. What is. Is that the existing square footage out there? No, sir, it is not exactly. I do not know the exact number of square footage I have. Mister Goodspeed will be up to speak in a moment. Mister Dinkins might be able to help with that as well. Okay, mister chair. Yeah, so 100,000 sqft, just to put that in context, that's approximately two acres. It is an acres. 43,567. Yeah, just. It's just under. Or, excuse me, just over. So that 100,000 sqft will be constituted by new kennels, the clinic. So those are constructs that will immediately start counting against that. Those are whatever we're planning. Like I said, we're planning for the future. That number can be adjusted, but in conversation with multiple different departments, that was a reasonable number, at least we thought to propose to the board of county commissioners. And then you have the purview to make that final judgment. And Ken timeline on any of that building? I have not. It's completely up to the funding allocations. I think Mister Goodspeed would be better suited to answer that than I would. Can we have Mister Goodspeed come up here and answer that question, please? What? Can we do this, please? Before you go, let's finish with his presentation and go into the facilities. Actually, Mister chairman, we timed that just perfectly. So I was just going to show you that we had a couple of other iterations. This is the fourth one. Providely yield to current facility is right around 51,000 sqft. That's existing out there. Combined our current animal services 21,000 sqft timeline. I mean, as soon as we get approval and we start to move forward. We're in a three to four year timeline. If we had the adequate funding and we decide and agree upon moving forward, that would be the new facilities constructed. So I don't want to shed a little bit of light on why we did the 100,000 square foot. That is not a goal, that's a maximum. We initiated the programming phase, which is the first phase of any project. You go down with the end user, you do research of other counties, what they've done, and say, what do you actually need to be successful? What do you need for the future? And the first number came back at 95,000. Board knows we were looking around 35,000 sqft. So we immediately said, hey, we got to trim this down. And so we're trying. Our goal now is about a 45,000 square foot total first phase. That includes 150 kennels, that includes the clinic, the adoption area, and where the administration is for the workers. So that's what we're shooting for with our current budget in phase one. Yeah, mister chair, is that utilizing this part of this 51,000 square foot that's existing, it's additional to it? Correct. And so I can speak on that. So that was one of the first things when I, when I saw the property, we drove by and it's a beautiful piece of property. I mean, some of our number one goal was, all right, we can't touch this view, right? So front paddocks, the way it looks, we have to be able to hide, if we have the opportunity to build out there, hide the viewpoint where in the residents drive by, it's that same beautiful view. So we're going to try to match the architecture the best we can with the existing structures. We have no intent besides reusing the two households there that you heard for animal control, for the property to the east and to the west, having some type of residence there full time for off staff, what's going to be. My next question is, are we planning on having full time staff out there residing on the property? Yes. To account for any issues after hours or anything that goes on, and safety and security of the property. And would that be county staff or could that possibly be. Well, we are still discussing that. Whether it will be a deputy on site or it will be a county staff, we have not decided on that. So deputy. It'll either be deputy on staff or county or deputy on site or county staff. And in the existing barns of the open area, we were going to leave all that alone. It would be great if we could utilize the back area, if we can find a use for it. We talked about they have a barn cat type of program. They have that. Maybe we could put a section there. If we could reduce the new square footage, we could have some of that as storage in the back, maybe for feed or something like that. We're going to try to utilize that when we get further into the programming. So the reason for up to 100,000 sqft is for future additions? Correct. Okay, so how much? Yeah, in the future, it's a forever home, 135, 50,000. Going to add 45? No, they can have up to 100,000 additional. That's what the statues permit limitation is. And they're talking about at this point, adding an additional 45,000 square. Total. Yep, total. And then possibly in the future, if it was needed, you would have an additional 55,000 sqft available to add, according to what this special use permit says. And those are the empty blue boxes and red boxes. You see that if administration needed to grow or if they needed to go into, which is one of the reasons we have to move now, a better quality surgery suite to have that turnover time or dwell time, reduce. And then also additional kennels. So, currently, the pods that we're looking at are pods of 50. And you'll see the three blue squares on the map, centrally located behind the back barn. And the idea behind those were, if you don't have all the animals together barking, it reduces that sound and that noise. So these are some of the strategies going into it from the point of where the noise is going to be administered from. So each pod has 50 animals, and each pod has strips of ten animals. So those ten are together? Ten are together. Ten are together in a set of 50. Then they're separated physically and there's another pot of 50. So that was early on. Right. We're going into, with our architect and our specialists in animal control designs, of what tactics can we take to reduce the number two issue, which we know first was aesthetics for us, and we know now it's number one for the residents, is sound. And so how can we quit? How can we stop the sound situation from its point of use, first of all, which is great for the animals, great for the stress, and also great for our employees, then it also reduces the impact on the local residents. And so walk me through what we're planning on at this point in time, as far as working towards sound abatement, what those kennels are going to look like. Yeah. So they're labeled outdoor kennels, but they're actually split. They're 50 50. There's an indoor air conditioned area, and then there's an ability for that animal to choose its environment, whatever it feels the most safest. Maybe it'll be the inside. Maybe they'll go out to the outside. That would be during the day. They'll have the ability during the day, and I believe at all times, unless I'm incorrect. Okay, so, yeah, so that is inside we're going to have sound damping material. We currently don't be a CMU block wall with sound dampening material to stop and have those first and second reverberations adjusted before it dissipates out. Now, we've had two different community meetings out there. Each time we've shared which. That yellow circle, as you see on the concept diagram, that is a mathematical equation that if you had 115 decibels from the center of that property, that it will dissipate to 50 to 60 decibels at 1000ft. That's a 2000 foot diameter with no obstruction whatsoever. So we didn't count for the trees, we don't count for the buildings. So the next step to answer that question is to do sound mapping. So in our next phase, we start to understand where those buildings will be. We can do sound mapping,",

        "text": " and and I guess that gets back to the question of of your energy security study is that the basis of your actions and recommendations are based on how the company self assessed their risk if if that creates then how you prioritize s you were taking so now you know looking at this chart for liquid fuels winter storms in the Portland metro area be the top number one thing that you would be addressing in your strategies for risk mitigation compared to at least a step down for Cas yeah yeah um we have things to consider before that's done I appreciate and then keeping in mind 1567 is partnering with the EQ which Ser providing vulnerability ass going to well and they're taking these very seriously they that dat in to we the that interesting to see if if this is representative of how they how seriously they take their risks point to know is that inherent dist in the two efforts were evaluating for risk of spill and and I think this is focused at risk to service so even if we stop all this spill with the Hub nobody might be able to get to that oil that needs further attention Beyond this next after yeah and I think Max keeps saying this is our first go is going to be on we we are ining to ask compies to talk about you know what are their plans for continuing to operate after the earthquake they planning to build for that but we don't have authority to impose that or maybe they'll they want yeah we'll see okay are we ready to move on to our phase so we're going to enter now into the phase of risk mitigation measures as I mentioned early earlier what we're going to do here is I'm going to tee up a collection of risk mitigation measures and then we're going to give you guys time to prioritize so we'll probably spend more time getting you guys um time with slider or with those hard copies um then we will be talking to you or with you and so before we get into this we just want to remind you there is a relationship between cost and Effectiveness in general the operational costs um tend to be a little bit lower but also the effectiveness of those operational measures and then physical measures in general have a higher cost associated with them but can be quite effective and of course we have many measures that can fall along this spectrum from efficiency improvements um policy increasing Effectiveness some but maybe there's a time delay and getting those um active and then up to something like undergrounding and replacing pipes obviously quite costly but could be very effective it's just helping frame this and a reminder that this is something to considered and um as I mentioned before we're going to start with the high level all systems approach so looking at mitigation measures that could apply across all three sub sectors we're starting here with physical measures I'm not going to read all of this to you word for word um save everybody's time there I'll just highlight a few notes we're starting with drones so this is you know increasing our ability to inspect for example the midst an emergency we have three different um Options under redundancy on the right hand side with system segmentation so this is um subdividing that energy system so that when something is damaged we can isolate that damaged area and if you go down to the bottom we do have protect so of those five categories for the human caus threats the the category protect tends to have more um types of measures that are physical and naturing air gapping um limiting physical access or having restricted access to certain types of infrastructure that sort of thing and so we've included that here um under the physical measures for all hazards and so Chang it up for you here and we're going to head right over to slido there going to be two questions starting with question 15 so ranking the all systems mitigation measures related to a physical and then if there is a measure that's not included in that list and you feel like it should be that's your opportunity in question 16 to let us know about it if you're filling this out by hand just put a little number connect to the circle in your options under the question and that's how you can tell us um your ranking order so number one is the highest priority ranking again online particularly here if you can raise your hand when you're done with these questions let us know that um you don't need more time so for 1533 we've got 11 choices they should be number one through 11 yeah with one being the one you would priortize and on the hard copies there will be sub where they fill over to the next page check know um if you do have please of course do so um the slid will be open take take your copy and Som Ma I guess I go home enter you you could do that yeah um we on our team we were happy think we have this room we can stay here for another okay we'll keep here keep talking online same thing we'll still be e e we'll wait wait one more minute and we'll move on to the next section measures e okay so we're going to go ahead and move on to the operational measures so we're still at the all systems level so this high level these could apply to all of the sub sectors and we do have after Action reviews integration of artificial intelligence into different plans and monitoring the memorandums of understanding with the government so you know establishing those relationships those roles on the right hand side we do have several studies that are listed and on the very bottom we have maturity so this again is applying to those human C threats and the Adaptive measures of spy categories there just in general for human C threats should we be focused on maturing these adaptive measures and how it relates to these other operational measures so heading over into slido again you're on questions 17 and 18 now specific to operation measures for all systems it's going to be the same approach rank all of these or prioritize all of these in your perspective and then let us know if there's any medication measure there that you do think should that isn't present you should be added having heart about the last question sorry I know that I'm in chance but I what are you doing with our responses for that because I can't like my agency is huge and it's regional and we have different measures for parts of our system based on speak yes so I just answer it or this like what hand so do you feel like Consulting with other members of your team first would Beal I mean we have a hierarchy of but it's not I guess probably way as one especially with cost like undergrounding I mean to me I rank that last because even though it may the most effective it's clear the most expensive yeah it's some unrealistic um so I mean I guess I think you ask question how is it going to be used in this order can can you share what B's in your comments I you don't have to do that well we need to have another so I guess I feel like the question is um kind of simplifying it's making it too simp especially for all sectors I can't speak all right yeah so it's kind of um a restriction as part of this project right we have to simplify it in order to get started and state then scope of the project this as de I mentioned before this is a first step into an a document will be evolving over the years and changing if you don't feel comfortable ranking them here you know we're already going to connect we can talk through it with you guys specifically ganing enough information from you so that we can understand our Big Goal here is understanding what are the most pressing things that need need to be addressed in in the Portland metro area and so if it's not within this structure we'll talk and figure out you know what structure you're able to share that Insight with us right and we're we're happy to work with you on that show yeah because for us depending on the asset it's like well some stations have more physical transmission you know yeah all right I'm just putting it in your additional okay I have exact same obervation the systems are so complex even with things like what mitigation are and be on this that I just add discuss there's just to oversimplified and you know another thing to remember that these are public meetings folks like that are largely present in this room that have a lot of insight and Specialty knowledge as well as folks that maybe don't have a meeting and so it could be that you Des have so much which knowledge that we need to get and that's great we would love to spend more time with you if you're willing to share with okay so we'll see if this is detailed enough that you do feel comfortable ranking anything here um what we're it's going to be the same structure for the three sub sectors so here we're focusing on electricity this is getting into a little bit more detail so we've taken a subset of the um threats for this region we're looking at Cadia human CA threats Wildfire um in the feedback these um the large providers tended to express more opportunity for growth relative to the smaller providers and then we have wind and winter storm the um items in bold they directly fill a gap that we were able to identify based on the feedback from the affility companies and then literature view as well and so those are highlighted both just to draw your attention to it a little bit we do have physical on the top physical measurement on the top operational on the bottom and so what we're going to be asking you to do is rank these in those two categories again so ranking all of the physical measures it's across all the threats so we're wanting to understand across these threats which of these measures would you prioritize is most important and then doing the same thing for operational so I'll pop over to the questions real quick just to draw your attention to the number of questions that you're on so it's questions 19 through 22 your 19 and 20 are the physical prioritizing them entering any that we need to know about and then 21 and 22 are focused on the operational the first physical I take in the second part operation so I can leave it on this slide here if you want it for reference and give you a minute to work e e we are running a little over obviously so I'm going you about one more minute to wrap up and then we'll move on to let's move to the Natural Gas sub sector and so now we're looking at the threats of Cascadia physical attacks wildfire and Windstorm and again we have",

measures so here we're focused on human caused threats lightning Wildfire wind and winter storm and again divided by physical and operational measures you guys know the drill you're in the middle of it so for the very last section we're looking at questions 27 through 30 so let you guys work on these for a few more minutes and we'll just wrap up the the last few e e okay folks we have a few minutes left to wrap things up so you can keep working obviously if you're in the middle of it thank you so much um just want to let you know where we're headed next is um once we finish this road show the series of meetings to get the feedback that you guys are giving us right now we're going to compile all of that and organize our final risk mitigation measures that are suggested across each region and we'll obviously have a project roll out once all of that is finalized and there are a couple of last questions in the slido as you reach the end question 31 focuses on your region specifically if something wasn't highlighted here or the information presented didn't reflect a priority in your region please let us know and question 32 is just open-ended any comments or feedback that you have at all is welcome and question 33 is seeing what we can do or what Odo can do moving forward to meet your needs so you can give us um any responses on those open-ended questions as well and from here I'll hand it back over to Odo find cool thank you Casey um well thank you everybody as well for for helping us giving your feedback and your input I hope you found this you know useful um we really appreciate the input um you know we're trying something different on the pintable zoom meeting and trying to make it more interactive and gain your feedback so thank you very much for helping us uh so the very last thing that I'll um just want to present here is a plug for project uh it's Oregon Department of energy has many various Ventures and projects and efforts right now but we wanted everybody to be aware of um another one that's pretty significant that's just starting uh it's called the comprehensive State energy strategy uh and as you can see on the slide here Topline bul um House Bill 3630 the state legislature directs Odo to develop a state energy strategy identifying Pathways to achieve Oregon's energy policy objectives those policy objectives are mostly around decarbonization uh so that's another ongoing project um that's just starting right now uh I wanted to you know share this with this group we're sharing this with everybody we talked to to to um sort of if you're interested and engaging on that project effort um there are meetings that are just kiing off there A lot of information that's going to be produced um and so that's a a new Venture that we're undertaking you can see the very last bll it says energy resilience security Market implications part of the energy strategy will be influenced by our current energy security plan that we're working on right now um and I work closely with my colleagues in the um other half of our shop at the at Odo working on the energy strategy so we're we're constantly meeting and talking and coordinating uh and how our project the energy security uh will um help to inform the energy strategy and this very last thing about do you want to learn more about the energy strategy if so here's the information email web page uh a QR code you can scan with your phone and there's an upcoming webinar beginning of June to learn more if you're interested in that um in that project all right that's the end of uh pulled it up right on time uh we have a few minutes left here if there's any questions we're glad to feeli them now uh you're also there's a lot of information uh the slido stays open so if you want more time to um to work on that please do so uh that would be totally fine we'll keep it open for a few days I think is probably the what we'll do uh if you want to talk uh to me directly um that'd be great too here's my information Max Woods email phone Deanna there she is still in the room um and Tom Cecilia who's the third member of our team Tom's not here today uh but you can also contact us in many different ways so love to hear if there's more questions or input or concerns please give us a call uh we talked about the schedule for our project um earlier but just a reminder we will be delivering our product uh by the end of September to the fence uh Federal Department of energy uh we'll have a webinar just to roll out the results probably in September um of the project and we will kind of immediately get working on 2025 after finishing 2024 uh and sort of just roll right into all the work we we didn't get to um talk to perhaps more more folks we haven't talked to gather more information and and keep on working so thanks again um if there's questions Nows a good time uh like I said if not we have to just wrap it up here um you can always contact me directly after the meeting thanks than everybody Andre see any questions here yeah just one about the survey um do all the fields in the survey need to be filled in so you can submit or send if it's a required question you need to basically rank all the potential options to be able to submit a survey but everything else you can leave blank that has a star by right a star as here than those questions be answer and thank you so much for taking the time to rank all of them yeah thanks okay wrap this up thanks again appreciate it we'll be in touch",

        "text": " you sorry I keep talking please jump in no um so for that I was just going to say if you could also include in like looking at a policy if you could include um contract when the city contracts out so that's not as much Parks but it is more for like the other City buildings that contract out those Lawn Service type of uh program so if you want to look into that as well that is something that the client action plan has also expressed interest in so if you have that as part of your policy I would love to steal some of that from you Sor to jump I I think a few years back this council did adopt um not necessarily for landscape equipment but for City vehicles uh to replace them with electric vehicles and to do that and and they had a goal I don't remember remember the year to be honest by but by a certain year um with the intent of replacing City vehicles for electric vehicles um to address climate action plans and so forth I think some of the problem has been so the city has started that process in doing that where they've had the ability to do that I think similarly some of the process with some operational types of departments is having vehicles that are available that provide the same level of of um I guess service from that vehicle and that is not cost prohibitive um and being able to kind of do that so the city I know overall the city has started that process I don't but again I don't recall the maybe Juliana knows but I don't recall the day that the council was looking at you know ultimately the city kind of getting there but it's it's a work in progress even of the city with regard to to Vehicles an active work in process I guess so the city didn't adopt an actual goal because um it was cost but the the kind of two Factor test the city has is it being within a certain percentage difference of a basic gasoline or diesel vehicle and then it being able to perform the tasks needed by that work vehicle and that could be adopted as a right so thinking Debbie again about your committee right like you can make a policy say whatever we want right and so it could be a recommendation that there's a policy adopted that says hey we see a need for replacement schedules here and the replacement opportunity to replace with electric being predicated upon XYZ right and so taking into cost considerations taking in budget consideration taking in performance considerations because those are all going to be pros and cons and tradeoffs um on each one of those and so I think that's right I think those are all things for you to consider in the committee's uh deliberations and ultimate recommendation yeah thanks for clarifying that keyth because that's what I read here at least in the outcome uh portion says specific policies practices or changes on how things are done now um so yeah that's that I think that gives us some clarity on what our approach should be um so that being said though because it could be potential policies for the city I think it's much more important for that collaboration between the committee and and staff to really um come together to to evaluate current the current operation and uh with my background in in Contracting as a landscaper you know we're evaluating the you know the inevitable um uh you know uh equipment Shi to Electric so there's a lot of Technology that's there already but there's other factors right and but one thing is the contractor's operation to a city staff and parks management so there's uh subtle differences that um I'd like to get more uh Clarity on that way uh we can be responsible in um recommending something that's going to work uh for the initiative and for the staff to be able to still be produced yeah I think there's a lot of things that need to be understood that we can't just we don't want to just come in with a recommendation that says hey you need to replace all of everything with electric in the next 12 months right like that's that's not going to work uh that's not going to be good for anybody and so so yes so we need to understand what what factors are at least from my perspective nonetheless something needs to be identified so that it's not just you know undefined are we or are we not switching into electric in this case well well we're just gonna kind of make our best guess on whether it makes sense or not it needs to be defined as a process of where it makes sense what are we going to talk about what are we not so that there's the path yep totally agree and Al you had a thought fitting in with all this has anybody thought there might be possible to get a little bit of assistance from PGE and Salem electric and if we tell them the City of Salem is trying to switch to Electric engines in as many devices and vehicles and things that we can they might like the idea of us doing that and they might be able to do something to help us in some way I just think it might be worth pursuing PGE has helped with some of our electric vehical switching uh there to my knowledge there are no programs explicitly for tools it's there's a lot of information here especially what Debbie shared about the impact of two cyc engines that is not really good and they I think they'd be receptive to hearing something like that maybe assisting in some way it's good thought Al or Parks Oregon parks and recreation I think they have a Statewide policy for exactly this I think there's actually a o potentially that would mirror the Oregon State Parks and Recreation attempt to come off of gasoline in a certain timeline I know they got rid of two-stroke Motors quite a while ago and they were pushing for battery power operation but same thing as Mauricio was saying some of the tasks that both contractors they had uh inmate Crews as well as the normal Park Rangers were trying to attempt the battery power wasn't quite there yet this is in 2017 so they had to redo some of those Poli icies but I oprd might have a pretty cool maybe guideline or suggestion I just did a Google Search and I actually couldn't find it so if Deb you want me to like reach out to some of my friends who currently work for oprd I might be able to get my hands on something like that yeah I I know Joan um Joan and I both reached out to them uh we got a letter from them from about a year ago that they have transitioned a lot already and but they don't have as I know I talked to you about that in the past and they don't have as big of an operation at least not Salem is what we have here so it was felt that the equipment that you felt the equipment that they had maybe not may not be strong enough or long lasting enough for the parks that we the 91 parks that we have here but um but they were very uh willing to let us come out and look at things and you know talking them about how they did it they were getting uh electric vehicles and things like that and then Eugene I know that Joan reached out to them and we got some information from them and they transitioned by replacement you know they just would make it a policy that they had to repl with electric as long as it fell within a certain criteria and then as their budget allowed that's how they transition so you know there's all kinds of different ways like as weo uh they're transitioning by um Contracting so they will only contract with with people who have the electric uh capability for their Public Works and things like that so everybody's doing in a different way and that's part of the the resource identification which is the next one I was going to talk about if we want to move on to that one um because that one one there's e external resources and internal resources that Keith outlined and um I need a lot of help with the internal resources uh to find out where we're at like what has been our experience with um with electric equipment and you know where does it fall short how much do we have and um how do we how do we power it how do we do we have charging stations do we have the infrastructure do we have the the workflow be able to line these devices up somewhere and then when you go out to the site make you have three batteries because you won't last one one battery won't last so that's um kind of that internal resources but external resources there's just I've just read tons of examples like like a weo and um and Eugene and all and all kinds of different places how they're transitioning and how Portland is doing it how California is doing it by not allowing you to sell anymore basically no you can't sell that equipment anymore um two stroke engines are not allowing that sell yeah they're not allowing you to sell them in state you can still use them if you have them but you can't can't sell them anymore they'll just phase out themselves by by doing that so and then Portland is doing the phase in band which I think is a great idea where it's seasonal where you know when you have the wet leaves you can still use the powerful device but the rest of the year you really have to prioritize using the electric equipment so there's just so many different ways to do it and so I can find out a lot of the external Resources by you know by reading about it but I can't find out the internal resources about where we're at and what what are the problems we've um I did survey uh residential uh landscapers in uh Portland to see how they've adjusted to these are these are uh electric um they use they use almost entirely electric uh and what are the what are the good things they found what are the what are the bad things they found so I sent out a survey um and that's kind of the results is uh they they all use none of them have those big trucks that have uh uh uh solar panels and then you know there's some big companies that can do that and they charge them as they go but but all of these smaller companies use uh multiple Spar batteries and I went to a webinar and they talked about how really you have to you have to focus on having one company so basically you find a company like steel that you really like um and steel has you know really tough good ratings for commercial use and then you get you can buy all your batteries from them so you can interchange them and you buy all your equipment from them um and then they have warranties in",

        "text": " are being manufacturing for the sale off of this site. The only thing that we're selling off of this site is when these tree stumps come in, they're full of dirt. We burn them, they shake before we burn them, they shake them, try to break them up, get all the dirt out of them. And rather than just dirt building up and building up, building up, every once in a while, we've got enough dirt to sell a truckload of it, move it off of the site. So that's really the only thing that's being sold here. The ash from the incineration that is, is left behind is being used on this farm as an agricultural product for fertilization. So what's getting produced here is being used in ag production that falls under agricultural all day long. So if they weren't being paid to take this material onto the site, we could be incinerating all day, taking that ash and spreading it for fertilization under the right to farm, because that's what we're using the product for at the end of the game is for fertilization. So when you look at it that way, you can say, hey, this does fall under ag to some extent, but I'm not gonna. There's no way to stand here and be so ignorant as to say there's not an industrial component of this, because there is, but they're doing it the right way. And one of the things is, if we don't allow this in this region, because we are serving, as the question was asked, we are primarily serving the Marion Oaks region for both new construction and existing homes that have tree trimming that's occurring. And as more and more of it gets built out, the more and more of it's going to shift over to the maintenance of trees in that region and become tree trimming that comes in. If it's not done here, this material has to be hauled across the county. This is a transportation Relief act right here that we're asking for. We are trying to keep trucks off of the main roads. We're keeping them internal. They're already traveling the internal roads of Marion Oaks. The difference is we're going to travel the internal roads. We're going to leave the site, we're going to go onto the main highways. We're going to be passing underneath 484 and I 75, which we all know is a bottleneck right now, but they will all have to go right through there to go to the county dump, which is, as the crow flies, 14.4 miles. That's a direct shot. I don't know how many miles it is when you take the Google route or Google Maps or your iPhone, but it's going to be a lot further. But that's miles and miles on our public roadways that we don't need to do. This site was not complained about for two years because they're doing a great job of incineration. There's not smoke, there's not ash polluting everybody's yard and homes. Now, when we get, when we get down to the nitty gritty, we want to look at the entryway and the exit way, the one that has the houses on it, and restricting us to the roadway that doesn't have any houses on it. You know, that's something that we should discuss. There's some maintenance that needs to occur out there on some of those roads. You saw the pictures that are broken up. My client said, yes, we don't have any issue with doing the maintenance to those roadways because it is the large trucks that are breaking those up. We recognize that. So I'll be honest, I've never had a group of people come out and support much of anything that I come and speak on. And this, at the PNZ hearing, I had seven or eight people show up that were in favor of this because of the need and the fact that they know they're going to have to travel all the way across the county to do this. We presented, I had a map that had several locations that they could go to, but it turns out I was wrong about those places. Won't accept, you know, won't accept debris from outside vendors. So they were, you know, a couple of them were private locations that only serve, you know, for their own tree clearing and tree removal purposes. So there's a limited number of locations that can go. We're not doing grinding on site. You know, the loudest thing we have is the incinerator. We don't have any issues with putting up the berms to help block sound. But like I said, the biggest. How do you do a two year trial? Nobody knows about it. You show up, you make application. All of a sudden I got a code case right after I make application. I mean, we waved our hands and said, hey, look at us over here. When we got a code case. So, I mean, we. I think they're doing a good job. It's an absolute need. I mean, it's similar to sand mines. You need to have them within certain regions. This is an absolute need based on their history. I would ask that you all would please grant them this zoning so that we can continue this in the region, to serve this region. If there's any specific questions you've got about it, I will be happy to try and answer them. I'll also point out that we divided the parcels out where we were going to do this zoning. They're more than 300ft from any parcel that belongs to anybody else besides my owner. But we still got notified for every parcel that touches our full 2600 acres. And when you see how many people came out today regarding the fact we notified everybody touching 2600 acres, this isn't a problem. This is. And it's a true need. So I would ask that you would please approve us. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for the applicant's designee? If not, thank you. Mister Tillman, before you sit down, did I hear you correctly? You don't have any problem with the maintenance? I guess it's 163rd. That's correct. That was broken up that you saw in the photos? Yes, sir. We're fine with doing the repairs and maintenance to that. Okay. And I will point out that we do have water management district permits for pumping of water, you know, to be able to do dust control on the site. And we also did make application for FDP permit. They're correct. The only outstanding issue as far as the DEP permit would be concerned is having the correct zoning in place to allow this use. How many trucks do they run? Typically it's around 100 per day is about the maximum they see. What's the hours of operation? 07:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m. okay. And do it's also mentioned to also create higher berms. We don't have any objection to that. That wouldn't be anything I would ask. I see. On the conditions there was north, south, east, west, you know, all the way around. I think we should only be Birming where we're anywhere adjacent to something that's residential within 500ft. I don't think we should be Birmingham all the way around our site Birmingham from ourselves at all. So I would like for it to primarily just be on that. East side is where we place the berms. Yes, go ahead. Commissioner Tracy, when we met yesterday, was there something left off the conditions regarding the air curtain or commissioners? I believe that staff can speak to that. That we want to look for the permit conditions to be maintained with the outside agencies and that those best practices are utilized. If there's a problem with those permit conditions, then while we don't oversee those permit conditions, we would want the board to have the authority to revoke or readdress that conversation in the future if it was needed. We've got to meet the air quality criteria of FDP or FDP pulls our permit. So, I mean, we don't have any problems with. Very good. Anything else. Okay. And we will take public comment. And I have one person who has signed up, Mister Henry Munozhe. If there is anyone else who would like to speak on this item, I will invite you to come forward after Mister Munoz. Mister Munoz. Name and address for the record, please. Henry Munoz. 495 Marion Oaks Boulevard. The biggest concern I have is the roads. If he said that for two years, there's been no smoke complaints, though, once in a while we'll smell something, but no big deal. The roads is the problem. Okay. 165th is the main drag going into there now. He said he's just dealing with Marion Oaks, but the thing is, if he's just dealing with Marion Oaks, doesn't make a difference if it's coming in, outside or anywhere else. He's. He's riding the manor. Marion Oaks manor. He's riding Marion Oaks Boulevard. And of course, Marion Oaks Lane. And those, most of those of county roads, which means you guys have to repair them. Okay. The biggest one that we're stuck with in Marion Oaks is 100 6560 5th Lane Road. And then I just found out 133rd street. That'll fall upon our community to make sure that we fix them up. And I don't want to do that unless they're willing to pay for the fixing of those roads. As far as your county roads, I don't want you guys wasting a penny. You need to make sure that you're protected, too. Mister Munoz, again, can you give us those road numbers again that you're concerned about? 165th Lane, road, lane, road. And then he just mentioned 130, 3rd 160. That's where I was getting a little tripped up. Okay. Mister Munoz, I can guarantee you that if they",

to that one um and if you continue to have transmission questions or comments add them to the chat and we can try to address those all at once towards the that's right yeah the rto uh topic you know relates certainly to transmission so i think i think it's german this item too so um i'm just gonna you know introduce um rose we're gonna have an update from oregon public utility commission on oregon investor owned utilities that's an acronym there are relating to floating offshore wind and the hydrogen topic that we've heard a little bit about today so rose anderson is a senior economist with the oregon public utilities she works on regulatory activities involving the ious the investor and utilities she's been working on pacific or energy resource planning and procurement activities for several years he's also been engaged with idaho power's resource planning activities so rose i will turn it over to you thanks jason i hope you can hear me okay i'm i'm happy to be here today and to share a quick and very general report with you all on what a few oregon investor-owned utilities are doing in utility planning and procurement processes to consider floating offshore wind and some hydrogen resources as well i'd like to begin with our six state electric utility with significant transmission resources pacificorp in the pacific or rfp it's currently ongoing at the oregon puc that it and it's a procurement process that may result in the addition of about 2 000 megawatts of wind solar and storage there will be an analysis of loading offshore wind in the rfp but the details and parameters are really yet to be that's a conversation that uh staff and pacifico will be having over the next few months we hope and we're hoping that a study can look at the economics of adding offshore wind to the company's resource portfolio after and how that might inform consideration of the rfe resource we hope the details of that analysis can be decided by november 2022 in pacific court's 2023 irp this is a long-term resource plan that's looking to create a portfolio of resources to meet load over about the next 20 years and it's the development process for this irp is active now the march public input meeting explored potential supply-side resources such as offshore wood floating offshore wind will be a supply-side resource that can be selected to be part of a preferred portfolio for what i believe is the first time in this and supply side resource modeling is not yet finalized so the cost and operational details used to model floating offshore wind haven't really been announced opuc staff is going to seek to make flexible hydrogen load a topic of discussion in the irp lead-up process and to ask for large flexible loads to be considered in irp analysis on the transmission side for pacificorp as i think we've talked about here today uh there's some more work needed to assess any transmission upgrades that might be needed to connect floating offshore wind in the irp uh it is my understanding and i'm not an irp analyst of the company but uh in order to accurately model the floating offshore wind i believe there will need to be some estimate around any transmission upgrades that might be needed and that's really because the irp model tries to accurately portray the system and its costs and that helps it calculate a least cost least risk portfolio um in local transmission planning a study has recently been requested to look at floating offshore wind and the transmission that's needed to reliably connect varying amounts of it off of the oregon coast as well as the effect positive or negative that it may have on transmission system costs and moving on to portland general the development process for the next pge irp is currently underway supply side resource options were a topic of discussion at the november 2021 irp roundtable and floating offshore wind will be a supply proxy resource that can be selected in this irp as part of our preferred supply side resource modeling is currently underway and the cost and operational details used to model floating offshore wind have not been announced yet in the current pge rfp staff and pge are currently discussing the possibility of floating offshore wind and or flexible hydrogen load and this would ideally look at a scenario where floating offshore wind and hydrogen are included and compare it to one where they're not included and kind of assess the impacts on the rfp if i could move on and maybe any questions could be answered after i'm finished with uh northwest natural the the most recent full northwest natural irp was the 2018 irp and this was a while ago and a few things have happened in the hydrogen space since then in the 2018 irp hydrogen was considered as a supply side resource but it was really only modeled in one location at the mist storage and it wasn't selected as part of a preferred portfolio but it was initially selected as part of a deep decarbonization kind of sensitivity and in the northwest natural upcoming 2022 irp hydrogen will again be a supply side proxy resource that can be selected as part of a preferred portfolio there there's already been a study on hydrogen and some discussion took place at the march 2022 technical working group meeting the irp development process is ongoing and modeling details are not yet and that is all for my update today thank you very much thanks rose there was one question for you in the chat before i'm moving over to jason and also welcome other you know questions for rose's presentation how might offshore wind show up in the utilities hb 2021 compliance plans that's a great question we are currently in the midst of a process to kind of unroll how we'll be considering hb 2021 uh we have a docket number for it it's 2225 i believe uh so i i can't speak a lot to how that's going to play out but i will say that um getting floating offshore wind into consideration and utility long-term plans irps is a really excellent first step to to getting them considered also for hp 2021. great thank you and i'll say um that your colleague kim added a little bit more in the chat as well so thank you for that thanks um i'm not seeing anything else specific um in the chat uh free rose anyone um on the phone or on the webinar that like to raise their otherwise i know jason has a few more slides related to this topic if you're able to stick around rose for a few more okay um jason why don't you um go ahead to the rest of the slides on this topic and then we can kind of take questions on all of them at the end hey thanks so much rose um that was great to hear um what what the oregon utilities are up to um and thinking um so shifting back did i skip a slide i uh i must user error i usually start i start um by summarizing the questions that we asked i think that was an oversight on mice on my end so um but the topics that we're talking about here are energy markets um i can't remember the question numbers in the prompt and question document maybe i did have a slide and it just just got deleted in translation we've been combining a lot of slides over the past couple days um to bring you bring you all these great guest presenters today so um but the general themes are you know energy markets um who's going to buy who's going to invest who's going to off take you know off taker is kind of energy jargon for a purchaser or in an energy project so it becomes pretty critical um when you've got projects of the scale which some of the commenters certainly remarked about so gigawatt scales of floating offshore wind are too costly and risky for a single moderately sized utility to procure so a lot of the comments kind of came down to sharing the output identifying sharing sharing output as a path forward to kind of address that that issue of it being too costly for for just one person to go too costly and too risky potentially for for one party to go at it alone multiple oregon off takers are necessary with potential for washington california off takers as well kind of highlighting again the regional nature of this hydrogen producers could also be off takers potentially mitigating some amount of transmission and then this is another topic that there's been some back and forth on whether it's a pro or con or where the benefits will ultimately lie so something to think about that several people raised was even with out of state off takers floating offshore wind would likely provide local oregon benefits in the form of increased power quality",

        "text": " whole movement looking at the value of of of energy efficiency to be incorporated into the cost effectiveness calculation that are not traditionally in the cost effectiveness calculation one of the acronyms we use here at odo for that is jedi crabber which kind of up with that in the chat but it's all the different acronym all the different kind of benefits that aren't included traditionally and then finally the um there's an idea of potentially uh dual contract tracks with with separate contracts for small and maybe a template that would help developers be able to make it through the process more efficiently and effectively that's it alrighty thank you alan and anyone else from group three that want to add anything to that um moving on to group four hey rob this is richie i tried very hard to get a non-odor group member to be a speaker and it didn't work so i will go ahead and do it take one for the team uh we talked about barriers around um interconnection can you there's a lot of sort of head nodding um there i think that really resonated um both in terms of cost as well as like backlog related issues in that and solution wise talked about how there needs to be greater and potentially some reform we also talked about an example about um smaller projects like a two megawatt facility that has a lot of benefits outside of potentially even the energy piece the example and it was mark if you wanted to share more about it was a really interesting project example they have a landfill that has the appropriate slope that could accommodate solar but without significant outside funding um there is not um interest among the utilities uh or developers to um develop that type of project and some of the reasons there is just the the cost of it um being a two megawatt project economies of scale i as well as right now um consumer owned utilities are sort of long on power and don't have um an articulated need for that power although there was some solution-wise potentially some interest um exploring something with pacific core down the line um because there might be uh some new transmission coming in nearby the the landfill so there's sort of the the barrier opportunity there um the other one that was of an area discussion was um needs around um and land use um and the that was both for um built environment so i think some of the questions around that one of the presenters brought up as an example for the city of portland but i think that extends outside of the city as well just in terms of having a better understanding of the opportunity in the built environment i think some of us might be familiar with that google maps tool that shows you about like where solar might be a good fit um but something that's more specific for oregon that incorporates more of the data to understand the opportunity in the adults environment was a solution there on the sort of permitting side and then for the barrier around articulated barrier around permitting and land use there was interest in better synergies with current science especially with agriculture and having a better understanding of how to allow for multiple use opportunities in places and so then i think the other one to um to note is uh interest in the third workshop so there's i think already sort of a tee up to this interest in understanding costs and rates and how we can do a better job of capturing um the potential benefits with jobs and economic development um having a better understanding of cobit firms um that might be involved in in projects what we could do to better coordinate data across government to understand those benefits better i welcome anyone else from work group four to add anything i missed mark maggie diane tom jessica all righty thank you ruchi um we're definitely starting to see a few themes emerge here so um sounds like we had some parallels in some of the groups and um group five can we hear from group i'm realizing i was a spokesperson for group five but i didn't take any of the notes so um hopefully folks from my group can chime we talked a lot about the land use restrictions um and um oops i have a little friend here um that is pestering me so not just wearing a lovely necklace she's a fighter um so not only the lame's restrictions when it comes to dual use agriculture as we talked about before but just in general um there are land use issues um in the that really restrict most of the willamette valley from small and we talked about interconnection challenges transmission challenges some of the permitting challenges um i'm kind of stuck on the challenges at the moment um can someone help me with the list of opportunities that we came up with we didn't take her um i will jump in here um we talked about um just in general we didn't narrow down our list so i'm sorry um we talked about dual use as an opportunity resilience reduction and transmission issues with localized projects standardizing permitting being an as well all right and my understanding was that we had five groups so there is no group six is that correct good well um yeah seems like um as far as some of the overarching themes go we heard from several groups about the need to try to monetize benefits that are not normally captured in rates which of course are really looking only at energy value and so we talked about that a little bit in group three as well the the need to try to recognize and ideally quantify those values and then figure out from a policy um how do they get um reimbursed and so that was something it sounds like we heard from several groups is the need recognize and um you know value these benefits that are coming from the small scale project so we will continue to noodle on that one and the next really is looking at benefits and so um i know benefits and opportunities blend together a lot um so we will continue to work on that one and i think we'll be able to to get somewhere in the next meeting as another one that we've seen in a lot of the groups is the the challenge around interconnection and i think that when you look at the amount of renewables that we're talking about needing to meet the goals in oregon and really throughout the west it's really developing projects at a that we haven't seen before and it's not megawatts anymore it's many many gigawatts and so the way that the interconnection piece i discussed at least a little bit in in three but maybe in other groups and just trying to pull that apart i think there some administrative barriers around interconnection but then there's also some genuine engineering around interconnecting the volume of renewables that we're going to need and it gets us to a discussion about new transmission and large substations in the right parts of the state to accept um energy from you know different projects i know that gets into the large scale stuff and we're talking about small scale but ultimately the system impact trickles all the way down even to the you know five kilowatt residential net meter project and so thinking about how this interconnection piece gets figured out both from an administrative and from an engineering standpoint i think it's something that we can formulate some recommendations around and we'll continue to work on that one we heard about permitting and a landscape of many different policies across the state municipalities counties policies that all um sometimes against each other to create a landscape where developers can go in and make projects happen without administrative burden around the also with land use we recognize that the the one land use goal that relates to energy goal 13 that land use goal was written in a time before we knew about renewable energy development and so when we when we get you know to this land use discussion i think one of the recommendations may be to look at those you know look at those those goals a little more closely so that's a quick sum up i don't know if anyone else has thoughts from the main takeaways for what it's worth so people don't feel like their thing got forgotten because rob didn't report it back i took notes on everything that i heard from every group and then like put if multiple groups had said it or whatever to kind of like distinguish so um and then we all took notes in the breakouts that will also get back to us so we can kind of use that to create key takeaways i think we just want to make sure that we captured some of the ones that were really obviously high level so if we missed something we have it i promise i um i know there's like this sort of i don't want to call it a cloud but there's this issue hanging out um where a lot of people are kind of writing me and talking to me behind the scenes and in the comments about wanting to circle back because pretty much every developer or developer ally on here had thought this rule on the dual use was a problem and then john said that wasn't so i think that um what i'm hoping we can do since we are a little bit now ahead of agenda somehow we've pulled off a miracle by shortness shortening the key takeaways part thanks rob um is maybe do public um so that we make sure that we have a chance to hear from the members of the public that have been waiting to have their turn and then any time that we have remaining after that we can kind of get back to that issue um if that works for people uh to just get clarification i think from john if that works um but give him a little bit of time to get ready for it i guess um so any does that work for people we did public comments and just kind of next steps and then whatever time we have left we can return to that issue great okay so um what i wanted to do here we what we already did was we elevated all of the attendees that are here as members of the public to panelists anyway so if there's anybody on the line that wants to give comment that isn't on the work group feel free to raise your hand just so i can keep it somewhat organized and then i'll call on people okay that was my comfort level with extended silence about 30 seconds but i don't see anyone one thing that i wanted to do since it hasn't come up one of our work group members had to leave early she told us from the beginning she had a conflict today and so um so that's allie from ally rosenbluth from rogue climate and she kind of wrote what some of her thoughts were on opportunities and barriers",

        "text": " to state law in California which includes the sea uh requirements um and I I will add that oh and then the Bureau of ocean Energy Management uh has just completed a handbook for offshore wind specific to Offshore wind which I think is easily adaptable to other energy projects including onshore wind um so those are all ones that you should be looking at um the other thing I'll say is having work with the FC uh manual a couple of times not not manual exactly but the rules uh it's wholly inadequate what what you've got right now is is really really inadequate um an example would be um on simulations uh simulation technology has changed quite a bit it's a lot easier to do than it used to be it's also a lot more exacting in terms of its standards than it used to be I mean I'm old enough that we used to do just handes and then wireframe diagrams and then um Photoshop um and now we have these um simulations that are photo realistic but they're still very limited in in uh how you apply them I just say for for FC is this is an issue that you really ought to look at very carefully probably imp panel uh a group of four or five uh visual resource experts to help you kind of walk through this and and find if there is a method that would best fit uh a quick recommendation would be the BLM uh methodology which I think is highly adaptable much more so than the forest service methodology is and by the way I used to work for the forest service and used to argue the exact opposite um so I was probably wrong then and I'm right now or else I was right then and I'm wrong now I'm not sure which but one of the things that the BLM has done is they more consistently upgraded their system because they've had a lot of energy proposals on BLM lands and that's kind of forced them to um adapt and there is a manual that they did for the state of Wyoming um which I will offline I will try to look up the title of and send it to you guys so you can it's downloadable it's free unlike my book which you would have to actually buy uh but the but the yomi manual is really good it it specifically addresses uh renewable energy projects and it goes through an entire best management practices um so I'll I'll send information on that along to you thanks thanks Dean and I believe we may have that manual saved in our records and if we do um I will make sure that that gets posted uh along with some of our yeah thanks RI you we next okay uh thanks Chris um and thank you Dean for all of that I think I need to get in touch with you um Chris you have all those manuals in your records in the B2 contested case if you don't have it in your uh staff office um I say that this is one of the most egregious rules that you guys uh really you you need to work on this you need consistency and even if it has some variability BLM lands Forest Service lands whatever you also have plenty of federal um manuals and methodologies to pick and choose from but my caution is with this is to still be extremely clear either if you design the your own FC one or if it ends up with different land uses to have different ones but being very very clear because right now in our personal experience for some of us who have been involved in this transmission sighting with the Boardman Hemingray transmission the problems that we have faced is that the developer is cherry-picked the it comes up with a methodology because you don't have a methodology even though it's supposed to be sufficient specificity blah blah there's no specificity in these rules therefore they can pick whatever they want and make a methodology so it looks all all great all very uh all this picking this from this one and this one and coming up with the methodology the problem is they cherry-picked it and have stuff from the farest service from the 1970s not even using the 1991 or 1994 version the BLM the older manual not the newer one and on and on and on and what I just have to say with all of this is that it it just is becomes totally meaningless it's not up to date um the right now the visual assessments that are being used are like you're driving in your car and you pull over to the way station and you look out once and you have one Viewpoint that's a key observation Point that's it nothing about as 1994 forest service manual talks about and in your NEPA little diagram too that landscape characteristic I mean what are we doing in Recreation areas nowadays riding bikes we taking hikes whatever what is the experience What is the characteristic of it it isn't just looking at it from some simple Viewpoint um with a peripheral view maybe your the the whole Scenic um and Recreation standard in particular when it comes to visual is I mean you might as well not have the rule you guys really need to to not land uh not Hammer this out there are a lot of good Federal resources that Wyoming manuals excellent Forest Service work is excellent and uh those need to be updated in part of your process and I like what Dean is saying and I'll provide you the resources as well but there'll be duplicates of Deans I think um but you you we this needs to be shed up that's all I have to say for right thanks thanks fji um Meg add your hand up next there um I agree with what Dean and Fuji have been saying and I just wanted to put in a plug as well for what I believe is the Argon National Laboratories visual impact assessment that may be part of the Wyoming study that's been mentioned and somebody else may have more information than I do but I believe it's Argan National Laboratory um yeah this is Dean and argon did uh did write that um Wyoming man great yeah so I would just refer to that as well and I think you know that the second question there regarding if the methods should be different for the different context like yeah I do think that there should be some flexibility in how these things are looked as opposed to saying you know this is the only way to do it rather you know as these people mention these different um visual impact methodologies do have their different strengths so if only we had the most perfect one that combined everything you know a pipe dream there um but yeah I think that there are these different um approaches and all of them do have their different strengths thank you thanks um Irene hi um okay I I support what's been said so far but um a few specifics here um I've heard multiple times at fsac meetings that there are no specific requirements for protected areas and it's up to council discretion what they decide so when you add that to the use of the word significant impact um and significant impacts have been things like building a wind turbine within a quarter of a mile of a wild and Scenic River where you can see the wind turbines from the water um it's been things like uh building a wind turbine you know and I've dealt a lot with wind turban within 50 feet of a a Oregon Trail ruts has been one uh proposed site certificate uh it just what is significant and I know there's a definition of significant but I can tell you the application of that term is is bizarre at times uh the other thing is I the use of key observation points what they're doing with that is using where where do the most people show up that's a really inappropriate way to evaluate something like a wild Scenic River or um or Oregon Trail areas you know where when you're talking about a natural environment or a natural um uh setting going to where all the people are going to be is not an appropriate approach to looking at Scenic values uh let's see what else I wrote down here WR down here I think that you there needs to be a specific process and it needs to um delineate exactly it needs to be measurable there's so much right now that is just subjective evaluation and there there really is no criteria for for Scenic uh issues I like uh the US Forest Service um information I like the BLM information and actually one thing I like in the OCTA is they Define if um if a structure is within a certain distance of a resource it's considered a high impact uh the and what I'm thinking of when I when I say that I think there needs to be some distance uh building a a a transmission line within 127 miles of a uh of the uh Oregon Trail interpreted Center is being considered as not a significant impact uh we need to do away with that kind of thing that kind of thinking anyway those are my comments and and I agree with everyone who says this rule is non-existent right now in terms of the way it's being applied um yeah I would say that so far it is safe to say that we've we've heard that uh most of you do seem to or most of the people at least that I've shared do agree that we we need some sort of method um and I'm wondering if we can hear from anybody uh maybe some of the energy developers of people that um prepare applications about you know if one of these uh if either we'll say that the forest service or the BLM methodologies would be more appropriate or are more commonly used for energy development um or if there would be any concerns about the council mandating use of of one of those methodologies or or adapting one of those methodologies for use in the upset process and maybe while you're thinking about that Fuji I did see that you're so go ahead very well folks are thinking about that I just want to correct Irene it wasn't 100 25 miles from the interpretive center it's 125 ft it's just that's okay but uh um I think if there was to be still some variability in the methods I'm not comfortable really with that but that at a minimum they should stay the most updated uh manual um when I'm talking about cherry picking I'm talking about you know things that I'll just say it Idaho Power has used in the board Hemingway uh analysis so we'll go for 1974 in the forest service we'll go to 19768 I mean it's 86 and the BLM blah blah blah so it needs to be the most updated if you're going to use those resources and then this term of significant as Irene is talking about even if you use well or the the bl",

We'll start tonight with our work session, and so thanks to those who are foregoing a little bit of sunshine this evening at our farmers market and are joining us. So with that, I will turn it over to Robbie Hammond. Thank you, mayor. Good evening, everyone. Tonight we have actually two work sessions scheduled before city council simply because both of them are fairly quick. If we don't get through the second one all the way, we can always extend it past the regular city council meeting. So the first meeting we have first work session today is Robin Strong is going to be providing us with our climate action plan update. So I'll turn it over to Robin. Thank you, Robbie, and good evening, council, and thank you for having me to join you tonight. My name is Robin Straughan. I use she her pronouns, and I work in the city manager's office as the sustainability and resiliency manager. I'm going to walk you through a pretty brief presentation, but I will have plenty of time for your questions if you have any questions. And as I just shared with the mayor, I am the lead in this area, but I am not the expert on all things climate. So I do have my note paper here to take down questions that I may not be able to answer, but I will try to answer whatever I do know. So here's a quick agenda for my presentation. I'll share background on the city's climate planning work to set the context for you. Next, I'll review the timeline for the development of the city's climate action plan. Then I'll discuss the data and projections for greenhouse gas emissions specific to Hillsboro. I'll share the engagement and outreach activities that we have done so far to support this climate work, and I'll wrap up with other climate related projects and programs underway at the city. And feel free to stop me any time if you have any questions. So here's a visual depiction of how the climate planning work fits into the bigger picture of the city's work. So the climate action plan was initiated last summer as a way to comprehensively address climate change in our community. Our climate is changing as we've seen with more extreme weather events and prolonged heat waves. We're expecting one this weekend, so hopefully you're all preparing for that. So this plan will document how the city will reduce our contribution to the problem, as well as help our community adapt to the changing climate. So the climate plan was one of the recommendations of the city's environmental assessment. That assessment was completed by Portland State University in 2022 and defined key environmental and natural resource recommendations for the city. The assessment work is one of the city's environmental sustainability priorities and is now incorporated into the city's new strategic plan. And the strategic plan is one of the city council's priorities to help keep programs, projects and all the work that the city does on track and accountable to the city's mission, vision, values and goals. So this shows a timeline of the climate planning work indicating some of the key milestones in the process. And keep in mind, this is a two year project, so we're about halfway through the plan process to date. So in the next few slides I'll spend a little bit of time on each of the projects we have completed so far. Those have check marks on this page. So I'll share a recap of the Kennedy Greenhouse gas inventory and also show a forecast that I haven't showed to you before of the greenhouse gas emissions for our community. I'll go over the stakeholder workshops we hosted and I'll share the GHG mitigation measures we are considering, as well as an overview of the city's climate change page. And the work that's still ahead of us includes a specific look at the benefits of our greenhouse gas reduction strategies on low income and disadvantaged communities, an assessment of the workforce needed to complete the measures we want to do, development of climate adaptation and climate resilience strategies, and gathering input from our community. So we'll also be working on the development of the plan documents, which will include city operational strategies and climate goals. We're currently aiming to bring the plan to council for review by next summer. Are there any questions on the timeline? Okay, so this chart provides an overview of the community community greenhouse gas emissions inventory showing where the biggest sources of emissions are. In Hillsboro, we know that greenhouse gas emissions are and the burning of fossil fuels are responsible for climate change and warming our planet. So as a reminder, I presented the full greenhouse gas inventory report at the council work session last December. So this is just one slide recap of that longer presentation. So just a quick snapshot to remind you of where we are with our emissions. So on this chart you'll see the blue, yellow, green, yellow and orange bars represent our local emissions. So local emissions occur directly in the community or nearby due to activity in the community. The energy used in our buildings, primarily electricity and natural gas and transportation energy which includes gas, diesel and electricity for our EV's are the largest locally generated emissions. Industrial processes is next, and waste which is so small you can hardly even see, the bar is the sector with the lowest amount of emissions in our community. So the magenta bars, or they're kind of like dark red on the screen, are the city's imported emissions. Those are items which we use within the city, but that were grown, manufactured, or otherwise created outside of the city limits. So that includes upstream fuel production, household consumption of food, goods and services that we bring into our community or order online, and air travel. So while local emissions include specific aggregated data from our partners, imported emissions are estimated, however, they are significant. And if you stack all those magenta bars up, they are actually our largest source of emissions. So we want to keep them as part of the climate conversation. So we will be proposing some strategies in our plan to help reduce them along with measures to reduce local building and transportation, energy, or other two big sectors. Question, Rama. Thank you. So the goods and foods and beverage are they also counted for the greenhouse gases they generate in the communities where they're made. So it's almost like they're counted twice? No, they would be counted separately. So if there's emissions generated during the production of, say, our agriculture products, that would be counted in the fuel used to farm the products, and therefore you would find that in transportation or if they were warehousing and that type of thing, otherwise actually developing food, that would probably be in our building energy because that would include kitchens and restaurants that cook our food. Does that make sense? Yeah. So the idea is to minimize the double counting. Those are, you know, when you talk, when we talk about food and beverage, it's not like what's grown in your local community garden. It's like those bananas that we're bringing in from, like, South America. Got it. Any other questions on this? It's kind of a big, the big picture. So I just want to make sure we're all clear on this. Okay. So this is a chart that I haven't shown, showed you yet, but this is looking specifically at the local emissions in Hillsboro. And this is a good chart. This shows that they are expected to decrease over time thanks to strong climate action from the state of Oregon in the building, energy and transportation sectors shown here in the dark blue and green toward the bottom of the graph, for instance, electricity emissions are required to be reduced by 100% by 2040, which dramatically decreases the greenhouse gases associated with operating commercial and industrial buildings, plus our homes. So note that this projection assumes that the state's climate protection program, also known as the CPP, prevails following a court challenge and new rulemaking process that is underway right now, I think DEQ hopes to get that done this year. If that program holds, it will also reduce emissions from the natural gas and sector and other stationary fuels significantly, which is shown in the light blue bar, kind of in between the blue and the green. So while emissions are estimated to drop over 70% in 2050 compared to 2022 local emissions without any additional mitigation actions from us, that is still not enough to hit the target of 100% ghg emissions mitigation to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. That's the dashed line. That is the international target for limiting the worst impacts of climate change. So additional goals and actions beyond current projections and legislation will be modeled as part of our community climate action plan so we can try to help meet that target. So you may note that imported emissions are not included in this forecast. Primarily. This is because changes in imported emissions are very challenging to track and predict. So therefore, this snapshot just shows our local emissions. Are there any questions on this emissions outlook for Hillsboro? Yeah, so thank you so much. I think my question is about the hills, the state plan. So that's currently under rulemaking and currently challenged in the court right now, the climate protection plan. And that is specific to the natural gas and stationary fuel sector. So that doesn't have anything to do with the requirements for electric utilities to reduce their or to decarbonize their systems. It's a different sector. Okay, so then the target is what you're saying through all of our energy requirements as a state. That's why it goes down to zero. And we're predicting industrial process and product use to stay roughly flat. Well, there's, there's no specific, you know, laws that are driving that down at this point. So this is just modeling what's on the books for state of Oregon laws. I think there are some federal laws reducing a little bit in terms of, like, reform refrigerants, but that's not, we use some specialty processes and products here in Hillsboro, and there's nothing specifically driving",

        "text": " much of oregon's electricity consumption comes from in-state generation nearly 100 of its fossil fuel use both from the transportation sector and electricity generation is imported all right do we have any other questions yes cindy yes thank you thank you for the presentation to both of you can you go back to the um medusa looking graph with you i like that we should call it medusa there you go um i and i want to make sure that i'm reading it properly the waste energy so on the left hand side it's energy produced or imported and if we follow those lines through so there are 736 btus wasted is that am i reading that right yes so that includes everything from the the point of production all the way through so if you think about kind of every step on this chart there's there's losses along the way that results in that waste energy and a lot of it is heat so we think about like a natural gas generator they they actually spend a lot of energy working on how to cool down their system in order to continue producing electricity so they use water as a coolant often taken by a and then run that up to release heat into the air using cooling vents to get that water down to a low enough temperature that they can return it then to the stream and then pull more cold water in to cool their plant as they go and all that heat that's being produced that doesn't create electricity is lost in the process the same thing happens in industrial and um even residential applications um it's easiest to understand with combustion and then it's a little bit more complex in things like solar um but it's kind of related to the you know how much uh solar actually hits each panel um versus how much is actually transformed into electricity for use so every resource has a efficiency rate uh when it's being transformed into electricity and then even when your electricity is powering something in your house there's an efficiency rate there as well yeah i would say i would follow up when then you know i think the most uh probably the most tangible way to think about this is that bottom right here in hand section there transportation think about your vehicle uh gasoline engines are quite inefficient really right so if you look at the amount of petroleum going into your transportation consumption it's a small fraction frankly that is actually transmitted to use usable energy that actually moves your vehicle a lot of is wasted because it's a pretty inefficient uh process so um we can benefit from that a little bit some of that some of that inefficient heat loss we use to heater the cabin in the car on a cold winter morning like today but um but yeah that's uh it is kind of it is kind of striking when you see it on this kind of macro level just the scale of our inefficiencies in our energy system yeah as i said it's seventy percent is wasted is that seventy percent life cycle on a la yeah from a cradle-to-grave from production through final consumption and in in order to look at the just the electricity side of it and take out is it would you just take out that bottom uh you know subtract that piece to find what the electricity generation waste is yeah and i can give you a rough ballpark of that um it tends to be better than the transportation sector um averaging in the high 30 percentage to the low 40 percentage depending on the resource um for so for efficiency in energy okay thank you right you can look at efficiency losses at each one of these steps too right from production to consult you can kind of go down the chain and every time you're losing right so when you start to add it up at the end you know a lot of times when you think about energy efficiency we're really thinking about like that dark blue little box in the center residential consumption right more efficient widgets in our house or or more efficient uh and building envelopes but there's really inefficiencies through the whole process from production to generation etc um and i don't want to sign stephanie from our work but i thought maybe there was some conversation of breaking this out just for the next for the next energy report to look at just the electric sector and just i i heard some talk of that i don't over promise but i think that maybe is uh we're scoping that right now for the report so i will take that note adam uh perry did you have something you wanted to add yeah um oh excuse me did you have something oh okay um i had a kind of a a question with charging this grid the electricity so how are you coming up with an n number for what come up off the grid versus what come onto the grid to make this graph that you have ah that's a that's a great question so our consumption numbers for electricity come directly from those utilities so that is actually the summation of the at the meter charges for all of their uh all of their points of supply so it's based upon what the utilities actually charge customers for um which is electricity being used uh so if we do have electricity that gets wasted in the system that's been generated but has nowhere to go because they're not ramping down fast enough not dropping off um then that is not reflected down in the the sector so we actually don't know what was used whether it was nuclear biomass solar i see i see what you're getting at yeah and adam might have a better answer for me but i like to think of the electricity electricity system as kind of like a spider web right it's very interconnected there's a whole bunch of routes and pathways and when electrons are put onto that network they go to the nearest need um at least physically like what actually happens um but accounting wise utilities make contracts um in advance and they plan to sell certain amounts of electricity and they they promise we're going to put x amount of electricity on the grid and we're not going to and we're going to use x amount of electricity in planning so the actual like written accounting for where electricity goes of course does not exactly match where electricity actually goes there's really no good way to really track where this electron of hydroelectricity actually gets used so this graph is basically an assumption it's the it's the best assumption we can make based on the available data yes okay thank you chair grail i have a question this is kent yes ken i really appreciated this presentation it's been uh really interesting and i'm trying to figure out about the all the direction right now is the automobiles of the future are going to be electric i'm wondering about when i'm looking at this graph right now petroleum is the main thing for transportation that goes in there and it's amazing how much of it's wasted and i guess it's the very bottom little line there that's all that's needed for out of the petroleum industry am i reading that right and and so that the electric would need to basically replace that bottom line and there's a pretty good amount already there so we need to is it all that we need to do is like double the amount of electric energy production and we could do away with the petroleum yeah i think your own dose something there and actually let's see how quickly i can i don't want to give you a whiplash backtracking here but um it really it's right here right um don't even need to quite double it right so this is showing you 2050 uh economy-wide decarbonization we definitely have to grow the electric to my eye that's not quite doubling right it's probably a you know 40 or 50 increase or something it's a significant increase but it's not even doubling and you know there's some other visuals i didn't include here that really show just how much more efficient electric engines are then internal combustion engines on a btu basis it's quite striking to see how much less we would need for an entire electrified fleet compared to a fossil based fleet on a bpu basis it's it's something like 20 or 30 percent of the btus for the same amount of energy because it's so much more efficient undertaking i don't want to undersell it we still have a huge undertaking to uh uh you know ramp up besides the electric sector and decarbonize it to provide that this increase you're looking at here um but yeah overall to be total btu on an energy basis that will look quite different that sankey having mentioned the distribution system needed to to make that happen as well thank you any other questions yeah this is handling can we go back to the spiderweb it's everyone's favorite okay so if we're moving from left to right we're importing 784 trillion btus is that correct that's correct includes petroleum natural gas coal and a little bit of nuclear and biomass and we're only exporting 88 million a trillion btus so a big part of the import is the and we're importing natural gas and it shows that we're exporting some hydro but very little uh natural gas in other sectors so i you know that's it's pretty dramatic i think the difference between what's being imported versus what's being exported yeah and you know in our energy report maybe stephanie remembers the number of hand but i want to say it was about four billion dollars a year oregonian spend out of state to import fossil fuels predominantly for our transportation it's uh quite a large uh chunk of money significant both in terms of financial and as you see carbon impact because our primary primary sources of emissions for the state are coming from those three resources at the bottom the coal natural gas and did i see your hand again perry noah got answered thank you yeah this is haley again it would be interesting to see this just for all right i will bring that back to the team as i said we're scoping our report um right now so i will i will propose it to the team and share that there's a lot of interest thank you thank you any final questions or comments for adam or stephanie this is ken i would just say uh it's been a fascinating presentation and todd thank you very much for getting these folks uh to do this for us some of these questions came up and and you know i don't feel comfortable answering answering them other than a very very generic way so you know we've got experts you basically heard from to the experts at the agency so i just want to say thank you guys very very much this has been tremendously helpful hopefully for for council certainly for staff because you know it helps us understand a little more broadly you know how",

        "text": " probably rule making would be the better way to do it because then you would have it you know more clearly established on the record with the language but also with the rule making history so i'm going to go back to patrick to you know probably either validate or alter anything that i yeah that that's a a great description i think todd i i think it's you know essentially note when you see it i don't have the case lot at my fingertips i'm sure i could find it's probably some case law though i could provide find examples but unfortunately i don't have that for you now one thing that comes to mind would be if if someone was entitled to notice for example if they had put their name on the uh the list of the persons that request notice of uh f second department actions and for some reason the department did not provide them that notice even though they had asked for it that would be good cause uh you know it's simply not looking uh you know knowing that you know fsec does regular business but not staying up to date to it i personally wouldn't consider that good cause but uh it's it's something that rule making really would be best so you could put some parameters on it absent that we don't have that right now a good cause standard is essentially what would a rational person consider to be a good reason uh for not having provided comments by the deadline this is marcy thank you patrick um i just want to clarify so you have a spokesperson but that person was not available or just right he wasn't available to be here no i i guess i don't mean that like that you're so you said you're on a board so you're not the only person and we have we have some people that are looking at fsec and they had we thought that this is a precedent setting uh in our county and so it was important that uh we could probably should have paid a little bit better attention to it but the person that was doing the oversight it slipped through their and we we thought we were and we just found out about it too late and i'm understanding that i didn't even know that i would be allowed to speak at all today so thank you for your time thank you for the clarification other council members yes and the record and buyer i agree with hanley that there is enough timeline built into our process for public comment and i'm generally supportive of more common public comment is better but in this case there have been i'm afraid of granting any sort of special exception to that because i think that without rule making blows out the timelines completely and changes the process from what's in the statutes and administrative rules so i'm pretty uncomfortable changing those rules without anything specific and if that's something if this comes up often and i don't know if this comes up often maybe consider rulemaking in the future if this is an exception to what generally happens process wise then rule making probably isn't needed but um i support hamley's position thank you go ahead jordan for the record this is precedent setting it may be but our actions also could be precedence setting or altering down the so without a clear definition other than a gut feeling of good cause i would agree with the rest of the council too or with hamley's comments and everybody else at this point thank you marcie this hanley again um i want to make be very clear that this council met in pendleton to have these hearings so i think we provided substantial opportunity participation by actually meeting in it was our first in-person meeting um in two years find an effort to hear all concerns thank you um perry just want to make sure if you had anything to add i think everyone else has spoken yeah um i'm good with the rest of the council on i think we better watch what we do because this could open the door for larger issues in the future we need to uh set a clear path forward and going outside our parameters is not actually doing that so i agree with hanley thank you perry so todd just procedurally i think everyone has spoken and i think we unanimously don't agree that we should extend the time the record todd cornett and i think that then um puts it back into uh alj triana's um sort of purview i think ultimately uh because she's the presiding officer it's her decision on this but she was seeking you know any kind of guidance or or i think uh you know interest by the council on this but i think and somebody else wants to clarify i believe then it goes back to you um your honor okay thank you um so hearing nothing else i think my understanding is that the the council's declining to set a good cost standard at this point uh but has indicated that maybe that's something that they're going to look at in the future and i looked over the laws and rules prior to this meeting and i see nothing in there that would allow me extend the record absent having some sort of good cause standard so i am going to deny the request uh to allow the comments from blue mountain alliance bma uh so while those comments are part of the um you know they've been obviously been sent to the department they won't be considered a public comment uh and therefore that request is denied um and so since both of those uh emails were from the same party that issue i believe is wrapped up all right so moving on this hearing is intended to provide the applicant the opportunity to present their response to comments uh received at that prior meeting either orally and or in writing i do understand that on june 15th of 2020 the applicant provided a supplemental response to issues raised on comments received does the applicant have any other written materials to be submitted at today's hearing uh excuse me matt martin with capital power uh no um and then are you um interested in presenting any sort of oral comments at this meeting uh yes i appreciate the opportunity to summarize what we submitted on june 15th and welcome any questions okay and is it going to be just you presenting oral comments or will you have anyone else from applicant uh tim mcmahon with stole reeves the council for the applicant will will fill in uh anything that i miss okay great uh go ahead whenever you're ready great so um again matt martin with capital power uh nice to see everyone in person and uh appreciate this opportunity to speak with you today so i just wanted to summarize the um the that came to you on june 15th it's a response to all of the various questions that came up on the goal 3 exceptions analysis at the may 26th hearing and so you know it's a lot of material hopefully you've had a chance to read through it and i just want to kind of summarize it at a high level what was submitted why was it submitted and and you know effectively why we think it's a compelling reason for the council to grant us the goal three exception there were really three questions um in 85 pages here we answered three questions but um the first one was whether the solar lands are you know a significant or substantial portion of the landowner's overall the second one was you know why this particular land why was this land chosen and the third one was you know how does this land compare to other lands in the area within um not just the project area but outside in umatilla county so we'll take those in that order as part of the package we did have written testimony um or a declaration from two of our uh main landowners bob levy who's not here today and steve corey who is here today if you have any questions on that testimony but you know i think they're um their testimony speaks for itself but i'll go into a little bit a little bit of detail about it and i think that's important because in terms of how or these solar lands being a substantial portion of their property the way that the application was written it was a bit narrow in the sense that it only spoke to the the four parcels of land that this solar project is on in reality they own a lot more land within umatilla county and the surrounding counties and i think that's you know what the first item is it's just clarification that this is not 37 this solar project which takes up 1900 acres is not 37 of their overall agricultural land they have almost 75 000 acres of of agricultural land sorry of land and and i think it's 28 000 of agricultural land so this 1840 acres is 6.6 of their agricultural lands and we don't feel that is substantial um which the landowners can speak to and and is within their so the second question which i think is the most important and what the declarations really speak to is why did we pick this particular parcel and you know this this project started as as just a wind farm and over time we expanded to include the solar lands this decision was made a few years back to make this more of a well-rounded facility in terms of being able to produce power around the clock and so the winds at this site they blow a lot in the evening hours we thought adding a solar facility to the project would provide more power during the day when combined with the battery projects you're going to have a closer to an around-the-clock solution which is ultimately how oregon is going to meet its renewables goals so we made the decision we expanded the project we went to our landowners and said within your 45 000 acres what would be a good spot for solar and there were a few different spots within the site that we looked at but this one was chosen for a number of reasons that we've outlined in this in this case here so the first one is probably the most compelling is that there's there's no irrigation here right this is um while it's classified as as prime farmland because of the viticulture overlay district that we're in we're close enough to the columbia river where someday somebody may grow without water you're not going to grow a lot of grapes here and so it's also not prime soils and you know they look at this land over the years it's been utilized as dry land wheat and you know when we came to them asking them what lands would you be willing to effectively give up farming this was at the top of the list and there were a couple other areas that were outlined in here but this one made the most sense because it was right in",

take a closer look thank you uh let's see Jeremy wants to know if we've considered an incentive tier for expand extended capacity heat pumps versus traditional Stephanie do you know um I was not entirely sure what you mean by extended capacity um but typically when we're looking at higher efficiency models we're looking at models that have either dual speed compressors or variable speed or you know kind of additional factors that would make them more efficient are often also increasing their capacity and their suitability to operate at multiple temperatures so oh and does not rely on backup heat once the outside time okay um so yes that's kind of another factor is we're looking at um trying to ensure that the installations that do get um installed as part of this program aren't going to wind up relying on electric resistance backup inside the heat pump and in turn increase those utility costs for residents so yes that's something that we are thinking about and um trying to make sure that uh as I said that you know this doesn't wind up costing our especially our low-income residents that we're trying to help through this program I'm trying not to cost them additional money down the road that they can't afford a question okay I think we've got time for the last two because I think they're quick ones I popped up the what's next slide um just a mid conversation here so folks know we are aiming to kick off our formal rulemaking program in a little over a month and we're aiming as I mentioned earlier for our programs to open in early 2023 you can see here James's email address and we would love to hear from you if you have further comments after this conversation um it's obvious we have experts on the line and we really do want to hear from you and then um are there heat pump incentive programs in place now in Oregon Rayland the answer is that there are through your utilities or if you're in PGE or Pacific Power or um anywhere that has an investor on utility territory then Idaho Power as well then you can go to the Energy Trust of Oregon and they do have a heat pump incentive program um and then there's also some for low-income oregonians through Oregon Housing and Community Services and then Camilo's question is does he have to wait for a local administrator to be established before he is a Portland homeowner will know where to apply for support and the answer to that question is yes so we're trying to get to that point as quick as we possibly can got you in mind um but the bill is written the way the bill is written so we have to follow that plan um and then once that will help connect people to those Regional administrators and once that happens and um Jim ended with that he has some concerns about manufactured home folks who rent the space navigating the application process and I encourage you to send your thoughts on to James um or I can stay on longer and hear from you if you want to raise your hand and we can take you off mute but otherwise if folks it's two o'clock like our time here is done so um if you have any anything else that you'd like to share I'll stick around for a couple of minutes here with anybody who wants to chat or um James's email address is there anymore we'd love to hear from you Braylon will take your off mute now Freeland hi I just was wondering what the rebate what is the typical uh how do they what's the income base that they work from uh for Energy Trust or the utilities I think they work with anybody um in their territory and Oregon Housing and Community Services does somebody know their it's Lo it's generally low income does anybody know their definition of low income um it differs for the the different programs uh I think for one of the programs it's 60 of the area of immediate income and yeah Drew just uh put in uh two and the other program is 200 of the federal poverty uh limit uh those are the the LIHEAP and the weatherization programs like if it's low uh regularly trade right okay okay yeah no problem I was gonna say and then moderate income is not super well defined but it would be something above those kind of low income true can somebody take two off me go um sorry yeah thanks for sticking around for extra questions appreciate it um yeah you started off the hour talking about how the heat Dome was kind of what prompted a lot of the legislation to go um and but this I'm just being extra um for my own sake uh this is not AC um only right that we're talking about okay all right fantastic and there was no there's no requirement on it didn't sound like you know you have to remove the old the old equipment um and it's not like a electric only type situation they're we're you could potentially install heat pumps in cast houses is what you're saying yep which is what I have so it's kind of nice I got to get asked questions about it by a legislator and got to be like I have this and it works great and it's really cold my furnace kicks on my gas furnace but I have a key is it a dual fuel heat pump that you have or is it you have a ductless I have an electric I don't have a ductless heat pump I have an electric heat pump like ground Source I think and then I have um a gas furnace okay that's like an older gas furnace that they just left in and you know twice or three times a year or something it pops on okay all right great I I uh I work at the Oregon training institute um and so we do a lot of work with the low income program uh the weatherization program so this uh sounds like it could be a cool opportunity to leverage more funding to get some more heat bumps into some people's houses maybe without even the the burden of the fuel switch so that sounds cool yeah I think so thanks Drew great thanks anybody else have any other questions for us all right well unless anyone else has anything we'll go but you can see that email address there for James feel free to follow up with him anytime um as we go through this process and we're really grateful um to those of you still on the line and also to my co-workers thank you so much for another public meeting all right I go stop sharing my screen bye Christy bye of course",

        "text": " that the new largest floating offshore wind farm is already under construction in norway right now and that will be an 88 megawatt wind next slide what i want to highlight with this chart is that today we're in the very early stages of floating offshore wind deployment globally there's about 123 megawatts of floating offshore wind turbines operating around the world right now but we expect this to grow to almost 8 gigawatts a little more than eight gigawatts by 2027 uh predominantly with floating wind farms in the uk south korea spain and japan um so what i want to emphasize is that the fixed bottom offshore wind industry is already well established there's about 50 and a half gigawatts of offshore wind turbines operating in the world that are on rigidly attached substructures those are foundations that are mounted directly into the seabed the the key thing there is that currently the maximum cost competitive water depth for those fixed bottom offshore wind turbines is around 60 advantage of floating is that it allows you to go further offshore or into new regions where there are deeper water so currently the the maximum water depth range that we believe is technically feasible for floating offshore wind farms is about 1300 meters water depth so we included those depth ranges in the cost study that we did last year for based on the water depths of the symmetry profiles in oregon almost all of offshore wind built in oregon waters will have to be floating just because the water depths are so so with that in mind just to recall that number there's about 123 megawatts of floating offshore wind uh but we expect exponential growth between now and 2027. the table on the right just shows you where the global distribution of newly added fixed bottom offshore wind capacity in 2021 came all right next slide we talk about floating offshore wind turbines and uh the substructures that we showed on the previous graph this is a another image just illustrating the three sort of main archetypes of floating offshore wind foundations or substructures um so the the key there are many different technology providers all competing to innovate right now as that exponential growth is is coming so um spar technology achieves stability with a really heavy ballast that goes deep below the water the challenge is that you need very deep water drafts in order to be able to deploy this technology so many ports aren't suitable because they don't have enough water depth to support that the semi-submersible substructure type is very stable uh when you're towing it out before it's anchored up and it achieves that stability with a lot of its mass concentrated near the water the challenge there is that you have more exposure to the waves with the tension leg platform it is has the the smallest footprint of the mooring system which the graphic on the right shows to some degree but it's also less stable as you're installing it and it's only once you've tensioned those vertical cables that you achieve that static stability with the the buoyancy so now i'll give you a quick overview of some of the cost modeling results that we generated last year so he this is from our our study um these are heat maps of offshore wind energy costs expressed in terms of levelized cost of energy which is a a representative per unit cost of energy over the lifetime of a wind plant operation some people point out that this level has cost of energy is really great when you want to just compare different technologies but it doesn't capture the the value of when you're contributing that energy i think that's one thing that jason mentioned before it's really important um and and i think others will speak more on that later i believe marty is speaking right so um but but this is level x cost of energy is valuable for being able to different technology types just on the cost basis so what we want to point out here is that there's strong north-south cost in organ waters and those are primarily driven by the distribution of wind resource or the speed distribution throughout oregon as well as the distance from shore which is reflected in terms of like the export cable and distance to the port for operations and maintenance processes so um the the two maps on the left show sort of costs of a hypothetical one gigawatt floating offshore wind farm if it were built you know in the present day more or less and then we're more concerned with the future costs because of the timeline for actually building a project so by 2032 we expect that the cost for floating wind will range from 50 megawatt hour to around 75 dollars a megawatt hour and the other thing to mention there i believe there was a question earlier about whether or not transmission costs were included so these numbers reflect cost to transmit the power to the shore and connect at a with a short spur line and on source onshore substations excuse me but they do not capture additional grid upgrade costs that would be needed just to illustrate sort of how that wind resource affects the cost this this map shows the the most up-to-date offshore wind resource assessment in the pacific and that has a 20-year data set so that was model data with the weather research and forecasting model wharf the key thing is that this is model data one key one critical next step is to that wind resource data set against measurements from for example a lidar measurement system lidar stands for light detection and ranging and that's a a tool that you can use to measure measure wind velocity so just to emphasize one more time that in the southern part of oregon you get average annual wind speeds as high as 11 and a half meters per second and those represent some of the best wind resource in the entire country what's driving offshore wind costs down the figure on the right is showing adjusted strike prices for existing fixed bottom offshore wind farms and what i want to highlight here is that since 2017 we've seen substantial cost reductions those have been driven mainly by technology economies of scale maturing supply chains you know industrialization of your production lines increased competition and the lower risk and i can expand on those in a second but what i want to emphasize here is with floating offshore wind we expect to see much of these similar cost reductions because the actual turbine technology isn't that different between floating offshore wind turbines and fixed bottom offshore wind turbines as i highlighted before the fixed bottom market is already well established globally and is only expected to grow further and so we believe that we're going to be able to leverage many of the learnings from the fixed bottom industry to help drive costs down for the floating industry um one of these factors that i mentioned i really want to emphasize that larger turbines and industrialization are two of the main factors in reducing future offshore wind costs especially floating next slide just this was a short talk we can definitely get more into the technical but i think what i want to take what i want to give as the key takeaways from uh are that you know floating offshore wind technology is currently in the early stages we only have 123 megawatts deployed but we expect almost exponential growth between now and the next five years i think that there are a number of different floating foundation substructure technologies that are and and that will help to drive innovation there's many companies all trying to get their their pilot projects and initial projects in as soon as they can so that they can attract the attention from investors as this industry grows so that that innovation is going to help with the cost reductions that we show from our our study last year that by 2032 we expect floating offshore wind costs in oregon to range from around 50 megawatt hour in the south 275 dollars a megawatt hour in the north that difference is primarily driven by the the exceptional resource in the southern part of oregon other factors that help contribute to that cost reduction and are essential for achieving those costs are maturing supply chains increasing turbine size industrial production and economies of just two other notes that you know to facilitate the development of this a marshalling port to help with the construction phase as well as the operation and maintenance phase of the wind farm is needed and there's potentially vast benefits to uh the economy of of oregon overall for offshore wind thank you hey patrick there's been some really good questions for you in the chat that's uh thanks for covering uh all of that i'm just gonna read them out for the folks on the phone too the first was from troy uh clarifying it was uh 50 500 megawatts or 17 99 megawatts and i think alan clarified it was 17k for 2021 only but to compare that with okay yes the 50 000 is the the total cumulative deployment so that's how much is currently operating and then that 17 000 number is that went into production last year and then there was another question about asking if you might be able to say more about the significant economic benefits that may be available and who they might be for sure i can only comment a little bit on that at this time but the i would say that the vast majority of the economic benefits happen during the construction and and they happen in and around the ports so so having an offshore wind port to support that construction phase is critical um but then there's also uh you know jobs and and may that come from the operations and maintenance phase of the the wind farm so the tax revenue from the sales of the electricity generated and the the you know maintenance of the turbines themselves are are part of that story too great thanks um the follow-up on that was whether you have data and what permanent jobs might be created by a offshore wind project of this scale sure how many so i i don't have that for oregon the the true expert for this topic would be jeremy stefik i can point to some of their work and some publications for other regions i know uh the gulf of mexico was one region they they did an analysis there and then i think recently published in the past couple weeks there was a an offshore wind supply chain study focused on the development of the east coast fixed bottom offshore wind industry and and the jobs created as that supply chain matures with the goal of trying to meet the the biden administration's 30 gigawatts of floating or sorry not floating total offshore wind in operation",

        "text": " last year. Yeah, but I'm still paying too much. I'm only living on $2,300 a month on Social Security. Remember that. Okay. Who else? How many people raise your hand that still want to speak? I see one hand. Okay. If you want to come up, ma'am, and be at this podium. Yes, sir. Hi. Okay, my name is Alan Santiago. I live at 6220 Southwest 89th street road, Ocala. 34476. And you're pulling that up right now, right? I'm going to pull it up because you're going to have a question. I do. I actually had a variety of questions before I got here, and you actually answered quite a few of them already. The first thing I would like to make a comment, and that's for us out here, is we seem to have gotten carried away with questioning you guys on things that really are controlled by the state. I get why they're asking those questions, but truly, there's nothing you guys can do regarding the state laws and federal laws, except for fight for us to try and help grab some of that money from the federal and from the state. So I can appreciate that. I'm new here. As you can see, my house closed December, the middle of December, and just a little bit. And I probably should have just drove down to your office in the day, but I saw the meeting here. So you can see on here, and I'm hoping, I'm reading it right, that I do have my homestead exemptions. But I'm not clear on what kind of actual discount that I get, because on the back page here, it says discounts a maximum of 4%. So if I'm looking at my tax bill and I see 4%, you know, we're talking just, like, a couple hundred dollars. Your exemption is $50,000. So what happens is, you have your taxable value, and then that $50,000 is deducted from your taxable value. So you don't pay taxes on that $50,000. Okay. Does that equate to a 4% difference? I'd have to read what it says on the back there, talking about if you. If you pay immediately versus waiting. Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's what that is. Oh, yeah. If you pay your taxes in November, you get a discount. When your tax bill comes out, if you pay it in November, you get a discount of 4%, but if you wait until March, then you pay the full amount. Oh, so that's not inclusive of that homestead. No, you get that additional to what you're seeing there. Okay, so this isn't my real tax bill then? No, this is a trim number. This is just. Okay. Okay. Okay. So you're gonna be actually voting on these numbers as it set? Yes, sir. Now, just on the millage rate, not on the values. The value is all done by the property appraiser's office. We don't have anything to do with that and we cannot change property values. If you have a problem with your value, you can go file to go in front of the value adjustment board. And I know every state that I've lived in, I lived in a variety of states, they've never appraised at what you bought the house for. It's always been lower. You know, I've lived in California appraised lower. Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Tennessee, and now here. And so whatever I've purchased my house for, I'll make up a number, 350. It's always appraised at maybe 205, 295, 290 or something like that. But. So they've never done it at true. At true market value. Market value. Thank you. And you definitely did not get. You did not get assessed at what you paid for, because I just looked that up, too. Yeah, no, I know what I paid for. And it's low. It's the price. Lower? Yeah. It's assessed lower. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that I am. Do you have any other questions? No, I just needed to clarify that. And again, I apologize for taking the time, but I also wanted you to know that I appreciate what you guys are trying to do. This isn't an easy job. You have a budget, you know, you got the expense. You mentioned the sheriff's department. Frankly, I think all those guys are heroes. They're trying to do a job like what they got to do. They're probably all grossly underpaid. You know, firemen are the same way. Thank you. So I used to be a union student. Maybe I can help you out. Oh, thanks. I'm sorry. That was a joke. Thank you. But anyway, that's it. What is your name and address? Mary Fernandez. And my address is ten. 330 Southwest 139th court in Dunelun, Florida. 34432. And the main reason that I'm here, it's because of the same of everybody. My husband and I. We moved from West Palm Beach, Texas, down Florida. They are crazy. Big city. Everything. We were trying to find a place where to raise our kids. We found Ocala. Super nice. We bought a house, this house, in December last year. It paid $1,600. Same thing of everybody. This year we are. It's proposed to be paid 3750. We understand gel medicine, but we live on a dirt road. We don't even have a paved road in front of our house. There is nothing in Ocala. Like. It's not a big city. I know it's a lot of people moving up here. I work in a public place and I can see how many people is moving up here. But the same thing. We live on a budget. That is the only reason that I'm. When did you buy your house? We bought it on December of last year. Last December? I already filed the tag. The well, your homestead probably hasn't kicked down. That's the issue. We filed already. Your problem is the same as everybody else's. Yes, ma'am. Next year you won't have this huge increase. But this year you're having it because of when you bought your home. I understand and I'm so thankful that you guys are here to listen and we can come in and explain everything to you. Thank you so much. Thank you for coming. Anyone else that wants to address the commission? Okay, then. I'll turn it back over to Audrey. Alright. So the taxing authority for consideration is a general fund.

        "text": "It. It. It. It. It. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County, Florida County Commissioner's public hearing. This meeting is being called to order on December 13, just after 02:00 p.m. our first public hearing is to consider an ordinance to establish the Marion Ranch Community Development District. And if you would all please rise with me for the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, everyone. And now we'll just ask for roll call and proof of public hearing. Chairman Stone. Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Here. Commissioner Curry. Here. Commissioner McLean. Here. Commissioner Zalick. Here. Thank you. If you'll move forward with the public, the first one. Yes, ma'am. I have a proof publication of a display ad entitled Notice of Public Hearing published in the Star banner November 17, November 24, December 1 and December 8, 2023. Thank you very much. And next we've got Mister Rison. Haven't seen you in a while. Welcome back. Do apologize for missing last week. Well, we missed you. Welcome back. And I'll turn the floor to you to introduce and provide the documentation necessary for this public hearing. Thank you. This request is for a proposal for the Marion Ranch Community Development District, or CDD as they referenced. It's under the Freedom Commons Development. This is provided for by a local firm out of the Tampa area. The location for this overall CD CDD is located off of the southwest 49th Avenue corridor at the intersection of Southwest 80th street. This project may seem familiar. It was initially approved as a pud, which is referenced as the originally Freedom Commons pud. The overall acreage for the proposal is approximately just a little bit more than 324 acres, and that original Pud rezoning was granted in 2001 in August, and the overall PD has an approval for approximately 1380, 312 units. Just to give you some familiarity, the request is for a community development district, which are provided for in Florida statutes related to chapter 190, which is the Uniform Community Development District act of 1980, and then also under chapter 189, which is the uniform Special District Accountability act. As community development districts are considered special districts, so they have both those operating statutes that they function under. Essentially they are created by a local government when they are less than 2500 acres, but then the state of Florida would actually create them if they are larger than 2500 acres. They are an independent operational entity over at the geographic area that they would serve. They do function as a limited form of a local government, but they do not have police powers. They are granted some independent powers, however more extensive than the local government, but with, as I noted, fewer powers in the city or county. They are eligible for design and construction of improvements and other services support of their geographic area. They can also function in addition to an association for ownership, and then they can provide some enforcement of ownership provisions with suitable agreements. They are governed by a board of supervisors. Initially, that board of supervisors will oversee the implementation and operation of the district. There is an initial board that is established with the creation of the district. However, members do serve staggered terms. Then over the course of time, the appointed members roll out and then elected members roll in that are elected from the members of the district by the voters. An example of you may have seen for the villages of Marion CDD when they have their elections for their new board of supervisors. It appears on the ballot because it is coordinated through the board of the Marion county election supervisor as the original and then the employee does employ a district manager for overseeing data operations. The overall CDD that we have here relates back to that PDD. Again, they're at this point having a phase one, two, three and four is this geographic area, five is this southern portion and then six is this upper portion. Overall what they are proposing under the CDD to address different improvements for their site, which is their general earthwork, their utilities, their stormwater, general public roadways and public landscaping. Overall, the construction will all be done by the district. Other things then with ownership and maintenance will then convert to the county or maybe split depending on how that approval processes work through Marion County's systems. Currently, they currently have projected out the estimated cost for overall for the improvements for the different sections and activities. They are currently looking at a final completion date in approximately 2028 for the overall project. Generally, staff does recommend approval of their request and at this point we'll look for questions and the applicants are here for questions as well. Thank you. Do we have any questions for staff? Sure. Just for public record. Chris, can you tell us what is the benefit to the developer to establish the CDD over just going about business as normal under the CDD provisions? They do a bonding system which apparently do have lower interest rates which then has a lower cost overall for their development costs because they're not doing conventional mortgage style construction financing. And is there any negative impact to the county for the county generally? No, it is not. It is a physical geographic area that is responsible for the repayment of those bonds. The county is available to step in most communities. Should that occur, they end up utilizing the MSBU programs that they have available. Thank you. Good questions. Yes, sir. Mister Minter, if I, if I could follow up on that. So Mister Risen, if you don't have a CDD, if the developer puts in all the infrastructure himself, then that infrastructure would be cost would be reflected in the home purchase price, correct? Correct? Yes, sir. Okay, so if you have a CDD and the developer didn't pay the infrastructure cost because it was funded by the bond issue, then theoretically, the cost of that infrastructure is not reflected in the home purchase price. Potentially that's where that is a private matter that comes from that CDD operations, because they've theoretically financed it at a lower cost and it's not being directly funded, they have the ability to provincially provide for a lower price on their housing. So if you're a home buyer in a CDD district and you're buying a $300,000 home, there was a given the competitive market, if there was a similar home in a non CDD district for the same price you paid that 300,000 in the non CD district, you wouldn't be paying assessments for years after that to pay off the bonds, correct? Not in terms of a CDD, although you may be paying property owners assessments if they are private roads, for instance. Thank you. Any other questions of staff? No. And just again, for the public record, they do pay the same property taxes as everyone else pays. There's no difference in what someone who lives in a CDD pays to the community or not to the community, to the county, for MSVU, for law enforcement, or all of the other normal taxes that someone else pays. Correct. Thank you. Just for reference, we do send this information to the Marion County Property Appraiser's office, so they can check to be ready for if this is approved. They arrange to set up the geographic reflection and coordinate with then the ultimate board of supervisors that's created in that manager to arrange for that. Because these CDD's do assess through the tax collections becoming an additional entry onto the tax bills. And then they're also, as they move forward, they're responsible for their roadways and the other things that are within that CDD. The only thing that's not going to be within this CDD that they would be responsible for is the water, sewer water, because that's going to be turned over to the county because they're hooking up to Marion county utilities. Correct. And then I believe there's a county roadway that will run one county roadway that will run through there, one that will be open for the public use. Yes, ma'am. Okay. But it's also planted as a private right. I understand. One question to follow up on. Water and sewer. That system will be constructed as part of the project. Correct. Then they will be. It will be turned over to the county with no restriction related to the bond or anything else they use to build it? That is my understanding. Correct. What occurs is they will have to do the same releases of liens, complete ownership and conveyance as any other project would do. That has actually occurred in the Ocala preserve CDD, which is one of our more recent ones. That was done. And it has to be built to county standards. Yes. Okay. And the applicant may clarify that, too. Did you have something, Commissioner Zalick? No. Okay. I'll ask the applicant to come up and if they'd like to come forward and maybe clarify anything that you believe would be important to go on the record before we open it to public comment. Yes, it is. Thank you. Commissioners Greg Urbanzik with Coleman. Yovanovitch and Kest. Yovanovitch and Caster. I'm here on behalf of. After the applicant. I also have our development team here. Could you also give your address before you move forward? Sure. Thank you. Sure. My office address is 4001 Tamiami trail. It's in Naples, Florida. Thank you. To answer the question that was asked about utilities, yes. The intent, a part of our project that the CDD will do will be water and sewer. Those will be",

        "text": " scenario we would consider the options available to us but we are mindful that having an outcome where you have 20 people is not one that we want to see and it's not one that we've seen so far will there be some kind of indication or message when or if the program sells out yes absolutely we um give you a question i think a channel about um our ability to communicate the budget participation to contractors and um it's our our clear goal to be able to be proactive about uh communicating the status of our available rebate ideally we would be able to have a dashboarding system on our on our web page that we upload we update at the end of at the end of the night i can't i can't commit to that level of technical um sophistication but we will have some dashboarding we will we will actively communicate where we are in the process and we will certainly let you know in advance of running out when we're getting close john i guess what i meant was um dur on the 27th no when or if the program sells out with people who are feverishly trying to enter applications in is there something that's going to say hey listen don't bother to do the work it's sold out yeah right um yes so we have a internal process for evaluating the budget so so we're periodically examining our where where our um the projects that we have allocated and how much money have been allocated to the budget so how much budget we have available we do that periodically throughout the day so we so we avoid a scenario where we over allocate funding that's something that that's never happened and it will never so yes so throughout the day if we have a scenario where due to the volume of our requests we uh run out of money you know and again i don't think that's gonna happen on day one i would hope not we will notify folks but but in terms of are we gonna are we gonna be able to do it through power um i would think that our first point of notification would be like an email blast out to our contractor distribution list to know and then detailing out what actions we're going to take like we we wouldn't just unilaterally turn your ability off to make it to make a reservation i think that would be a little bit awkward it would give you some noticing walk through the process and now that may soon be followed by turning off the ability to make a rebate but there would be a communication chain to that let's see okay can we resubmit previously declined applications yes yes you can i again i i'm pretty i'm presuming that these were declined because of lack of funds we didn't decline some because they were uh projects that were contracted prior to january one of of uh 2020. can you okay uh the eto allows for including partial tsrf that qualifies meaning some panels qualifying some do not as long as microinverters or optimizers are used and only the part that qualifies gets the rebate i thought it sounded like partial will not be allowed for your program all or nothing so a strict reading of sort of strict reading of the rules is um that the tsrep is calculated for each for each pv array and a and b options right for on-site shade analysis it must be 75 or greater all points on the pv array that's the that's the requirement in terms of how the agency chooses to interpret that i know in the past we have allowed uh specific panels to be um so there's been a pro rata of the of the and uh that's with and so acting consistent with that on a going forward basis is how we would handle that does that make sense so similar to so it sounds like that's similar to how eto handles it so we in practice the way that we enforce and interpret this rule is similar to the way the eto does it that was a long answer for a simple answer uh will there is it possible to allow all users to see all projects or just some users to see some project is that the answer use the grant access button under settings there was a question earlier yeah so there you go i actually get you to ask the question upstream is to use the grant access button in your power floor settings we just had this come up each user needs to grant access to other users to see their applications under grant access okay we're all we figured we figured it out all right uh so with tsrf we can't have partial incentives on qualifying panels with individual power regulators so the um though so again just to reiterate this um our pattern and practice and the way we've interpreted our rule is to allow partials consistent with the way the etl does it how long after completion will the contractor receive payment great question uh when we have an faq about this subject on our webpage under contractor resources called about rebate payments and let me just take a little bit i'll take a second to talk about it because i think this is going to be helpful for folks it typically takes about two weeks for the department of administrative services to issue a payment so for those that maybe don't that don't know um when we as an agency get rebate requests we go we go through our process of approving it and then we have to make your request to another state agency known as the department of administrative services and they actually process out payments to vendors of the state and that process typically takes two weeks and it requires an active w-9 uh on file and so if folks as contractors have been paid by the state your payment you're not going to need to provide a w-9 and your payment may come slightly faster in that spectrum of two weeks the department of administrative services doesn't have to go through the process of sort of setting you up as a um you do have the option of signing up for an electronic funds transfer so in lieu of getting a paper which is the two week no um timeline that i'm giving is is a pay-per-check basis um you can sign up for electronic funds transfer you can have an ach directly deposited into your account that will cut time off so you could get your payment within a week for example if you use efts and we have a link to the accounting system with the state where you can actually as a vendor sign up for direct deposit and that's located in our about rebates page on our program website i encourage folks to sign up because you get your check faster and it's cheaper for the state so it's a win-win do battery only projects count towards the 20 project limit so battery only projects are um this is a common the only project types that are eligible pv systems or pv systems with paired solar so a standalone battery project for example is not is not eligible for a rebate under the under statute uh let's see questions from q a if a customer intends to install both pv and batteries but has less than the required for the uh the pub array can they still get the battery system incentive so we have a um to find oh is it let me let me just make sure i have this number correctly there's a certain amount of panel that you have to have in order to get your i think that's the question it's either three or five huh yeah it's five when we're talking about a paired solar and storage problem uh a paired solar storage system the system has to have one um has to have one kilowatt dc of installed uh solar electric nameplate for every five kilowatts of battery storage uh and so then with regards to the question if it has less it has less than the required tsrf for the pv array can they still get the battery system so they would have to have at least one kilowatt of of tsrf eligible panel in their array to be eligible for the for the battery system incentive so there's a one one to five ratio so if you had a five kilowatt battery you would have to have at least a one um kilowatt system that was eligible for our for us for our um sorry that that took a while for me to to really gronk that question regarding the location of tsrf is the measurement supposed to come from the shadiest location of the array or is an average tsrf acceptable for example if one module gets less than the required solar access but the others in the array qualify and the average qualifies does such an array qualify for the pb rebate so if you so there's an average of the array but also when you're loading in power clerk there's an evaluation on a module basis and so typically we don't run into so typically we actually know the tsrf on a sort of a module by module basis so i'm not sure the shadiest location i mean again this is yourself and i guess i need a little help with the context of this question maybe i think the question was answered already sorry i sent that earlier but um basically it sounds like you'll award a um you know array yeah yeah thanks thank you if the customer has an existing pv array wants to add batteries and get the battery rebate do we enter yeah so again the only eligible systems uh are paired solar that includes storage are are paired solar storage systems and under statute that means that it has to be installed together so we can't add batteries to an existing array you said yes to previously denied applications but that may not be true if those projects were already built yes that's a good yeah so tamara that's a really really good point um previously declined applications obviously welcome to resubmit just understand uh under statute that you can't apply for a rebate if you have already started construction as far as the battery being paired with the solar we have a number of contracts that were signed within the last nine months where they signed up for pv and storage we installed the storage but are waiting on the battery so they're paired on the same contract but the pbs are can they qualify for the in storage so so yeah so um for our purposes and this is particularly true it's my understanding right there's a pretty long lead time on a lot of batteries right now um we're not going to come out and ch and like check that you're putting them in like at you know on on tuesday for example so the expectation really is at from the point in which you've made your request for reservation and you've started installation to when you apply for your rebate um as long as the pv and the storage are installed at the time of the rebate request our our um assumption",

        "text": " doing those upgrades in new affordable housing um that to me just seems like you know loow hanging fruit so um I'm just really mystified by you know the scores who judged and who who what the criteria was for the scores you know who scored it and everything else um in some ways it feels like more of a priority for spending than it does a priority for reducing greenhouse gases wow so great questions mayor K I really appreciate this so those screening criteria that are reflected in that file mem I'm happy to follow up with more information about those those were developed by our Consulting team um and shared out with this climate Partners Forum over the course of two successive meetings they were designed to reflect the um criteria that EPA is putting in it's uh in the implementation Grant applications we wanted to align with the implementation Grant criteria so that we could be telegraphing which projects were likely to be competitive when EPA opened up these implementation grants and you know it's definitely more art than science in some cases because the evalu the implementation Grant notice of funding opportunity and the evaluation criteria are not 100% clear they didn't tell us exactly how to quantify this stuff we had to make our best guesses with respect to what EPA was looking for but one of the reasons why I think you know and I don't have the members of the Consulting team on to support me and get into all the details of that today but one of the things I do know is that cost effectiveness of greenhouse gas reductions is a Criterion for EPA and that's that may be one reason why parking pricing shows up competitively because generally uh you know parking pricing and involves some small startup costs but you can recoup those costs so you know it may not be it may be that it was scoring higher and I think there only difference of a point or two there um not necessarily because it reduced more greenhouse gas gases but because it did so at a significantly lower cost um and as far as new housing that's actually a really great uh question new housing is currently not required to be as energy efficient as it could be and the reason that I've heard for that is because we have expensive land in our region and we have a housing crisis and it's it's really important to get more units out there to meet our to make sure that housing's affordable especially affordable units and there's a re there's a concern that if we place unfunded requirements on new affordable housing to also really get to the best Energy Efficiency standards um then it would ultimately result in less units being built and less being done to address the housing crisis in the region and so getting funding from EPA so that we don't have to put those costs of making a new development on developers allows us to get around those tradeoff and ensure that new units are more Energy Efficiency efficient without creating a risk that LE fewer of those units will be produced thank you that I appreciate the explanations the answers that was really helpful other questions I think we've got Council Rosenthal with his hand Rosen thank you thank you chair bunick U just two question first of all on that first list of the stakeholders or I should say the committee maybe I missed it but uh I would think wash dot would be somewhat involved since transportation is one of the big things I don't remember seeing it um maybe I missed it and then my other question is a little larger u in your second list that you presented of potential projects you talked about expanding the opportunities for producing green energy but my understanding is that we have some power grid uh limitations on doing that extensively and I remember recently a visit to the PGE headquarters and one of the things that could be done would be expand their you know storage battery capacity so we can utilize more clean energy sources is that something that's being considered or is that something that um you know could be applied as a grant I'm just wondering where that stands do we need power grid uh power modifications okay great thank you for these great questions so first of all um wash do is definitely on the list of partners that we invite to the Forum um and in addition they uh they they sent staff to one of the Forum meetings but also I coordinate with my grant my grant counterparts at wash do and DEQ behind the scenes regularly as well to make sure we're not do stepping on each other's toes and that actually kind of gets to why energy generation wasn't included in the shortterm strategy were create where they were just about to wrap up and you know the type of feedback back that actually we're really looking for to see if and how we would we would address this over the long term because this first plan was really focused on things that it makes sense for our region to implement in five years and I think some of the uncertainty that you're describing Council Rosenthal not in terms not just in terms like the grids capacity but also the state just changed its regulations to require utilities to bring a lot more clean energy into their supply between now and 2035 and so I think there were a lot of questions that we grappled with as where it seems like there is something our region should could be doing to increase renewable energy generation and it felt like we need a little bit more thinking to think about exactly what that will be because if the state is going to require utilities to get cleaner and if the grid if utilities are still talking back and forth with the state about whether or not we have the capacity to do that we kind of need to see how that conversation plays out a little bit to know where we can best make a difference as as locals um and so you know that's that's really great feedback because I you know that's you're giving me something to kind of watch out for that helps us figure out how to move forward with this this area in the next round of planning well I just a comment I I had from PG was when it CES to you know long-term battery storage for alternative energy sources that they they were not the technology leader they would apply and adapt and Implement things as the situation improved or as you know incentives improved so that that seems like a direction we're going to be going at some point but I understand the state has to be involved other questions not see else's hands up so uh thank you very much OT for coming today and letting us know what's going on with this grant process and looking forward to working with you uh on implementing this eventually throughout the Washington County area and individual cities thanks for everyone's time today all right that brings us to uh 4B which is the transportation development tax rate update uh this will be led by diami is here there he is uh the tdt ordinance requires an annual rate adjustment uh this is a non-discretionary action but still must be approved by the Washington County Board of Commissioners uh this year the tdt rate will increase by is it up by or percent so diami you're on so uh sorry chair if I could really quickly just a couple couple of little administrative things I wanted to note commissioner fi and mayor winsell had joined during the last agenda item so make sure you knew they were there as well as um we're running a little bit ahead of schedule actually today and so we may need to juggle the order just a little bit so after the tdt item I may suggest that we jump to the jpa agenda and impact agenda next okay okay thank you welcome all right thanks chair uh yes uh so per the tdt ordinance Washington County staff and the board of County Commissioners are required to uh take action on the tdt rate adjustment uh on an annual basis um as you described and that uh rate does go into effect July 1 and to answer your question in terms of um the rate adjustment it is 8.29% is the increase uh over the prior Year and that rate adjustment is based on a five-year rolling uh indexed average weighted uh based on construction costs labor and rideway costs and um so we have calculated that the rate table is in your packet uh and um so happy to answer any questions this is non again just non-discretionary so it's more informational uh for wccc members and our board will act on it um in May in advance of the rate going into effect in July questions for dami pretty quiet um chair I might just make a note this is a recurring item that happens every year and as Yi pointed out it's really non-discretionary in the tdt code code but it does require uh a board a board action and so one of the challenges that we consistently have had with tdt is that the index really isn't truly keeping up with cost increases and so it's always a bit of a lagging indicator but uh we are pleased to see that there's a fairly significant increase this year I mean and again tradeoffs um adding adding to the cost of housing and other development but this is also important to help us try to at least do our best to keep pace with uh cost increases for transportation yep any questions all right well see oh mayor Callaway's hand is up oh thank you thank you Stephen thank you chair so I guess um you know you know I guess part of you know cities are getting hammered you know by the state by the Home Builders that you know we're the ones that aren't that are you know infringing or or throwing up obstacles and roadblocks to to building houses and so you know as this goes forward I just hope that legislators that this is communicated to legislators as to why because otherwise cities you know I don't know maybe it's maybe I'm on the way ambulance this morning but it just sort of feels like cities sometimes become um the the The Messengers of this and um and and we're going to be doing the same things as cities we have to adjust it also but um you know if if we can all speak kind of with you know One Voice or at least one perspective you know I think that's that consistency um and you know will will help um with the delivering of the aged anything else on this subject all right thanks dami uh so as uh Stephen recommended we'll go ahead and jump over to 4E uh the jpack agenda and that'll be Liv by Mary Callaway commissioner F would you you know do you want to jump in on that one otherwise let me uh let me find that may mayor call",

        "text": " contested case order that they would like to see corrected um i have uh the the sheets from both of those um they should have been forwarded on uh to you all um and after we get through the remainder of the substantive issues here i'll be bringing that up again to talk about but again the idea with those is they truly are non-substantive um purely typo type errors um um the council's role here in reviewing the proposed contested case order is to determine whether or not it agrees with the outcome and findings that the hearing officer reached um and uh or whether or not there are any modifications that ought to be made and then there's also a technical task involved here in terms of integrating the proposed issued by department staff and the hearing officer's order ensure that they're both properly reflected and so if we get to that stage on this where there's a clear understanding where the council wants to go on each of the contest case hearing i do have a draft final order prepared for you all to review that would accomplish that that would take the proposed contested case order and incorporate that into a version of the department's proposed which could ultimately become the council's final order those are all the preliminaries here and i'll stop before going on to the next slide to see if there are any questions at this point madam chair this is hanley go ahead henley jesse um i have a few i think additional scrivener errors um do you want those when we get to the end thank you okay so i'm going to go ahead and ask that we move on to the next slide thank you sarah and we'll dive into the issues here the majority of the issues that were and dealt with in the contested case hearing are land use issues this first issue is one of those whether the application impermissibly includes development with the fort rock planning area that is more than 600 feet from existing roads in violation of part of the lake counties or zoning ordinance and policies of the lake county comprehensive plan and so the hearing officer noted first on this issue that uh the primary facts here are not in dispute there is a part of the site that is within the fort rock planting area much of uh facilitated facility structures um would be located more than 600 feet from existing roads um and so then the remaining question is given those facts um you know is there actually a violation um that of the um the comprehensive plan that is in this process what the hearing officer concluded was the application nonetheless complies with the applicable substantive criteria and again that is what the council is charged with reviewing in terms of determining um compliance with the land use standard the council's land use standard um is the applicable substantive criteria so the hearing officer determined that it would comply with the applicable substantive criteria because the policies that were which talk about the the distance from existing roads in the fort rock planning area those policies are not applicable substantive criteria um for two reasons uh first the policies are not reflected in any provision of the zoning ordinance that would implement the policies um and then second the policies are not required by the uh overarching statewide planning goal number two and uh in addition to um just the kind of hearing officer's technical reading of this there was also some um testimony um or you know documents submitted by um the planning board that reflected the um the county's position that um uh those policies were not applicable substantive criteria um in this particular context so that is a summary of issue number one um i will as we're going through here note the page numbers of the proposed contested case order where the issue was taken up in this case it's pages 85 through 87 if the council has any questions about how the hearing officer handled this one you know we can have a discussion you know based on on those page numbers where it was and uh in general you know as i will do for each one of these issues i've had a chance to the uh the hearing officer's disposition of the issue um and conclude in this case um uh that um i believe that the hearing officer's decision is well supported um that uh um both the evidence and the law um support the outcome that he reached procedurally you know process-wise here what i'm going to do is just stop after each one of these um see if there are any questions the council can decide whether or not we want to pause to take a straw poll on each one of these as we go through them or whether you'd prefer me to just run through the list before we we do that but i do want to make sure the minimum that i'm stopping to allow people to ask questions because uh you know things can can get lost as i continue on here so um i will do that now this is handling yes hanley so uh jesse initial inclination was that you know this is a land use plan policy um that um there's a limitation here but this the county did not and they interpreted their their comprehensive plan and their zoning ordinance to not have limitation implemented and so i put a lot of weight on mr johnson's of his land use regulations that you know this limitation is not uh implemented through their comprehensive land use plan um and and that uh you know there's no and that if you took this literally there would be no development that occur that could occur beyond the 600 feet including agricultural structures i am in concurrence with the interpretation on the part of the department on this thank you hanley other comments i think the question is what jesse asked do you want to do a straw poll after issue or do you want to do them all at the end i just assume do it as we go through each issue while it's this is hanley thank you hanley any objection to that no objection hearing none so uh then i guess we will do it uh as we go along sure uh thank you madam chair so um since this is informal um we're not taking any binding decisions here um i will just go ahead and and ask the council myself with your permission madam chair um and the way i'm gonna phrase things is just simply whether or not um the council has any disagreement with the hearing officer's conclusions on this issue just to kind of keep it very simple so that's what i'll do for each one of these so i'm starting with one here whether or not any of the council have a disagreement with the conclusion that the hearing officer this particular part of um the comprehensive plan the policies 10 and 11 are not applicable substantive um and therefore the applicant did not fail to show or fail to meet um the uh the council's land use planning standard with respect to this issue do you want us to do a thumbs up or respond individually at this point i'll just uh ask whether or not there are any objections um okay and uh if anyone has them um we'll just take a few seconds and uh and see and if there aren't then i can just go ahead and move on and i concur with you handling it and the way that you've decided or you've thank you no objection hearing none so we'll move on to uh if okay so uh issue two and this is gonna be the the first in a series of issues that deal with farm impacts um that again are land use related here so this is whether the application failed to demonstrate compliance with conditional use requirements for non-farm use in the a2 zone as required by part of the county's orbiting ordinance because potential impacts including fugitive dust invasive weeds competition for water resources wildlife displacement increased thermal energy would result in a failure to demonstrate that the proposed facility is compatible with foreign pieces with the intent and purposes of ors 215 that does not seriously interfere with accepted farm news but farming practices on adjacent lands and that it does not materially alter the stability of the overall land use pattern of the area um so that issue statement's quite a mouthful but the you know the summary of that is that the um protestants here had raised a number of concerns about potential farm use impacts and uh asserted that these impacts um uh meant that the applicant had not proved that um the proposed facility is um uh meets the the statute the standards of the and so if we could go ahead and go on then to the next slide which talks about the hearing officer's determination the hearing officer concluded that the site certificate application as conditioned in the proposed order complies with conditional user permit the parties failed to establish and the limited parties the protestants here failed to establish that the proposed facilities conditioned would seriously interfere with accepted farming practices or materially alter the stability of the overall land use patterns of the area and i'll dive into that just a little bit more in terms of um if you're an officer's um reasoning and you know it's essentially the hearing officer concluded that the protestants hadn't provided evidence that the impacts that they alleged were likely to occur and the hearing officer concluded that the protestants didn't take into account required mitigation measures that were adopted in the proposed order or assumed that those those mitigation measures would fail you know um it is possible of course to demonstrate that um a proposed mitigation measure might fail but there needs to be evidence that backs up that assertion um and uh the hearing officer concluded that the the protestants just had not submitted sufficient information there with respect to the the notion of materially altering the overall land use pattern of the area um the hearing officer concluded that um the uh site certificate application was um consistent uh with the land you stand it here the anchorage on which the facility would be placed um as non-arable and does not have water rights um more specifically um would in order to make it a better quality farmland would require water um and that um the ability to obtain a water right um would need to come through transfer that the ability to obtain that is speculative and then finally that the project area um here comprises a small fraction of the total land within lake county that's within pharmus so once again as with all these i've taken a look at the hearing officer's reasoning and and believe that they are supported by the facts in the law so i'll stop and ask if there are any questions um and uh if there aren't then we can move on to the straw poll on this one so jesse the overall land use pattern of the area is part of this issue also isn't it yes that's correct yes and",

Please Hello everyone, thank you, I am a planning administrator. I appreciate, yes, there are too many cases combined into one. This is a four hundred and twenty-six multifamily units. It is requested to subdivide the property into six lots. in some lots others that remain vacant in a mixed-use zone for future developments there are several requests such as permits adjustments for the design standards for a multifamily and a variation of The regulation of trees the decision proposed by the staff is 63 points that require standards based on the lines to the streets and some aspects that need a redesign to be able to save some trees in the construction of the parking lots. We are trying to balance preserving as many trees as we can in this multifamily construction, the proportion of the streets the best on the street drinking water lines sewage lines rainwater collection lines we have standards for intersections in these departments in the public hearing you heard all the testimonies And we have the written record open he we have sent them this in memos we have seven days for testimonies for anyone who still wants to give their testimony and another seven days in case of any refutation of these. Then we have the deliberations without And in this period it will no longer be possible to receive testimonies. Thank you for this summary, it helps us to remember us in where we are, we are here to deliberate and make a decision today the floor is open to any comments on the matter counselor Barney thank you very much Yes well I appreciate the comments the ideas the memos all the pages that sent us the code materials that We have received in recent months I want to say if you are on as a counselor we have the task of reaching a decision we must balance the housing policies climate resilience and the liveability of the city for the future I have problems and concerns about this plan for several reasons In short, based on the documents that were given to me to evaluate this request, the applicant is doing his due diligence, considering all the alternatives to conserve the trees, taking advantage of rainwater and accessibility, I believe that he has not met his burden of proof, it simply shows some alternatives therefore the applicant's burden of proof has not been met when this territory was acquired it was known that there were challenges due to the topography they also knew that there were several historic trees with special requirements for their conservation there will be greater traffic congestion and There are several sensitive wetland areas on the property. Simply because you were allowed to build five hundred and twenty units on the two plan does not mean that the topography will allow such an extent of development based on the compilation of hundreds of pages that I have reviewed I am concerned that what I see there are gaps in the one that has given us the 63 conditions that had to be attached for this project to be tested and the process follows the gaps. I want to thank the city staff for being able to place this square screw in a round hole and this allows us It has led to where we are today on a positive note yes we need housing I understand it I am not against development But it has to be an intelligent development incorporating the tools that we have acquired over the years We have to be aware of the characteristics of the communities and their impacts on the community as well as the national environment we need additional housing and we need to have it so that people have roofs they must also be affordable and they are going to have commercial value and I don't know if the Residents who earn just the lowest average income will be able to afford a three- bedroom apartment in this development and this brings us to my concern about trees. We have heard many testimonies from the Wesalen Neighborhood Association of the Water Council about the importance they have. These trees, trees are living beings that I appreciate, we know how important they are for the environment. We also know that it is difficult to find a parking space under the shade of a tree on an afternoon like today, we have a vegetation cover and it is burning more and more. Because of the heat and low humidity I believe we should conserve the trees as we can moving forward I believe this plan includes conserving more trees another concern is storm water the Salem code requires that there be as little alteration to the national environment as possible this destroys the beauty and ecological functions of that place this development is adjacent to properties that use wells for water supply how will it be with the removal of groundwater when the vegetation and trees are removed and this effect on the topography and soils will impact To the people who depend on Los Pozos it is the source of streams and rivers in low elevation places and due to the rate of percolation due to the slope of the soil, there are required facilities to take advantage of rainwater and not deplete groundwater sources. I have not seen any document that mentions this in chapters seventy-one in the storm water code under objectives of that chapter point B protect to the greatest practical extent in water aquatic life protect it from pollution erosion flooding or any potential damage whether due to natural causes or caused by human activity dot implement specific practices to the seven including green infrastructure for stormwater as much as practical and in section seventy- one dot zero seven five the requirements for all projects anyone who A project should be carried out to conserve existing trees to the maximum extent possible to avoid volumes of stormwater runoff point e when there is vegetation in pre-development conserve vegetation to the maximum extent possible and provide landscaping by planting new trees as much as possible in order to to post-development stormwater runoff and finally, if the site discharges to a wetland, wetland as the inventory or outlined by the development of the city, the hydrological conditions and characteristics of the wetlands will be protected to avoid adverse impacts to them, so I am concerned a lot of this stormwater issue and how it has been addressed so far under section seventy-one point zero nine five under design says green stormwater infrastructure will be installed as much as feasible can we use stormwater planters or gardens to store this water so all this indicates alternatives here but I have not seen any plans that incorporate these alternatives the other thing that worries me is Ada the law of Americans with disabilities and their accesses I have seen a lot of testimonies emails and it worries me and it was not discussed in the planning material at all and when I saw the plans, maps and so on, I verified the number and location of the handicap parking spaces. I don't know how much the requirement is, but I see very few of them and I assumed they were going to be right where the entrance to the parking lot is. the buildings but not many are at the end of the parking lot or on the other side So I don't understand What is the justification for putting them there it also occupies the road on its slope without a viable activity for people who use wheelchairs to move here with This twelve percent slope, I can't imagine going up the slope to go to landergar, not returning, for example, returning to high school, if the person in a wheelchair is a student, I also mentioned access easement for lot six, which is developed and really There are many challenges for people who have mobility disabilities so I think it is important that we focus on this. The city has jurisdiction over pedestrian routes as an area such as models and parking areas. Each development has its own challenges. I realize this is a topographical trust. from usl But this is not adequate to meet the needs of the residents the council must approve plans that meet the needs of the residents any entrance or sidewalk must accommodate people with all needs meeting their requirements so that everyone benefits both now and in the future thank you Thank you very much counselor I need a pause and give the floor to counselor Gonz\u00e1lez Yes sorry I was absent because I was not at the public hearing Yes yes Okay thank you any other comments from beyond Apple yes counselor Barney my reaction to What we should say I agree with many of the things you said the problem I have is that I don't know if many of these things give us the authority to vote that is something that comes with the use of the land this It is frustrating about the law because we as officials must take the facts, apply the rules and reach a decision and we are making political calculations here instead of making these decisions. So the public gets frustrated because they think we could do it but in reality the law does not allow us to do it. gives options you have seen on several occasions when the majority of the Council has done this and by law we are not valid in everything that I have read about this case I can agree with many things but I believe that those are not grounds to deny I listen to you and I appreciate your ideas but I don't see that these are justifications to deny this development councilor is sorry yes thank you Yes well as another councilor who represents that this is actually a battle mayor today I understand where to review all this information and find any justification to vote no and I can't make a political vote right in me that's not how I function so I have a hard time with this point I agree with everything you said the trees I know it breaks our hearts you and I also connected the stormwater thing. I grew up in Wesley and with all the developments my parents' well started to dry up they had to drill more it's a real problem And I really appreciate your advocacy work for Ada issues with this development I saw the Super blocks where they",

        "text": "we have one more big topic of the day and it's a legislative update and we're really glad to be joined by our rock government relations team hopefully your ears were burning nice and warmly earlier today as we were talking about you two so thank you very much Ms Doyle and Dr Khan for joining us and we'll turn it over to you thank you and good afternoon not good morning like my notes say um thank you for being willing to come back at four o'clock there's just a lot going on in the legislative section that uh took us away after that original time period ran over um and I'll have if click most could pull up our supplies or or someone one second Aaron yeah and they know that he had them because he told me he moved through them for me so you don't hear the infamous here we go um so we only have 30-minute schedules with you today uh so we'll kind of rip through a lot of this as quickly as possible again Erin Doyle for the record uh your senior government really manager um thank you very much for the time today so just really quickly we're going to do a quick reminder of what this session is about how you can stick to the agenda page and then we have a few slides on some of the hot topics and priority if you understand it probably not all you would like to talk to us about so we're prepared to have conversations about um any other legislative issues that might come to mind but one that does come to mind for me faith in your conversations today is around what's happening at the state level on um that if not in the slide presentation but happy to have that conversation if you are prepared for it and we have time and then just a quick reminder of where we are in the session as our next steps um kind of play out so next slide please so really quickly this slide is already out of date um at the time that we put the presentation together there were 2 um 347 bills that have been introduced just in the last 24 hours another 147 I believe we're dropped um so we're closing in on probably close to 2500 Bills going to be introduced in just the beginning 30 days of session so not a lot to do um the other big thing that has happened in this session is to talk about a lot is that there are two what they've called 60-day gold for this legislative body one is on housing reflected in the fact that that is a priority of every caucus and the governor's office to come through they want to do a 60-day package on housing that is a quote-unquote down payment on what they want to accomplish in this session on housing um and then the semiconductor Workforce um their semiconductor joint committee is looking to figure out what they are prepared to implement to make ourselves as a State competitive for our partners that will be applying for tifac dollars um both at the as a state partner but also making sure that local governments are prepared to be a partner in the conversation as well and then the other big thing that has to happen in every long session if they call the odd years is the budget process for the state biennial budget um for state agencies and programs that the state runs and so that is a a very fun and exciting time for all of us to scramble up wait scramble up wait and then scramble and then they're done so with that next slide please getting into the hot topics and priority issues we're going to cover a little bit on the semiconductor first and then the housing and homelessness work that's being done those 60-day packages and then talk about our priority work in the ehf world um and then happy to pause after we get through those slides and make sure that there aren't topics that you all are interested in are hearing about that we did not include in the hot topics and priorities um and have conversation around what we know in the legislative there so next slide please so the semiconductor conversation this is also a somewhat out of David's play because there's nothing like staying on top of it with the state legislature um last week there was a reported in our memo to you a graph overview of what they were going to put into a so-called package and um it really only provides a two-part one was 200 million dollars um who created the pile of funding that could be applied for from a variety of Partners in the semiconductor space including Workforce Partners as well as businesses and those types that are kind of go after money or trying to get ready and then a second part of that package was the land use Authority where the governor would be allowed to do um not quite super exciting but some sort of uh site industrial site sighting I don't know exactly what to call it at this point and also it's been changed since it was introduced what was missing from that original draft package outline were anything related to the financial incentive that we have been eating on for example extension of Dean share um but also uh some folks the um our our city partners and their Enterprise own there and the long-term rural Enterprise Zone extensions as well as well as what the industry has been looking for in some sort of tax credit packages that can help them as they go after tips act dollars to show that there is a state partnership and investment of State dollars also not really included but sort of included indirectly in that 200 million dollars was really like Readiness financing 300 million dollars um all the different types of applications and or Partners in the tip um really doesn't go very far and site Readiness is going to talk a lot more than that and then finally um that Workforce package wasn't really explicitly drawn out in the in that draft package outline it was really kind of muddled in with that 200 million dollars which the terms of which really would not work for Workforce Development um to act that they wouldn't be able to meet the criteria that were established that would better match with our Private Industry partners that might attach to those dollars in the meantime what makes this slide out of date is ongoing conversations over the weekend about how to make fixes to some of these things um there's been a lot more work on what incentives can come into the package what are they considering low-hanging fruit is really kind of potentially just extending all of the deadline which um you know are all of the sunset on all of those local tax provisions and the game share it's not necessarily a modernization conversation quite yet we are working to see if that could be um brought into the initial package or if that's something that um need that legislature is trying to make most of their members comfortable with is becoming very sticky very fast um so that piece of that conversation has started there has been a bill introduced we don't know if it will go to the semiconductor industry or semiconductor committee um but that bill is uh Health Bill 3253 was dropped in the package today with all of those incentives having their Sunset extended among other things that are included in that bill um there has also been ongoing technical concerns grants with the Senate majority's Office or Senate president's office and the house speaker's office about what really needs to happen in that 200 million dollar fund um and all with explicit that revisions towards that Workforce portion we can't really justify bringing in um you know more companies if we can't have the workforce there and it's all levels of Workforce commitment that need to be made with their Workforce board with their Community College partners with our high schools with our um so looking at that and then much a little bit more clarification around what it needs to happen in that land use Authority and that process having a true functionality to it depending upon how it turns out in the final bill making sure that they understand zoning isn't the only concern that we have to undertake a lot of planning that goes with it and that the partners need to be brought to the table in order to have the conversations to make sure that whatever the governor's um election process works uh that it is considered what is going to take to make the capacity for the infrastructure to meet the needs so if I could pause wait because I know the time that we have for all of you is limited on the semiconductor topic and there's a housing one too and for each of these what I'm hoping is so I'll demonstrate it with this topic right now previously we were aware that there was like Federal deadline by the end of I think I have that right I'm also aware and I realized the camera angles are such that you can't see me holding up my arms so there's that Milestone then there's a milestone of end of session and I know after end of session that a special session can be so I have two scenarios one scenario is that we have those two Milestones with the different work session and chamber deadlines in between you get that and another scenario is not quite clear to me but what I'm trying to make sure is that we are at a level of Readiness to ensure that you can do the job that we've asked you to do so my question is this um you've let us know what the current bill from the governor the current package had you've given us a good flavor of how things are still in the other than these two Milestones I've already talked about do we just need to stay at the Readiness level that we talked about or are things moving such that we board members need to watch that semiconductor task force meeting every Monday and every Wednesday and be prepared that every Tuesday we might have to have a sync up on potential feedback letters or are are things going on track the way you need from us so thank you chair for that um clarifying question and um really keeping me on track here uh things are about to start hopefully moving even faster than being able to check in every few day almost so this is now I think tomorrow is the first day that they're going to be actually having public testimony related to the package and we need to be um prepared not just to do something in writing but perhaps have a commissioner prepared either come tomorrow or Monday to have that um presentation particularly focused on the game share component because that's something that's kind of been left since it was the first hearing and they haven't really cut back on it so um trying to get a sense of what the schedule is for tomorrow versus schedule for Monday so um to your point things are about to move",

        "text": " but we do have a lot of Housing and we do have a lot of areas that could provide more housing so there is interest at the state level in in having us be part of those requirements um so we'll know probably by the end of the year or at least by the the beginning of the next legislative session whether we'll be pulled into that or not and then finally the um HP 3197 uh the clear and objective standards limited to the urban growth boundary area that one is going to help with our significant natural resources project in the short term um but it does it had two sections to it um the second section was that by the middle of 2025 um some of the rural residential areas or regulations for housing in those areas also need to be clear and objective and um they so we do need to review those and make any corrections to those but we have a little bit more time so parts of all of that you will be seeing over the next couple years we just wanted to let you know about that and I think with that um that's the end of our presentation and we could answer any questions oh and sure you are muted foreign thank you questions not seeing any okay thank you Miss pelse and thank you Miss cherniak and I think we can move on our next item is uh we're going to address Court ordinance 897 and we'll have a staff presentation on that to start please all right and Todd borkowitz we'll give that presentation all right here we are uh so good evening chair Lockwood and PC members I'm as you know I'm Todd varkowitz associate planner and Community planning with the Department of land use and transportation so as you may recall uh we had drift you back on June 21st on two expansions to the urban growth boundary or egb in Washington County and today we'll be reviewing one of those expansions in ordinance 897 which is the Metro ugp expansion for tigards River Terrace 2.0 and so um here's a excuse me here's an outline of today's presentation so I'll provide a brief overview of Metro's 2020 uh 2023 Urban growth boundary land exchange that resulted in recent eqb expansion in Washington County to add River Terrace uh highlight the policy framework that prescribes what the county does after a Metro EGP expansion and finally describe ordinance 897 and its recommended Provisions for transferring uh the new ugp expansion area into the urban area like last time before I get too far into this presentation I just again want to stress that the County's role in UTV expansion is really Limited uh in Oregon YouTube expansion is primarily a city driven process that's done for well-defined state and Metro rules and counties primarily served to help ensure that a city's vision for urbanization through YouTube expansion can be so on that let's move on to the next so this shows the ugb land exchange which resulted in Metro Metro's ggp expansion in Washington County to add land known as River Terrace 2.0 now Metro was not statutory statutorily required to comprehensively review the Metro UTV through its six year cycle until 2024 however Tigard submitted a mid-cycle Amendment proposal for Two Urban Reserve areas or uras those were in River Terrace west and south that comprised of urban terrorist 2.0 and that area shown here in green Metro approved the expansion through a UTV land exchange an action that required removing a comparable amount of land a buildable land in Clackamas County from the Metro UTV that have not yet demonstrated Readiness for next slide please uh so the need for this ordinance is codified in Regional and uh County policy framework Title 11 of Metro's Urban growth management functional plan guides long-range planning for egb expansions and prescribes interim protection for these areas until local comprehensive plan amendments for the areas are complete at the county level policy one of the rural natural resource plan or rnrp requires that the ugb expansion area designations be transferred to the urban policy 18 of the comprehensive framework plan for the urban area or cfp requires application of the future development 20 acre District or fd20 be applied to all newly added Urban Land in order to protect and retain it for future Urban and then cfp policy 41 requires that new UTP expansions be added to the relevant community plan and the qualified resources be retained uh lastly section 308 of the Community Development code or CDC identifies uses allowed or prohibited in fd20 as well as dimensional requirements and other development standards next slide please so here is River Terrace 2.0 it's approximately 508 Acres 303 acres in River Terrace West and 205 in riverbridge Terrace South contains about uh 35 Lots so for this area tiger division is a complete neighborhood with Equitable Housing Opportunity accessible parks and open space diverse Transportation options supportive Commercial Services and employment opportunities and the needed infrastructure to support development those are tigers words next slide please so ordinance 897 makes changes to multiple comprehensive plan documents uh including the rural natural resource plan the full Mountain community plan as well as the Western Slope sub area that's part of that plan and the comprehensive framework plan for the urban area uh rural natural resource plan changes include removing designations for rural land uses and urban reserves and then transferring the map qualified resources the Bull Mountain community plan changes include adding the fd-20 land use designation on adding mapped significant natural resources and cultural resources as well as adding a Park parking maximum and then the primary change to the cfp is revising a map of future development areas in policy 41. next slide please so shown here properties within the river Taylor's 2.0 area currently have one of two rural land use designations Agriculture and Forest 20 acre District or af20 and that's in the northern portion the darker area or uh exclusive Farm use or efu in the middle and southern portion of the Ura so for to protect and retain land for future Urban Development and tell annexation to Tiger occurs the comprehensive plan requires that the future that the fd-20 designation be applied to all land added to the Metro UTP through legislative Amendment and as the name implies for that District the minimum lot area uh for fd-20 is 20 acres in most instances next slide please so the fd-20 land use designation that will be applied through this ordinance allows for farming to continue um and uh but uh with some minor that allows a detached dwelling unit and other developments for a type 1 to view that allows daycare facilities and certain home occupations through a type 2 director's decision and allows more certain intensive uses through a Type 3 procedure it also prohibits minor use is currently allowed in rural areas including feedlots in recreational marijuana next slide please so the staff recommends tonight that the PC conduct this conduct a public hearing and recommend approval of ordinance 897 to the Board of Commissioners uh board work session on this ordinance is scheduled for September 26th and the board ordinance hearings uh will start on October 3rd next slide that concludes my presentation and I'm happy to answer any questions thank you thank you very much do Commissioners have questions uh commissioner milliman what happens if we don't recommend approval it just goes to the board and they make their own decision I can answer that Todd if you have to go ahead yeah no go ahead so if if Noah actually gets taken that um that decision will get presented to the board but we do have a board hearing um that um we have noticed already that that will have to occur so we'll just form the board that you didn't make a decision and we'll provide a staff report explaining um any deliberations that the Planning Commission had communicating why the decision wasn't this this feels pretty administrative is that I mean it's like a decision that's been made that we get to participate in uh it is very administrative um but it is um it is something that requires a public hearing thanks for the presentation I like to you're welcome there's no commissioner I have a similar question like let's say the Board of Commissioners uh voted no with the land in the east side of the metro area stay in the urban growth boundary or what would happen then uh the land is already within the urban growth boundary it just doesn't have an urban designation to it so our comprehensive plan element requires that it uh be given that designation um a new land use designation in the and that the Kofi resources be transferred but again Metro um unlike what you're going to see for North Plains Metro had made that decision on the egb expansion already and um all appeals are have been finalized and so that is a uh that is a done decision at this point Mr will um if if uh passed and the property gets the fd-20 designation will it be like other areas uh that it'll sit and wait for like a master plan to get zoning or what's his future what what what's going to take uh in the future for it to go from fd20 to to something development the city in this case Tigard would need to uh actually uh develop comprehensive planning for it and that would need to be approved and um then from there it would it's really up to in this case the city of Tigard um when and how much of that they want to Annex so it could sit there we have many areas that have been designated ft 20. uh for many years and some areas get brought in and annexed uh by a city pretty quickly and what what we have heard from Tiger does their intention is to move quickly they do have a grant that's been approved from Metro to do the community um and so all of that is well underway well I have a couple questions one is a pretty small one on the Bull Mountain plan adding a parking maximum I was wondering what that was about so that is something that um we had uh or if previously that we currently um in in a to community plans however uh with new cfec rules we will likely not be or not be allowed to uh continue to have that parking maximum my understanding is that we will be removing that parking maximum designation from all Community plans likely at a later at a later time once the cfec rules are uh um have gone through uh the appeals process and uh and are finalized but but right now um we're just doing our due diligence um",

        "text": " map and take Community input as one of our ways to you know determine these disadvantaged communities so I think that fearing your experience with federal dollars at eweb actually makes me give me some concern that maybe they won't give us the flexibility we ask for but we'll see and that's one of those things we just have to wait for the usdoes response to our narrative to see how flexible we can be there yeah thank you Thomas and I know that we have someone on the phone who had a hand raise I wonder if he could bring them off mute can you hear me folks yes we can hi perfect perfect um hey this is Rohit Nair from Pacific Corp just had a great conversation uh appreciate the discussion just had a quick question regarding um buy America requirements um the Pacific Corp has made some you know group applications but as part of the uh proposal as part of the iij and the statute itself um uh for Prospect we can ask for an exemption and re-exempt it for from buy America but that might not necessarily be the case for formula grants is what I've been hearing any any thoughts on that um if utilities are going to be um to follow that by America Emily would you like to respond to this from odo's perspective I can give some general guidance on the approaching but I think this might be more about whether and it oh I'm sorry for the delay there um I don't know that we have um better guidance to give from our perspective than um Christy that you might have um I'm happy to speak to it yeah happy to jump in I just so my understanding is that yeah it is required there is a process for um a waiver and I you can submit one so there I don't it does have to be approved by usdoe it will have to go through Odo in order to correct but it is possible to apply for a waiver so we do have and Bryson if you haven't yet maybe we can share the website link to it we do have steps in guidance included for what applying for a waiver would look like um we can provide that link it's posted on odo's website and just kind of what steps you would have to take but it will have to be considered a wave of would have to be considered first by Odo Odo will submit it to usdoe and that's that's kind of the process it would take so we really we want to encourage it wherever we can it's really only an extreme case cases that we would consider it but the goal is to try to adhere to it as much as possible okay perfect no and uh just just a quick comment on that um so I was in uh Washington DC last week and I spoke with the good deployment office and also the individual from the White House of OMB who was responsible for reviewing the um the exemption request for by America so there is going to be some guidance that is going to come up uh and some instructions on what what process or steps to follow to request for that exemption through the good deployment office for the formula grant my my question was also yes I really appreciate you providing some clarification on that and I you know we'll take a look at uh odo's kind of process to request that exemption uh the follow-up to that question was uh is that going to be part of the start of the auto scoring metrics right so for example you know if you see a competitiveness on two good projects but one one project has more foreign sourced material versus the second one which has uh more by America inclined material so does that uh do you anticipate that to play a factor into determining which project gets the funding would you also if you have immediate thoughts we did things I was like nobody has thought of that but now it's on the list of considerations so one of the things that we did talk about um and I think through the application process so we don't we can't give you a firm answer yes this is required and no this is not I this is a federal requirement you know we only have so much control over that but I think one of the things we tried to do and discuss is put together um in our scoring criteria there's an option for it you know do they have a thoughtful plan to demonstrate that they will have the capacity to implement this throughout their project so it's not that you have to in your application be able to say yes we are going to do it this is how we're going to do that and have that developed you can still apply we'll look at all of the different factors of the project this will be one of them um and then you know we will work with you we will kind of you know build this with you to say like okay have you thought through what the constraints are what the conditions will take what steps he'll take to try to mitigate them I'm kind of build that out through the application and conversation process I think that answers it perfectly yeah thank you thank you for those questions um and I do think I will say you know I think that goes back to the selecting criteria piece as well as you know these are federal regulations there is only so much we can do and have so much control you know how would you weight them or what would you consider in developing this criteria what should that look like um and how should we weight them so if there's no other questions right now maybe we move on to the last couple um tables here again these are specific to a program that we've got up and running that at a certain you know step 40 requirements from the Oriental legislature but on this one I'd like to point out letter k project assists applicant in achieving goals in a natural Hazard mitigation um this is where we might be able to address the projects that are contributing to Emergency Response within a community something like this I think can bring out those Community benefits associated with The Disaster Response so just wanted to highlight that long here's some more of the benefits associated with cost savings Economic Development sounded like we were getting to a place um you know very low population service territories where costs for upgrades are socialized amongst a less smaller group of great payers but there may be some value in trying to identify projects that you know minimized rate impacts for utility and then finally we have the geographic and technological diversity now there representing five percent of the points in the program I think that we would like to having a means of spreading projects around what I'm doing like healthy or utility service territory that we wanted applications to run for utility and then they you know next round they can come back again I don't know there's ways we could do that but um yeah I think with that we can maybe move into just a discussion about what the criteria should look like they've got a lot of happiness we have identified at least two main bodies of criteria one is describing technical viability one is describing Community benefits we can add other discussions to this as well but with that um you know we have these prompting questions first one what criteria should we include and how can we score it and then kind of a process question um how can we make this as easy as possible or constrained staff to come in and apply be Sonic work so so I have a quick question 85th or columbia-based electric is is Oregon Department of energy contemplating two separate application processes one for large utilities that are going to fit under the large utilities since that's pretty limited on the number of utilities and they can be identified pretty easily right and then and then there's everybody else I and and I wasn't sure if that was what you were contemplating on that side um or not because truly the evaluation process is going to be completely different I I think not completely different that's not fair but the projects are going to be in looking at them I would assume it's a really good question and it came up yesterday and and on one level we would like the ability to move funds between the two pots of money and in this case we actually have four utilities because you can tell uh qualifies as a large net four million megawatt hours per year has been cut off and so you know if we had common criteria and let's just say the ious in some scenario went out and found their money from some other Federal sources only one came and they said we needed a million dollars and it leaves 8 million on the table in the rest of the program we would want the co use to be able to go in and compete for those funds in that round but the way that the federal requirements set up this program it's based on percent of customers served and so these the larger utilities essentially have a carve out because of the very large percentage of customers so I would put that question to the table and see if you have thoughts on that I I think a trilateral I think I think what you're going to see is the large utilities because we can't duplicate efforts across federal and state funding applications we're going to carve all types of projects for each so it's not I don't think you're going to see a Pacific War or Idaho or even the Nutella not put in good projects under the state program so it's I think there can be a lot of opportunity to like ship funds you know yeah aggressive too the the split was right around 13 and seven for the funds with the 40 carve out which was you know considerably higher than the share of customers and we made that argument in the narrative development um so I think that's something we're going to have to continue to work on but we would like to maintain flexibility in the larger budget to move between pots and the other way could happen too where cou say it's more trouble than it's worth and and then we have funds that we can put in the other direction you know there's scenarios that we need to plan for in the program so as long as we have that flexibility um manage the budget I think we'll be open to further ideas I I think that you're I think you'll be over subscribed if I'm a betting person I'm going to put all my money from all the other programs so far is they're all over subscribed yeah right there's just so much meat out there so much you know need for yeah in this work that we haven't been able to go to yeah and and what are the benefits of this um and I I think I've discussed this before when you're talking about matching funds at at 33",

did not offer any rationale so right now we're still in circuit court and uh we are uh deciding whether to just stay there and argue whe you know present the case there or once again Ask the Supreme Court to take it up that has yet to be determined what what our next step will be that was interesting thank um yes councelor buyer so is there a statutory fix to the what do we do with appeals of contested cases or do we just wait to see how this shakes out I I have recommended to the department that they go to the legislature and ask for a statutory fix and that's that's up to the department as to whether or not that they'll do that okay thank you it just it seems like this could come up again yeah yeah and we are looking into that question now thank you Council row um so the next item is the wagon trail solar Council review of the draft proposed order it's an information item and Chase McVey Walker senior sighting policy analyst will take the floor here okay good morning chair how uh members of the council morning for the record my name is Chase McVey Walker senior setting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy today to's agenda as chair how just mentioned is council's review of the draft proposed order for the wagon trail solar project application for site certificate um today's agenda item is an opportunity for the council to provide comments to staff on the draft proposed order and the issues raised on the record of the public hearing um for staff consideration in the proposed in hopes of uh appropriately organizing my presentation I will first uh briefly describe the proposed site and facility and the procedural history and then we'll provide an overview of the draft proposed order and uh the comments received during the DPO comment period I'll do my best to adequately address and characterize each issue brought up um and will allow Council to discuss and provide recommendations on those issues and to be clear today's agenda Item B is not an action item it's simply an information item and an opportunity for Council to provide comments to staff for consideration in the proposed order next please oh yeah so this slide is is the overview I just went over um next slide okay the wagon trail uh solar project is proposed solar photovoltaic energy uh generation facility proposed by Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC whom is the applicant the applicant is a wholly owned indirect subsid area of next era energy Resources LLC the proposed facility would permanently occupy up to 3,685 Acres of private exclusive Farm use Zone land located within a site boundary of Acres the proposed site would be located entirely in in north central Morrow County near the near Lexington Oregon related in supported proposed related and supporting facility components include a 500 megawatt lithium ion energy storage system uh two collector substations a 345 kilovolt collection system and operations in maintenance 0.6 miles of 230 KV transmission line four met met meteorological stations met stations and four construction staging areas the next slide I've uh called out where the location of these components next slide please oh I guess not um okay well we'll go to the next slide then oh this is no this is fine procedural history okay well the procedural history for the wagon trail solar project um starts on November 3rd 2020 when the department received the notice of intent to file an application for site certificate for the proposed facility on November 20th 2020 the council appointed the Morrow County Board of Commissioners as special Advisory Group for the proposed facility and on November 25th following the noi receed the department issued a public notice of the noi in January of 2021 the department held a public information meeting um and then on June the second line here on June 11th 2021 the applicant submitted an amended noi to the department to address site boundary modifications and subsequently the department issued a a public notice of the amended noi then in August of 2022 the department received the preliminary application for site certificate the department issued additional requests for or requests for additional information in November 2022 February 2023 and December 23 to which the applicant responded to after reviewing the applicants responses um the department determined that the pasc the preliminary application for site certificate to be complete on December 22nd 2023 and following that completeness determination the applicant filed a complete application for site certificate on January 3rd of this year 24 on May 7th the department issued the DPO for the wagon trail solar project which initiated a 31-day comment period chair how conducted a public hearing on the DPO at last month's fsec meeting on May 30th at the portoro riverr center in Borman Oregon uh and the record record was kep the the deadline for the public comment period was June 7th but the record was kept open until June 10th for the applicant to respond to comments received on June 10th which was this past Monday the applicant requested an extension until May uh June 11th a 24hour extension to respond to the and we're here now on June 14th uh with FX review of the DPO and the public comments next slide please okay this is a uh a a process chart that I'm sure everyone here is familiar with this is the energy facility sighting process uh application for a site certificate chart there's seven major steps to the ASC sighting process the first being the notice of intent followed by the project order the application uh step which includes the preliminary application and complete application and then the fourth step which is uh highlighted with the red rectangle is where we are today at the draft proposed order um generally the draft proposed order is the organ Department of Energy's initial findings of facts conclusions of Law and recommendations to Council on whether or not the facility would comply with all and following the public hearing Council reviews the draft proposed order during a council meeting and based on direction from Council Odo in The Next Step would o would issue a proposed order and a notice of contested case the proposed order is staff's recommendations based on comments received and for the contested case the second to last step only those persons who raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing or in writing by the common deadline on the draft proposed order May participate in the contested case the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer and following the contested case process FC will review the hearing officer recommended contested case order and uh issues a final order approving or denying the applications for a site certificate and that is the last step of the process next slide please this slide is representative of council's scope of review as I mentioned earlier today is an opportunity for the council to provide comments to staff on the DPO and the issues raised on the record of the public hearing the next step in the process will be for the Department to issue a proposed order taking into consideration the comments of the council and comments on the record the hearing of the draft proposed order and any agency consultation in conjunction with the issuance of the proposed order the department will issue a notice of case are there any does council have any questions for me at this point on scope of review yep councelor IES um I just want to thank thank you Chase um I just wanted to make mention the okay um thank you Chase um I just wanted to make comment of the very short turnaround for Council um for the review process um I didn't get a chance to review all of the cont comments just because of the very short time frame um and so I just wanted to um mention that to the counil and um see if how everybody else felt about the review process this time around um I feel like I was not able to adequately review all of the material and really give um good feedback for the process so just want to make that known thank you um secretary cornette for the record Todd cornette um just for kind of clarification um yeah this was a sort of a tight turnaround in terms of the time frame between the last council meeting and this and then obviously the public comment time frame deadline and then the response by the uh applicant so essentially you know we want to make make sure that it was on this agenda so you could to at least begin reviewing it but ultimately it is your choice whether you feel youve had enough time to review information I think it's worthwhile for Chase to go through and do the entire presentation and I think once he concludes that you can have some conversations and decide if you feel like you've had enough information based on the on the presentation to evaluate the comments and the responses and provide your responses to us great you can do that we'll move forward um if you only feel like you had the ability to deal with some of them but not all of them you can simply not conclude this agenda item and continue it to the next council meeting um that's entirely within your choice thank you secretary cornette yeah I was okay with the short turnaround knowing that this was review Only If This Were a action item then it would have been tight but um I'm okay with um proceeding with the review and I think we'll be able to get into the details with this review and I think that will help uh councelor IMS a lot in understanding what the issues are and then um if we still need some more time we you can ask for that and we'll get it so thank you okay okay back to okay thank you next please for the record Chase MC Bay um so during the DPO public comment period uh which was a 31-day comment period spanning May 7th through June 7th uh there was a public hearing held on May 30th and at the public hearing uh um four public commenters uh provide a testimony and one reviewing agency and we also received during thei prior to the deadline of the comment period we received two written comments one from one one being a public comment and one being of a reviewing agency and as I mentioned the certificate holder responded to all of the comments ments um this past Tuesday on June 11th and all of the comments and the reviewing agents uh and the applicants response to comments were provided to Council in the supplemental staff",

least 10% below buildings constructed under the base building code uh then we have incentives for early and voluntary adoption of commercial building performance standards these rules are currently under development by Odo um there heat pump incentives these are our community heat pump incentives program and our rental heat pump incentives program both of which are administered by the Oregon Department of energy and then weather resistance weatherization assistance for existing residential buildings and then in the materials and waste category we have three measures um first uh grants to reduce embodied carbon in buildings through building reuse and space efficient housing um second grants for food Waste Recovery and infrastructure and third grants for landfill gas controls so all of these measures are eligible to seek funding through a cprg implementation Grant we're in the process of developing this application we're still making Final determinations on our funding requests so we're not ready to share any information on the amount of funding that we're intending to seek for any of these measures or for the program as a whole at this point but we are planning to come back to you next month and give you a full update on our application happy to answer any questions if any Commissioners have them um while also acknowledging that I'm I may not be able to to provide full and complete answers at this time any questions for Amy thank you here McDonald I just wanted to add one more thing which was uh to compliment the DEQ staff and to Amy in particular and Morgan and Whitney and who just did uh really Yan's work pulling this off in a very very short period of time it's very complicated to put together a grant in a a couple of months for $200 million they did a great job and and uh I think I I hopefully we'll be really successful and you're going to get it in a day early as well just kidding maybe two oh good excellent well thank you it's great to um to hear about that it's a huge opportunity for the state to move some things forward uh and take advantage of the funding that uh the federal government is making available to through the EPA so um really great to to see Oregon stepping up on that uh one thing uh of interest to folks that may want to see what other states uh are up to in terms of their priority climate action uh plans uh they are all posted epa's uh clean climate pollution reduction Grant um Pages or you can navigate to all the state plans that were submitted as well as the plans that were submitted by um Metropolitan areas so and tribes so great to see a lot of those um uh available to to get ideas uh of what folks are working on in states any any last questions for Amy or okay then we can turn things over to Todd Cornett uh from Odo he's going to uh talk to us about the energy sighting facility process in Oregon um you may recall the discussions that we had when we were developing the road map to 2030 really emphasized the importance of being able to stay on track uh with the programs that were already in place and um this is uh particularly important this topic uh given uh the clean energy law the state's clean energy law 2021 and so I thought it would be good for us to do a quick refresher on the process that uh facilities have to go through to uh be approved in Oregon and then I think at Future meetings it would be great to hear from the utilities on and from uh the department of energy uh about the state energy strategy and how that may be all um influencing how the state uh addresses the the clean energy husp 2021 so with that I'll turn things over to Todd all right thank you chair McDonald and members of the commission can yep perfect uh actually go back one slide please yeah um so yeah my name is Todd cornette I'm the assistant director for sighting at the Oregon Department of energy uh and so I manage the energy facility sighting division uh I also the secretary to the energy facility sighting Council so I'm going to give you a pretty high level overview of the state sighting process today but happy to follow up with any questions later on or provide me more detail um at a future meeting uh if you would like next slide please um so you can see the statute on the slide um so the state sighting of energy projects goes back to the uh 1950 um but the program that we have in place now actually started in the early 1970s um and it really what we do is Incorporated in the policy um on the slide and that's essentially to balance the need and value of large scale energy projects so for the production and transmission of energy um as well as to evaluate um and mitigate the potential negative impacts of these projects to both the built and natural environment so these are some of the bigger infrastructure projects in the state so in addition to being important and valuable they could also be quite negative and impactful um if not done uh correctly so next slide please so some of the basics about the program um so the energy facility sighting council is a seven member uh Governor appointed and legislature confirmed uh board they're volunteers they are the decision makers on all applications amendments uh and rul makings um the sighting division or one um component of the Oregon Department of energy we have 13 positions and we do the majority of the analysis writing coordination day-to-day work associated with uh reviewing projects and ultimately making recommendations to the energy facility sighting Council so the process is designed to be a One-Stop shop um people often times s talk about takes a long time and you know it costs money but it's also because we incorporate um all the state agency uh reviews uh local government reviews it's a much more significant and robust process than the local government process um and so the values are that it's all done in one place that eliminates duplication of process eliminates uh different timelines different appeal processes uh and even if those uh individual reviews would have resulted in you know all approvals those could be uh contradictory in terms of what gets approved and maybe what the conditions are associated with those various approvals so the idea is that this is a One-Stop shop um it does make it bigger and more complicated um but it also there's a lot of value in doing that as well the track tracking for the public is easier um the participation by state agencies so as part of our process we have what are called reviewing agencies um those are pretty much all the natural resource agencies uh state agencies um all the tribal governments that are identified um as could be affected by the project or a particular project as well as the local governments uh within whose jurisdictions project is located those are all um designed to be part of our process we rely on them is subject expertise um and they we rely pretty heavily upon them and coordinate significantly with them um our process is standards-based so what that means is we have a set of standards and it is the burden of the applicant to prove through the record through the information they provide on the record that they meet each of the standards um and you one of the differences you know people often will compare us to NEPA one of the elements of NEPA the National Environmental Policy Act at federal government level is the lead Federal agency can propose the project in a location different than the applicant actually proposes it for us we can't do that so we have to review what is submitted um and that either you know meets the standards or it doesn't based upon the information so when you look at our process um some of the language that we have I think it confuses people because some of it sounds like the NEPA process but when you actually look at it it functions much more like the Oregon's land use system Oregon's land use system is a standards based process applicants have to submit information again they have to prove that they meet those requirements in order to get an approval so we're much more oriented to the state land use system than the NEPA system uh once a project is approved if it's approved uh they are given the developer given a site certificate functionally that's a permit but it does have some different legal implications it's more of a business contract between the state of Oregon the energy facility sighting Council on behalf of the state of Oregon and the certificate holder um and then finally on this slide uh we are uh fully fee funded in terms of our review process so applicants pay for the entirety of our cost um that includes Staffing the Department of Justice uh any cost associated with the energy facility sighting Council and any reimbursement to State agencies local governments and tribal governments who help us in our review of projects so next slide please so while people mostly focus on our applications uh and amendments um there are really three main components of what we do um and the first is applications and amendments that's where we spend probably the majority of our time and most people sort of see us doing that um but we have two other components as well uh one of those is compliance so from you know from the point that a project is approved all the way through the time that it is decommissioned and removed from the landscape we evaluate all the conditions associated with each phase preconstruction construction operation and retirement and our compliance staff evaluate each one of these projects uh at least annually to ensure that it is complying with the um conditions of approval and you can see in the background slides sometimes bad things do happen uh with projects um so and that can take more time and more effort to kind of deal with those incidences that occur um and thirdly we have our own Ru making um program so the energy facility sighting Council has different rules than the Oregon Department of energy and the authority of those rules fall to the energy facility sighting Council so we have our own rule making coordinator and we have a pretty aggressive rule making program to uh evaluate different um either procedural or substantive rules on an annual basis to try to make our process more clear and better for all participants next slide so before a state jurisdictional facility can be built in Oregon the developer has to apply for a site certificate um but which facilities and what size of facilities come to the energy facility sighning Council are basically established through the",

        "text": "it looks like it is welcome everybody to the Oregon energy code stakeholder panel session December 13th and uh we'll kick it off here in just a moment just wanted to remind you that the meetings being recorded and that we seek all of your input and we'd like to hear from just everybody that's on at certain times I'll go ahead and switch over to the main screen here and show you the agenda it's a lengthy agenda this time we have several topics and which will slice up the uh meaning quite a bit if we could just wait for questions and answers after each topic that you see here after commercial adoption ashtray training those sort of things then we can get to those questions and answers at that point in time at the end I'll do a quick wrap up and talk about that that date March 14th what we uh how everybody feels about that date it looks like it's good on on this end um so let's get started and with that want to kick it off over to Mark Heiser from building codes division he'll be talking about Commercial Code adoption take it away mark okay let's forward to the next slide uh just a quick note for everyone um the status of the commercial energy code adoption rule um it's been through the board and the rulemaking hearing is upcoming on December 20th at 9 30 a.m some of the key elements um like to review sort of what the division has been uh and promise for some time is that the way the adoption will happen is as soon as the uh latest ashrae 90.1 becomes available within 180 days of publication of course you have to worry about scheduling of the energy board to give them notice but to let to begin the process of reviewing the latest 90.1 will happen within 180 days of the publication of the latest um and then within the intent is that within 90 days of the US Department of energy issuing their final determination or no later than one year after the publication date of the most recent 90.1 BCD will be presenting the latest 90.1 um of course modified using the organ Energy Efficiency specialty code document to the construction energy industry energy board for adoption um again we like to make sure that if we go to the next 90.1 that Comcheck will be available um for 90.1 2022 we've already had a discussion with the folks at Department of energy pnnl who take care of the software and it looks like they'll be more than ready um in the coming year excuse me how to clear my throat and so potentially it could be available you know sometime early if if 90.1 is um we've been promised uh at least the ashrae staff have been saying you know it's hopefully coming out before the end of this year um that something could potentially happen by um early to mid middle of 2024 actually for the use of 90.1 again this will be a little bit before the publication of the iecc 2024. um currently for the coming year the construction industry energy board dates are scheduled for sometime in February uh June 13th and October 17th thanks Richard hi Roger I'm sorry yeah all right so the next slide is about Azure training take it away mark um there is a um what's new presentation coming from ashrae in the department of energy to sort of go over um what is coming and and sort of would want to give people a heads up look for this you may want to to attend because I'll give you an idea of what will be coming for the next organ energy code they're going to be covering items uh on to cover what's new in for the envelope um we know of a lot of the things that are already in there information on air leakage rates um we think there will be new thermal bridging criteria that may not may be in the final document um there we'll be looking at something called a total system performance path lighting of course once again lots of updates to the lighting power density tables some new recommended practices information on Horticultural lighting more guidance on energy costs budget in other words the modeling performance paths on will be covered and let's see here the prescriptive requirements for on-site renewable energy in 90.1 and also looking at there's something new this time around they are doing an energy credits for sort of additional measures like we have here for our residential and like Washington has all righty Roger any yes that's it thanks Roger any questions for Mark regarding either the commercial adoption rule or ashrae training now is the time to ask those let's see here okay I put the link to that training event in the chat for anybody who wants it anyone who wants to attend a training on a Sunday bring on those questions about new Horticultural lighting requirements all right well I'm not hearing any questions and I think it's time to move on at that um Blake shelite is here to talk to us about Federal funding funding summary the infrastructure act and jobs act and the inflation reduction act Blake are you ready yeah yeah uh thanks Roger um you can go ahead and go to the next slide I think um so if folks were present a few weeks ago we gave a similar summary to the resilient efficient buildings task force on some of this funding that's coming down the line for the inflation reduction act we know there's a lot of a lot of federal funding coming down the line and we kind of gave a quick overview about how some of this funding might apply to buildings um in particular so um this is kind of a review of that same summary that we gave um before but I thought it would be topical to give to this group too um so this slide kind of presents just a quick overview of the the funding buckets that are in the inflation reduction act or IRA and their timelines and then how much funding is available under each one of those programs and then we'll kind of go over each one of these um there's a slide free for each one so you can kind of get a good picture of the of the overview here and just the the amount of funding that's coming um you know not just Oregon's way but but every State's way really um yeah go ahead go to the next slide so one of the first buckets of funding that applies in the residential sector is this this homes program you know there's always a good acronym associated with with all these programs so this is the home energy performance um whole house rebate program and there's kind of a couple different Pathways under this program but you know generally it's it's for existing buildings and it um is based on either a measured performance or a model performance from energy uh efficiency measure or combination of measures um that gets implemented and depending on the amount of reduction so it kind of starts at for the model pathway it starts at a 20 performance and then up to the 34 threshold below 35 homes are able to get up to uh two thousand dollars per home or two hundred thousand dollars per multi-family building up to fifty percent of project um and then that amount doubles for low and moderate income folks um then if you achieve the next tier of energy performance 35 savings or greater um under the model pathway those incentive amounts those Grant amounts essentially double from the lower tier so up to four thousand dollars per home um or eight thousand dollars for a low moderate income home and then the second pathway is the measured pathway and then that energy saving threshold is for anything that's 15 or greater um and um that one can um you know either be up to two thousand dollars for twenty that's tied to the 20 reduction level for the energy use per single family per like average single family home or dwelling unit as applicable and that's something that'll need to be determined through implementation of the program up to 80 of project cost um and then that could double up to four thousand dollars for the LMI pathway so uh next oh then there's there's 4.3 billion dollars of total funding uh for that program um go back one slide real quick Roger because that that amounts on there so 4.3 billion of total funding Nationwide under this program and Oregon as a state will get um over 50 million of that funding they've kind of announced the specific funding amounts I think it's around 56 or 57 million dollars uh next slide so this funding will be distributed through State energy offices and um every state Energy Office you know Otto included we'll have to submit an application with a plan to implement the the homes review program so it's not competitive funding it's kind of formula based but we you know states do still have to send a plan with a number of criteria for how how we would Implement that program um and then one other thing I'll just point out here is that there is a 200 um that's able to be provided to contractors that um that do work in a home located in a disadvantaged community so next slide under that plan and under that state submit states can increase the amount of rebates for LMI you know up to that kind of Maximum I guess um and the state energy offices can also use up to 20 percent of the grant amount for planning Administration or technical assistance to to actually implement the uh the savings and then just because there are a number of funding uh streams funding buckets underneath this there is underneath the IRA they do provide some Provisions that there's no double dipping across the federal grants for the same upgrades but that doesn't necessarily mean that a single project and so it's for the same project across the grants um you know you could use the grants for two different projects um but it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't a project couldn't utilize for example the homes Grant and a tax credit a federal tax credit for the same project or homes Grant and a local state or utility or other program incentive for the same project it's just the federal grants can be combined for the same project and then obviously not combined through all the incentives over 100 of the project cost um still some to be determined like definitions of disadvantaged communities um and I think we're all still kind of awaiting in general a lot of guidance from the from the usdoe and our other Federal agency partners on on a lot of these funding streams so next slide so the next program under the IRA is the high efficiency electric homes rebate program this one provides in",

        "text": " it's only a two-page document we've scheduled 45 minutes for this part of the meeting and so we've got plenty of time and i'm just going to read it as we go because it is brief and that way for those who haven't had a chance to review we'll have a chance to do that now so the following questions are meant to the community renewable energy program advisory committee's role going forward by establishing a charter as a reminder the advisory committee was established within house bill 2021 with a direction to provide consultation on the implementation of sections 29-32 and um you know that essentially is the entire program those are the sections within the bill that describe the entire program so we really started out as an advisory committee on rules but now we are on to the other sections of this program and we really want to make sure that this program continues to operate in a way that is serving all of the communities in the best way possible so that's what we want to talk about now the the goals moving forward draft goal statement the primary goals of the community renewable energy grant program are to provide grants to encourage community renewable energy projects that support resilience and environmental justice communities the input and engagement of this advisory committee in developing the draft rules when the program was first created in has fostered close communication and collaboration with the department and communities that will help make the program goals successful a broad purpose of this advisory committee is to continue to be engaged and informed of the program implementation and operations to support community outreach reporting and possible future program rule changes so first question is do we feel that we've captured high-level goals and purposes of the program and committee roles in that opening all right this stand to get things started i i think you have all right thanks stan and thanks for for breaking the ice this is alessandra i i believe so too all right moving on well i have one question this is les perkins um just looking at the language uh the broad purpose of the advisory committee is to continue to be engaged informed of the program implementation um and possible future program rule changes uh so is the purpose of the committee just to be engaged and informed or is the purpose of the committee to actually uh to be helping to shape uh any future program real definitely helping if you want me to jump in since i helped to draft this um yeah okay great so last i think that's a great question i think we're open to ideas on like how to describe very broadly in this short paragraph what the purpose is and then get into some more specific activities and duties later but one thing that we've noticed in prior incentive programs that the agency ran tax credits and whatnot that having a group of um people who are really informed about the program as it works or doesn't work well as we need to make improvements there a strong benefit in having a more consistent set of people to stay with the program so that you know that this this um the bill creating this program requires some reporting on like how it's going and having a group of people like through an advisory committee to help us knowing the answer to that question and then potentially thinking about improvements over the course of the life of the program um is sort of a lesson learned and something that did not happen at the agency in prior incentive and felt like that's an improvement we could do in establishing this one we also have a couple of sister agencies deq that kind of follows that and have seen more engagement and partners and kind of thinking about what what the program could do offering up either that land and reporting because perhaps it requires sort of the legislature to become involved if they want to make a more um like a change in statute if that's what's necessary or if that's something the agency can consider through program rule so it's sort of like broadly could be both does that make sense it does i was just looking for clarification and in the list of proposed activities um the word support uh could have a lot of different meanings so i just wasn't i wasn't sure if the if the idea is that this group will be helping to inform you know potential changes or needs for changes or if the group is simply used as a sounding board i think it could be both and maybe that is something we could make more specific in the in that part of the charter um you know i think that this could be a forum where ideas for um improvements could be raised and then the agency can think about whether that's possible through existing um language or but and or budget allocated or if that's something that is maybe an idea worth vetting and putting in the report that's required on how the program is going to the legislature so i think that both of those are potential ways to sort of act on that purpose thank you great question yeah so maybe we could have um in that first paragraph something a broad purpose of the advisory committee is to can you continue to be engaged informed and provide recommendations or provide you know something where there's an advisory role inherent in the discussion even though engaged potentially has that built in we do want to recognize that we we look to this committee for for advice and so um but i think as we get into that next list of activities it's pretty clear that we are going for the for the support from the committee so that was a good catch less thank you so next below is a proposed list of activities and duties a provide recommendations regarding program implementation and operations support community outreach and i see that kuisha just provided a comment i believe in the it flashed up and i missed it but it's in there b support community outreach and this is one where we really need your help c provide contacts of key stakeholders within your communities d is support possible future program rule changes so when we launch this program in march and we see how how the applications roll in obviously have the opportunity to make changes to the program as we go to make sure that we're really serving the communities that we're trying to serve and that the goals of the program are being met and finally support program reporting and reporting for a program like this potentially a few meetings meanings one is the statutorily required reporting that's in the bill but also internally within odo we're going to have a lot of reporting and metrics that were that we're following throughout the program to make sure that we're on track and um so supporting in all manner of reporting within the program is going to be any thoughts on that list can you define a little bit more like within your communities are we talking just stakeholders or what was the thought there i can start rob if you want to um you know one of the things that we were wondering if this committee and the folks on here would be interested in supporting is helping us to share information with the network that you have so that um hopefully would be able to reach more communities as you know the program is very much directed to serve serve communities but we acknowledge that the oregon department of energy may not have all of the information about who those communities are and have the sort of best methods of outreach and are hoping that you all might be interested in supporting us with the network that you have and the organizations that you work so at a very high level that's kind of where the idea came from but i think it could benefit from some more specificity in a charter too yeah thanks for the clarification that's what i thought i just wanted to i doing that but i wanted to make sure that i wasn't missing something yeah maybe that's some the type of language we could add um to a draft of this that kind of gives that specificity a bit more yeah and i think when we get down to the next few questions we can help build that out um because the precise role for committee members presumably it differs for different committee members depending on how they kind of represent communities or in some cases state agencies or whatever the case may be i think we'll find that committee members all have different ways of reaching out and we want to make sure that we support that in the charter and you know kind of cover cover all all contingencies of what we would be hoping to get out of you know committee support on this outreach piece following the list there's a statement describing the report that is statutorily required the director of the state department of energy shall submit a biennial report to the legislative assembly and this is a report that describes the money spent to date status of projects both completed and and um you know looking at the metrics around especially the budget carve outs that are in the bill um 50 or more to qualifying communities 50 or more to energy resilience projects the reporting that we do to the legislature is going to going gonna track all of those things so i think i'll move on to the questions one or i guess it's two this is a running list how do you feel about the i think we heard from les have an opportunity to get a little more specific around the community outreach piece and the role any other thoughts about that list yeah rob this is alessandra um a question around to support the community outreach is does oh does the department of energy intend to send us like summaries or powerpoints um basically create like contest concise materials um so that we can conduct that community outreach you know to to make materials digestible to community members and that's a really good question and we are we do intend to have marketing kind of collateral materials that we develop internally we have some power points that we've already developed which we are happy to share right now that are that describe the the makeup of the um in a fairly broad sense they were written as the rules were being brought we're also working on one pagers for announcing the planning grants and also the construction grants one of the things that we were hoping to do was to develop materials that are targeted a little more um directly to specific communities and so we might have a separate um one pager for construction projects with tribes than we would for a construction project for a consumer-owned utility trying to develop a whole catalog of materials that can be shared and distributed according to the target audience is one of our goals um it's something that i think will we would love advice on you know we have we have a a good communications team within odo but we're not a we're not a marketing firm and so any any thoughts and advice on materials is always welcome i don't know if there's",

The sited location has been identified and administration is currently meeting with Central Florida College to work out a lease agreement and we are working with the architectural team to work on sketches and build out. Any questions on that? And that's for the location right here. Yes, ma'am. Gotcha. Any questions on risk and benefits? I think we're good. Just that tie, my grandfather's tie. Was that on purpose? For today, I mean. Yes, ma'am. I. Very interesting. Thank you. And finally, the wellness budget can be found on page 667 of your budget book. Staff continue to implement wellness programs. Excuse me. We continue to promote the employee assistance program with increased emphasis on mental health education and the addition of mental health first aid training, as well as a peer support platform which is rolling out any day now. They've done put a lot of time in with public relations to get that, to get that happening. Additionally, we've kind of changed how we're spending our dollars. We're focusing more on train the trainer. So, for example, Miss Sean went through and received training in how to stop the bleed so she can provide that training to our departments and that will save an outside expense. This coming year, we're looking at getting her certified as a CPR instructor again. That will help. She can go to the different departments and provide the needed training. The wellness budget has a decrease of $14,227 overall. This is a reduction of contracted services and it does include a new increase for new software and the CIP funding was reduced. I would also like to acknowledge the changes that our wellness coordinator has implemented. She's doing weekly reports, live video functions. We're working on setting, doing a video message for open enrollment for the people who were at the different libraries. And then I included some of the wellness by the numbers for year to date. For this fiscal year to date, number of new cards issued is 195. Number of workouts by sign in 882. Number of class participants 257. And average number of visits per week is 55. We're seeing some good improvements over there. Any questions? I think we're good. Thank you. Thank you all. That's going to take us to Michelle Hearst, our 911 management director. Better than you? I think so. You hear that, Sarah? Commissioner Zalick said that she thinks. He thinks that you're better than Amanda. Yeah, I mean, her presentations were never that good. I don't think that's true. We'll have to check the tape. They were never that nice. Good morning. Good morning. Michelle Hearst, 911 Management director. Good morning, Chairman Stone and commissioners. I believe my budget falls on the page 310. As the director of the 911 management department, I'm grateful for the opportunity to present the proposed annual budget for fiscal year 24 25. I would like to extend my thanks for your continued support of our department and mission. Your support enables us to excel in providing countywide 911 system addressing and emergency services mapping. I would like to highlight a few key requests from my proposed budget. Firstly, I'm requesting a 911 specialist position to be reclassified to a 911 operations manager. Given the increased workload and my frequent obligations out of the office, the need for a dedicated manager has become increasingly evident. I've identified an individual for this role as part of my succession plan. This person consistently steps up to lead, embodies the high card values and is respected by her peers. As for my line item accounts, my repairs and maintenance of equipment has increased to cover the logging recorder maintenance for the Ocala police Department. That's going to be an expenditure that's going to be reimbursed by the city every year. And for my operating supplies, this account has increased due to the necessity of replacing our chairs in our office. I believe the last time we replaced them was when I first got hired 26 years ago. They're really breaking down. And lastly, aligning with the strategic plan, I'm ready to begin the process of migrating to next generation 911. And to initiate this transition, I will be bringing you a contract for next generation core services to begin that process. And I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Anyone? Go ahead. I mean, I'm just curious from your perspective or what from the next gen part is going to affect you and your process. Well, it will change our service provider. The provider that I've chosen is different than Lumen, and it's all they do. They only provide next gen core services. Okay. So it will increase those location capabilities. And will the citizens see anything or will fire services see anything different? The communication centers will. They'll see much improved location accuracy. It'll be amazing. It'll also enable them to accept video, live streaming pictures from scenes, all kinds of stuff. So that has to be vetted with them and management to see, you know, who would have access to those videos and stuff. Would it just be the first responders responding to the scene or just supervisors? And does that, will that send our teams gps coordinates or will it actually send addressing? It'll send GPS coordinates along with an address in some of our rural areas. Does that tell our teams, I mean, outside of just the driver knowing if there are dirt road issues or pavement workarounds or any. I mean, does our system have the ability to adapt to those kind of inputs? The CAD system does not. The 911 system on the 911 side, once we've experienced an issue, we can update that. As far as saying, hey, go around this way, or if you're going to go to this type of address on this street, you need to take this route. Yeah, but I believe that that all falls within the CaD system. Okay. Yeah, I know it does. Now, I just. I was just curious if this is part of addressing can help us with that. Yeah, my staff handles the street center line files that gets uploaded into the CAD system that they put notes in and can, like, if a road is closed for an extended period of time, it can reroute them. Oh, that's good. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, madam chair. Any other questions? Thank you so much. Have a great day. Yes, and you as well. Thank you. That's going to bring us to Susan Olson, procurement services director. Back on schedule. Back on schedule. How about that? Oh, good. I practiced in my head to talk really, really fast. Well, you're good. Okay. Well, good morning, everyone. We are on page 64 for procurement services. So as you're aware, very well aware, our county's growth has led to a significant increase in workload. And particularly we talked about our procurement contract analysts who do all the solicitations, and we recognize that historically they carried a pretty heavy load. But we started taking positive steps to address the workload without adding new positions. So recently you, the board approved the purchase of some eprocurement software that we have received, and we are actively training and building the software out. It does promise to streamline not only for our staff, but for our vendors. It's going to reduce risk of error, human error. We're very excited about it so far. It seems to be doing everything they promised and more. So thank you so much for your support of that purchase. I really appreciate it. So we do anticipate that we're going to be able to also improve customer service to our departments. They're going to be able to see everything within this software. The vendors are as well. They're going to be able to ask questions in the software and be able to see all the documents they need to see. They can electronically submit their bids to us and it'll electronically tabulate everything for us. So when we have something that has 100 line items and six or seven vendors, that's a lot of lines and a lot of possible human errors. This is going to eliminate all that for us. So thank you again for letting us purchase that and get moving on it. So, you know, we're data driven. So I just wanted to give you guys some highlights of from the last fiscal year. So our team processed about 54,000 transactions. We currently active, we currently administer about 600 active contracts, and we tackled over 200 solicitations and related tasks last year. Most important, we secured about $14 million in savings through the solicitation process and strategic negotiations. So that's with the departments negotiating and procurement negotiating. At times they've done a really good job. So 14 million is a big jump. I think last year we had a $9 million savings that we showed. So part of that is the larger projects that we've been pushing through, though. So I also wanted to touch on vendors. We're actively building relationships with vendors and partner agencies like the CEP to increase awareness and to foster competition. We're also actively reaching out to other procurement, government procurement agencies within our general area and getting with them on setting up that reverse trade show that should be in effect and active next year, probably next summer. So budget, our budget, thankfully, we're not adding any people. Our biggest change in the budget was due to the software that you had already approved. So it did purchase that for us and paid for that first kind of prorated year. And so the rest of that cost, for the annual cost of the softwares in our budget, that's the biggest increase. The majority of the remaining notable increases are for equipment upgrades, like, not really upgrades, but changes. We're doing outdated laptops. We have to replace eight outdated laptops, four monitors and five large capacity scanners for the business services specialists to process those 54,000 transactions. So those",

        "text": " it now um we know at least some fires have been ignited or made worse by electric infrastructure for example the 2018 campfire near paradise california was determined by cal fire investigators have been caused by a fault a faulty transmission line owned by pacific gas and electric company there's been some other incidences of uh electric utility cause or related fire here in oregon although i do want to point out that there haven't been any major fire incidents at fsec jurisdictional um we have had some minor uh incidents reported to us at facilities um and there have been also been some documented cases of fires at um renewable energy facilities so the picture on this slide shows a 2018 fire in gillum county um that was start started after a nacelle caught fire at a turbine tower at a non-fsec jurisdictional facility um there's also been a few incidents of uh fires caused by wildfire or wildlife contact or contact with vegetation at the gentile lines that connect facilities generating facilities to the bulk transmission grid so that's sort of the overall contacts that we're working in there's been this visibility of wildfire and that has led to a increased interest in just making sure that wildfire risk is appropriately analyzed addressed and mitigated during the sighting process and luckily sarah is going to talk a little bit about how we've been doing that so far and what some of the strengths and weaknesses of our current roles are thank you chris so yeah again my name is sarah esterson and i'm just going to walk you through a slide or two so we wanted to highlight existing council standards where there has been or could be an evaluation of fire and or fire risk depending on the facility we've presented those here so first under the organizational expertise standard the council is obligated to find in part that an applicant has demonstrated an ability to design construct and operate the facility in a manner that protects public health and safety and so it's that public health and safety trigger that in some instances we see some discussion of fire risk from an energy and then the second standard that's presented here is the council's public services standard just for reference that standard requires council to find that an build a proposed facility so they can construct and operate it and it would not be likely to result in a significant adverse impact uh to the ability of a public or private service provider to provide fire protection services and then of course that evaluation typically goes out about 10 miles from the site boundary of an energy facility so you can go to the next slide so um consistent with those two standards that we just walked you through we wanted to outline the associated exhibits that are associated with those standards and an exhibit is submitted with an application for site certificate or a request for amendment and in some instances those exhibits have information related to facility fire these exhibits starting in the order we've presented here include exhibit d um exhibit d goes with organizational expertise and then there's exhibit k that goes with land use we'll talk about that in just a second and then exhibit you which goes with public services um so specific examples what we're seeing in exhibit d um is if a proposed facility includes a lithium-ion battery energy storage we're typically seeing acknowledgement of some level of fire risk from dangerous heat evolution or thermal and so a developer might present that to minimize that risk that the transporter of lithium-ion batteries would adhere to federal requirements so there's a little bit of an evaluation and then in exhibit k what we've seen is that if if a proposed facility is located within a local jurisdiction that has adopted code provisions that are specific to fire mitigation or a development standard that's specific to to fire then those code provisions would be evaluated in exhibit k and some examples that we've seen are in josephine county and wasco county where they in fact had some fire related zone provisions that were incorporated and so we saw an analysis there and then um lastly in exhibit u we you know there's an evaluation of of construction and operation of a facility and so we typically see an evaluation of construction-related fire risk and and how that would minimize impact to fire service providers and then for operational fire risk it's really been largely limited to whether the facility is within an existing service provider's territory and if it is then that's largely where the impact is is left and if it's not in a service provider territory then we might see you know some plan for how to work with a service provider a fire protection service provider to ensure that there's coverage in that area but rarely if ever is there any type of wildfire risk assessment under that exhibit for that standard and then we didn't include it here because it's not related to a standard but wanted to acknowledge that exhibit b which is the the project description does have an information requirement to um fire systems and equipment for the for the proposed facility um but a council isn't obligated to make a finding on exhibit b so our intent here is to show you the little um not the little but the places within an application that we have seen some information about fire and fire systems but uh certainly none of these provide a clear nexus to help the department or applicants evaluate you know clearly evaluate fire risk so um i will with that hand it back over thanks sarah yeah and i did um see from jim a comment from jim that these slides are slightly different than uh the ones that were sent out earlier we will get the most recent or this final set posted to the website uh as soon as we after this meeting um you know i think for the most part besides a few adjustments i think this is the only slide that is new from from what was sent out before so um so given that current contacts um we do i just wanted to remind everyone that the council is charged with generally ensuring that the sighting construction and operation of energy facilities is consistent with the protection of public health and safety in the environment and that is under the sighting policy found in ors 469310 and then to carry out this mandate that the council has the authority to adopt standards and rules for the sighting construction and operation of energy as provided in os 469 470 and 469 501. as sarah kind of went over um that ladder statute identifies a number of topics that are currently addressed in council standards um and those include protection of public health and safety and and also impacts on public services and and we think that this rulemaking would fall under maybe either one of those categories um as we are moving into um the rule-making process uh as todd mentioned earlier we are really early in the process and so we haven't settled on a specific approach or strategy um but we have identified some objectives of what we'd like to accomplish with this rulemaking um those that we would like whatever proposed rules we come up with to minimize the risk of a facility subject to the council's jurisdiction uh minimize the risk of that facility causing a wildfire we'd like to ensure that there are adequate protections in place to ensure that public and health health and safety is protected in the event that there's a fire at a facility regardless of the cause of ignition and then finally to provide some regulatory certainty and consistency to our certificate holders we do want to maintain uh with the wildfire mitigation rules adopted by the puc to the extent possible so um at a minimum we are trying to avoid any direct conflicts but really to the extent that we can we would like our rules to follow a similar approach to what they've been doing well well there are several different ways that that can look before i move into our more specific discussion topics to kind of unpack how we want to meet these objectives i just wanted to take a second to see um if anybody has any other any questions or would like any qualifications about the scope or contacts that we're working in right now okay well c none um i'll keep moving on and um as questions or comments pop up to feel free to raise your hand um at any time so um as i mentioned at the beginning we've identified kind of five broad areas where we'd like to get feedback um from you all during our discussion um the first is uh the overall regulatory approach we should take to addressing wildfire risk the second is the applicability and scope of a council standard or rule and specifically we'd kind of like to know what types of facilities the rule should because the council's jurisdiction extends past just electric generation facilities and transmission lines next we'd like to talk a little bit about the specific methods and criteria for analyzing wildfire risk at facility sites and and then talk a little bit more about specific preventative actions or programs that may be uh required or implemented to mitigate risk at energy facilities we're going to go through these one by one i think prepared a brief introduction for each one and then have some questions for you all if we need to skip around a little bit or something comes up that's out of that's okay as well so we can kind of keep the conversation flowing but with that i'll just go ahead and get started on our first topic which is on the regulatory approach okay so um given our objective to maintain consistency with the puc rules as much as possible we uh we would like to get some feedback on what you all think the appropriate approach would be to take regulatory approach would be for the council to take on this um so the puc rules and i will look to uh any pvc staff that wants to correct me if i misstate something but um the puc rules require uh electric owned investor owned utilities to operate in compliance with wildfire protection plans and the requirements for those plans are outlined in the newly established ors 757 963 which was implemented through senate bill 762 the standard embedded in both the puc rules and that statute is that the wildfire protection plans must reflect a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with resulting reduction in wildfire risk um and i kind of wanted to point this out uh because while we are mindful that the the council rule is not intended to uh cause unnecessary cost of compliance or administrator burdens on certificate holders um the council uh really doesn't have the same mandate to uh consider cost containment um or rate recovery as as the duc does so we are working under slightly different and may need to use a slightly different standard to evaluate compliance with a council rule or standard seeing some things moving around um so as we go into this the approach we've kind of recommended is or our initial approach that we're thinking of pursuing right now",

in front of future prod problems yes okay uh there's been a little bit of talk about the street corn lark uh it's down to like they're they're arguing how many birds exactly 900 to 1200 birds and there's eight areas left of critical habitat and this area where their product is and then up around Diamond Hill Road is one of the critical one of the eight critical areas you guys mess around on this bird and you folks out here well so so can can I get you to again talk to the microphone uh aware that spotted out and what it did to that industry yeah well you are about out of the gates of hell fall on your shoulder if this bird is listed and you're about that close people talk about a lot of things but once this thing's listed as endangered I'll tell you what happens they walked out with a map they put a big circle around when they find marks again can they get you oh I'm making the mic Circle folks is pay the taxes that's it you don't do anything else so all you folks need to think really and you folks need to think really hard because this is not up on humbuck Hill and I am going to quote a politician told me one time when we were fighting this he said you loggers don't have enough votes when this bird in this Valley gets twisted it's going to affect everybody from Roseburg to Portland and Beyond and you folks are going to have your hands so full you will you you cannot imagine what's going to happen so you ought to think about this and all you folks out there need to think about this yes thank you very much my name is Dave Rogers I moved to Oregon in mid 70s about the time lcdc was being informed moved from California Northern as they were Building Homes tracked industrial areas and taking up Farmland with these and when I moved to Oregon and I'm a solid conservative but when I moved and when I first came to Oregon the idea of lcdc and taking people's rights away from them and not letting them do what they wanted with their land really offended me for a little while and then it became really clear that if we didn't have something like we would end up just like California with every town attaching to every town and track tones and farmland gone and Orchard's gone um my passion is um wildlife waterfallon conservation this area that you're planning to cover with solar panels is one of the best natural Wetlands seasonal Wetlands that there is and you're gonna you're gonna destroy two and a half miles that we seasonal well it's actually more like four miles stretched out but but two and a half square miles of this of this excellent with nothing to replace it I've built I've built Wetlands all the way from down around Eugene all the way to North of Brownsville we've got a we've got a Flyway of waterfowl that use this in the winter time thousands and thousands and thousands of waterfowl and what this will do if this goes through is to interrupt the section probably at close to four miles long where the where the Wetland the seasonal Wetlands would be gone just think it's really wrong and I think it's this isn't well thought out the idea of the solar complexes you can't call them parks and you can't call them Farms the idea that solar can go onto lcdc land that's exclusive Farm use is just beyond me I've heard all your answers pardon me they're all really reasonable ask anybody in this room you know let's show a hand to people who really want this project to go that's how many I don't have to say another word thank you thank you can I get the show of hands again I know you're next and then you'll be after that sorry and then you'll be after that and then I see you in the back hi my name is David quiero I live in Brownsville Oregon um more question for you you talked about batteries what type of batteries the batteries themselves have not been determined but most likely lithium ion lithium ion do you have an idea of the physical size uh it varies from manufacturer manufacturer but those haven't been picked yet for this project would you guess it's the size of this table or the size of like a shipping container typically they're more around the size of the shipping container do you think it would just be one shipping container or it depends on the size of that particular battery so it could vary do you guys have a fire protocol for if there's a fire with the lithium batteries we would be required to have one but even the uh battery manufacturers typically these systems are self-contained within that storage container looking thing with its own Cooling and fire suppression systems we talked about the whose land it is that you know you're going to be releasing this from the um someone else brought up the fact that a lot of this land is from outside it's in Idaho which parent companies actually in Connecticut which then it ends there um I looked it up on the Linn County assessors and it was sold in 2008 to those companies so kind of interesting just a fact for everybody you know the thing that's really weird about this is that excuse me sorry the thing that's really weird about this is that your company's from California uh or you're based out of California the land that you're going to put this on is owned by a company that's registered in Idaho whose parent company is in Connecticut you're going to capture the soul like so the solar light that's coming to you know the Willamette Valley sell it to us because we need it but the real reason why you're going to do it is because it's you're going to make money otherwise you wouldn't do it um that money is then going to go to the your American company um but then somehow money's going to go to your parent company because you wouldn't exist to your parent company wouldn't own you if you guys didn't give them money so the weird thing about this is it just seems like the all the resources are outside of the state and all the money is leaving the state so I guess my question this would be for you guys is what's the economic impact like um are we expected that prices are going to go down by you know you know 10 or like what's the advantage to us why what's in it for us so to talk about benefits of the project um there's the immediate impact which is the construction phase uh that's anywhere for employing 100 to 300 Personnel for about 18 months um that's directly for uh Contracting and construction of the project That's not including impact it's going to have one the local area including you know these people um most likely to be hired locally but these people still need places to live these people need places for food Etc and things like that so during the construction phase of the project again for about 18 months there's like direct impact to the local economy because there's a lot of resources needed for these people and then after the Project's built yes the construction jobs are gone but that benefit kind of rolls into uh tax benefits so right now when we did our early analysis this project is estimated to be giving Linn County about 1.6 million dollars in additional uh tax revenue every year to be used than you know whatever is needed to support Lynn County and that's very early uh projections um again you know that's not including any of the community benefits packages that we want to propose for the project um been reaching out to different cities to see if there's any pet projects been reaching out to different school districts and see if there's anything we can help with reaching out to the local different groups of interest groups to see if there's anything we can help with and again through all the different schools whether it be from K-12 or higher education things like that I've been trying to reach out to everyone to see if we get a list of things that they would like to see we're never going to say no but you know I can't guarantee anything but what I've been trying to do is just asking everyone like what would you like to see how can we help and I take note of that and I'm trying to see if that can be fit into the project and then the last question is do you think that there would be a significant impact to the price of Consumers power that's not in my control that's that's would be with the utility thank you hi my name is Gary Olson I just got a quick comment or question it was mentioned earlier about the question was the impact of the cloud cover and the ability to produce electricity excuse me I've been recent moved here a few years back from a place called Las Vegas there's a little more sunlight than here if you've gone to Vegas in the last 10 15 years there's On the Border at Prim right inside California there's a solar plant there called ivanpaw it's different than what you have because it's directing up to the peak there one of those caught on fire I don't know if they ever replaced it too they used natural gas to generate electricity there as well which people don't know about but I mean I haven't looked up or studied it recently since moving from there it never met its potential never met its potential they found out weird things planes fly over-haired with contrails reduces the efficiency on their plants more clouds than they expected out in the desert in Nevada but that reduced air efficiency so you got all the sunlight that's there and we have six months so is there a sun and uh I just don't know how this efficiency works on there also when they put that plant in they destroy the desert tortoise habitat prior when you go into California from Nevada on the uh there was a sign there about natural natural area or something how it was worded that signs disappeared and they wiped out all the tortoises that were in there would just stripped in and put their plant so I don't know how we are what we have here if you can just go through uh there is using that as an example that's it just my big boy and my comment and so that's when I can't speak for any standards that Nevada may or may not have but again I'll go back to ours where we have a official Wildlife standard and a threatened endangered species standard so you know that will be evaluated through our process again I can't speak to",

conversation I think he's you know I could use some baseball terms he might have inside baseball on some other leads on this they may be swinging for the fences uh a whole bunch of terminology there but let me go back to KL and have that conversation and I don't is there an is there an urgency to this letter Aaron a lot of the requests and need to be finalized so if there is a legislator who is pushing this forward and putting it in um to be considered they are looking for letters to support as quickly as possible before that revenue forecast because they are in the process of starting to make decisions about what is going to make it into a budget and what is not so probably within the next week they would want to have an answer so we could come back next week and have this further conversation during your leadership communication but we're going to get our own ways and means letter sent off right yeah it will go into the Olex system it is since you have given us the thumbs up we'll make sure it gets signed and delivered Apex we did that already right yeah we did thanks yes yeah yeah you're still on the slide but we already did it does anybody else have any other bills you have questions on or letters we did everything we were hoping to do thank you thanks for hanging in there with us Aaron not a problem the remaining slides are slides that you've seen before but essentially we've discussed the deadline that the policy committees have to have things scheduled for their work session and we will come back to your board um at the leave later this month and then we will try to get through the remainder of session wow so we'll find out about the state's forecast before we have to adopt our own yeah okay the fifty thousand dollar questions all righty thank you all thank holy jamoli it's a hop in session as they all are Catherine okay we're going to turn to a completely different topic how are we doing relative to a where A-Okay right we can just get up and go off on YouTube okay great so we're going to move over to the Beaverton Enterprise Zone reauthorization presentation because we have two folks here who've been very waiting very patiently thank you other active guys you know they don't have much to do anyway so it's kind of kicking around yeah I always like coming West it's just yeah it's such an engrossing discussion yeah I enjoyed it interesting good afternoon chair Harrington uh Board of County Commissioners for the record my name is Matt Curry I'm Washington County's economic development manager uh joining me today is Bill Berg uh the city of beaverton's business development manager and uh today we're going to be talking about reauthorization of beaverton's uh Enterprise Zone uh so Enterprise zones I'll just give a quick intro to bill here and then he has a number of slides and then we can take questions and discussions so uh Enterprise zones are widely used in Oregon as a tool to encourage new investment in select areas in exchange for locating or expanding into Enterprise zones an eligible business receives an exemption on the property taxes normally assessed on new buildings and new equipment the exemption covers a minimum of three years it may extend up to five years land existing buildings and existing equipment continue to be subject to the Beaverton Enterprise Zone was designated in 2012 and expanded in 2013 to include two areas in unincorporated Washington County the current Enterprise Zone expires on June 30th 2023 that's the end of next month as an Oregon statute required step in the process for reauthorization of the existing Enterprise Zone the City of Beaverton needs a resolution from the board of County Commissioners expressing support for the city of beaverton's Enterprise Zone as currently configured this resolution is required because of these two areas that are in unincorporated Washington County no change to the current Enterprise Zone boundary configuration is being proposed should your board support reauthorization staff is prepared to come back to a board meeting on May 16th with a consent agenda items so as you will hear in Bill's presentation the city of beaverton's Enterprise Zone has had a total of six projects in its first 10 years the performance of these Investments has been substantial these six projects have resulted in The Following over 270 new jobs with average wages over fifty five thousand dollars a year over 20 million dollars in total investment and over 8.5 million dollars in assessed value of new improvements in addition to a community service fee to the City of Beaverton that supports job creation and economic development the authorization of the Beaverson Enterprise Zone would support additional economic growth in Washington County and further our partnership with the City of Beaverton so again the policy question for your board today is about whether the board supports reauthorization of the Beaverton Enterprise Zone as currently configured and with that bill I'll turn it to you and again we've made sure that we have some time at the end for discussion great thank you Matt and chair Harrington and Commissioners good to see um Matt pretty much covered a lot of what I've got on the slide so I think we can go through this pretty quick um the goals for today are really to provide you with with kind of a background on our Specific Enterprise Zone in Beaverton there are a number of communities that have them uh in in Washington County well not enough Hillsborough Forest Grove Tigard Lake um we'll talk a little bit about uh how that's performed we'll look at our Enterprise Zone boundaries and uh particularly the two areas excuse me the two small areas of Washington County that are included in that zone um I had a couple slides in there as uh implications for you know what what is the performance of The Zone been in terms of implications for the taxing districts that are having their taxes abated and there's quite a bit of information about that and then the timeline for reauthorization which is most mostly driven by Statute I mean I've been on the on kind of a a train once you get started you have you know X number of days to do this and you can't do this before this work days we're trying to meet all those deadlines so the ask respectfully of the Washington County Board is that on 516 you consider approving a consent resolution which is one of the requirements that I need from you because um you there are a couple of areas of unincorporated Washington County that are included in our Enterprise so that's why I am here the basics Matt covered uh the program has been around as an economic development incentive since 1985 and it is the standard program provides three years of a property tax abatement with an option to extend for two more years beyond that it's important to note that land and existing improvements continue to be taxed at current values so there's no reduction in taxes um there are definitely qualifications and requirements of the businesses that take advantage of this extended incentive uh they must had a minimum increase their full-time employment by 10 and maintain that during the entire exemption period or there's clawback of of those debated taxes uh there are also average wage and benefit requirements for new hires uh the businesses are required to post all of their job openings through WorkSource Oregon they're not required to hire through them but they're required to at least look at the you know post the jobs and go through that process um and then we have some local overlays on top that we're allowed to do one of those is we have a requirement for our procurement plan for the business to make a good faith effort to uh procure its goods and services from Beaverton businesses and they have to report on that every year to us in terms of how that performance is going other than it being smaller than you could probably see exactly but I have them here on my screen okay good so uh the the map on the left is the uh City of Beaverton with our famously weird boundaries uh and then the Enterprise zone is shaded within that and runs roughly you know the West to uh to the South there uh the middle picture is is an expanded view of that what's contained in that Enterprise zone is almost all of our industrial uh light manufacturing office uh zoned properties so uh over the years we've added bits and pieces uh to that so now it's it's fairly full of most of that particular type of land that can be used for the types of businesses that are eligible for Enterprise Zone incentives um the map on the far right is an expanded view of the two areas of Washington County undercorporated Washington County that are somewhat surrounded by Beaverton but are still Washington County namely you know those as Nike and the tektronics campus those are the two areas essentially they were added back in in 2013 so 10 years ago which is before my time so I don't have a lot of anecdotal evidence about why but it makes sense that they're contiguous uh to Beaverton and uh and it can be used to incentivize Redevelopment in those two spaces if they happen Chris did you want to ask questions now or did you wait I just wanted to make sure that in the presentation we were clear on what those two areas are okay that's all our commissioner tries was asking me for the sake of Pokemon and the room commissioner trees was pointing out that this is uh near my home and yes each of these is right across the street from where I live yes and me as well I'm close to these as well oh I didn't know I thought it would be good to give you an idea of how the Beaverton Enterprise student has performed we've read about in the papers as you noted the article recently on data centers and such there are some concerns in various uh areas about some of the performance uh our Enterprise zone is actually done uh pretty well I think in terms of the types of businesses and the return on uh I'll call it Roi return on investment of the abated property taxes but so far",

        "text": " The granting of the change would not adversely affect public interest. It is consistent with the comprehensive plan, and the proposed amendment is compatible with land uses in the surrounding area. Now, if you'd like, I can pause here or I can go on to special use permit. Mister Aleski, would you like to go on and hear both of them at the same time? Yes. And if you would, if you were here for 1.3 or 1.4, you are welcome to leave if you would like. Happy to have you stay with us, but forgot to let you know that you're okay to leave. Make sure you're here on July 16 16th at 02:00 in the room. Okay, so this is going to be 24 0711 Su same owner and applicants. However, this special use permit request is going to apply to both of the parcels outlined here. So that's a total of 0.56 acres. Special use permit request is for a warehouse and community business. B two zoning for use of telecom equipment storage. So assuming that the change in zoning were to go through, this is what the map would then look like. You would have that. B two commercial or community business zoning for both of the parcels involved. Again, no changes to land use. It's still going to be commercial. As far as the findings of facts, most of what is needed is already existing. They have a driveway, but they are looking to redesign. If they do put another building on the property. There is off street parking, garbage pickup, utilities. All of that is available. And existing screening and buffering we will address in a moment within the conditions. They were looking to put a new sign up in the future. Of course, that would be permitted and installed at a later date and go through the building department for permits. And then open space requirements will be addressed at the development review committee. So they will have to meet those minimum requirements. Now, the intent that was provided with a special use permit was to build another warehouse type structure for the use of telecom equipment storage. There would be no point of sale or commerce at this building. It would specifically be for storage. This use is actually already taking place in the existing building that is on the property. So they're just looking to expand, add another building and do the exact same use. They don't have to provide a conceptual plan necessarily, but just in an effort to be transparent. This is what they were looking to do. This is that existing structure. They were proposing another storage building over here to the side. And then again, that was how they were going to kind of rework the ingress egress to provide parking. So these are just a couple more photos. So the existing building has a loading area to the side, which is one of the questions for the findings of facts is where. Where's the off street parking and loading? So they do have that. This is looking towards the vacant area that the proposed building would be on. And then this is just showing the current flow of traffic with ingress egress. And this is the property owner to the south. There is a residence behind it and we would be addressing that with some of the buffering and again, just nearby businesses. And this is just to show you what is in the area. So our subject property is here. These are. There's a number of businesses located within this area. So the request would be similar to uses that are in the area area. So staff was recommending approval with conditions. Of those conditions, we'll just quickly go through them. The three property boundary lines that front on roads will have a 15 foot wide c type buffer, which is standard for land development code. We were asking for the southern property boundary between the proposed use and the residents to the south. We're asking a six foot opaque fence to block that off. If the trick plan would have to be provided to development review committee, it needs to be developed consistent with the proposed conceptual plan. These properties, we are requiring they be combined prior to development. Well, prior to further development, subdividing the property would nullify the special use. It runs with the property, and there's no outside storage permitted. Any kind of storage needs to be taking place within those buildings. So with those conditions, staff was recommending approval, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Can I ask a question? Absolutely. What would be the zoning required without the special use permit? For a warehouse type building? It would be b four. Okay. Mo. So why would they go from b four to b two? Because that was the request from planning. That way their zoning would be compatible with their land use. Community business zoning is the compatible zoning with a commercial land use b four. While there are b four s out there that are developed in commercial. If someone is good looking to develop or redevelop a property that has a commercial land use, we're going to ask them to go b one or b two. That is the compatible zone. Okay. So is the. Is the b four. And I apologize if I don't have this right, but is the b four non conforming to the land use? Technically, yes. Oh, okay. This is another one of those cases where the land use and the zoning don't match, and they're trying to bring them both together. Yeah, I understand. I mean, I. You know, I know that there's a lot of this because of when the plan was done right. It created this. I understand. Anybody else have any questions for staff? Is the applicant present? Don't see the applicant. So we'll move right into. If anyone has any opposition, if you would come forward to the microphone and state your name and address for the record and or any questions, whatever you might have. You guys come. Ladies, come right on up and. And see if we can help you out. This podium right over here. And if you don't mind, while one of you is speaking, the other can write their name and address on the clipboard that's there. And then we can change around and go the other way. Right here on this microphone. I'm Marianne Mills. I own the property. I think south of. What's your address? 12395 Southeast 133rd Terrace. Okay. I know nothing about this, because the people that are asking for this have not talked to anyone. They stay in their building. We understood the business is from Texas. Now, I'm told that these two guys have broken off from the business in Texas, and they're doing whatever here in Ocala. They've been fine. I mean, there's been no problems with them doing their business. It's just when no one speaks to you, it's kind of weird. You know, in Ocklawaha, we do speak to each other. You talk about putting up a buffer for the residents behind. But I'm next to that residence. My property is. Am I not going to be buffered? We'll get that question answered for you. You're on the. But I thought you said you're on the south side. Are you not on the south side? I'm not good behind it. East, west. Everything is south that way. Okay. Yeah, everything will be. Our property is to the west. It's across 133rd Terrace. Okay, so you're across the street. There's a little street there, right? No, I'm on the same side of the street. Right here behind them? Yes. Is that not the side that's getting buffered with the opeg? There's no home on this property directly to the south. I'm sorry? There's no home on the property. Directly to the south, there's a property. The property to the west has a home because there's no home there. You're not considering any buffering for me? Do you live on that property on piece right next to it? No, I own. I live across the street, the two houses across the street. I understand. Okay. So, okay, just. Just to clear this up for you, there's a 15 foot wide vegetative buffer that's going to go in here, here and here. And then there's a fence going on the south side. So there will be buffering the fence that's already there. No, as if there's a fence already there. That's opaque fencing. That would meet the requirement. If not, they would have to place it. It's a chain link. So that would not be an opaque fence. They would have to put one in that you could not see through. Okay, so I won't be able to see the building from this property? From this property. If you can see through the vegetation, you could potentially see it? Yes. What vegetation? What's going to go in? They're going to have to put a vegetative buffer on this side. Okay. Okay. The building will be. What kind of building? As long as that meets Florida building code for a commercial structure. I don't know if it would be block, if it would be a steel building. I'm not sure what kind of building. That's not something they're required to tell us. Can I ask just to clarify something with the current zoning I'm not sure if you understood this conversation. The zoning that it has doesn't meet the land use that it has. So the county's trying to make it comply so it'll be compatible. But if we'll say the m two zoning, what could they put on there? If it stayed m two zoning, what could they. They could put that warehouse on there. Well, with b two zoning, it would be any. I mean, right now, this has b two zoning. With commercial land use, they could develop this right now and not have to request anything.",

        "text": " ability to partner with community organizations non-profits and um it's really just sort of the way i think about it is that the applicant is bottom line in the application but you know there certainly could be particular communities some subgroups within a particular government jurisdiction or um other boundaries whether it could be a consumer utility whatever it is who might uh fit the qualification of qualifying communities so um that's sort of how i how i think about it you know i can and i can envision certainly you know to get into the administrative burden question it was raised earlier you might have a energetic engaged community organization who's willing to really lean in on developing the application and it's the city who kind of um like i said kind of bottom line that application at the end of the day yeah that's some good insight into kind of the formulation of the bill and i mean ultimately these projects have this community benefits component but they also especially with resilience projects they have this need to tie into this sort of critical infrastructure and that might be water waste water or hospitals or a whole host of critical infrastructure that ultimately got you know a lot of overlap with the local jurisdictions the the public entities so from a from a practical standpoint having the applicants be these public entities and in some ways it provides a lot of um benefits to this program and that we know that these partnerships are at least from that side of it are being addressed where those who are in charge of the infrastructure or partners and this question is about how to make sure we get the the other side of that which is the the community members that are drawing those benefits and like adam said you know we basically have these underwriters for the applications that are the public bodies they will be partnering with these smaller community entities within their jurisdictions so all right well maybe we'll move on i know that this is a complex issue and if there's more thoughts as we go we can always come back but i think i'll click through here oh yeah rob i just want to mention that there's a few things in the chat that you may want to um share out oh sure and in fact you know um do you have them on hand ruchi if you want to share them that would be yeah yeah i'll um i'll just mention that there was some discussion about agreeing with orianna's earlier comments around opportunity zones um there was some sharing um from brandy about the about analysis that energy trust has done on dei data baselining and some alignment with census tracts there and then a comment from jenny hall from energy trust on the discussion around not being too prescriptive on what defines an aj community and the metrics being used as being extremely valuable and the thought around an effort to allow maximum flexibility as to whether the program rules could have consideration of creating an initial pre-application or letter of intent kind of like how oem handles hazard mitigation grants and if that would allow the community to describe their project with some simple narrative to identify if their project is viable early before completing a full and brandy responded to that with um some stuff that she's heard about from local and state governments that pre-application concept papers that receive preliminary review on where interested responses are are appreciated um also just to note that orianna had to drop off so that's that's the chat all right thanks for bringing us up to speed on that i lost the thread a little bit on the chat just in the uh being sidetracked on some of the discussion topics so um thanks for that and um it sounds like we're getting some really good content and i'm happy to have those those voices coming through in the chat so i think that we've got this one um well discussed at this point and you know if we if we get to drafting and we get hung up it may be that we are reaching out to folks for some clarification and and working at this kind of development of some of these concepts between our formal meetings i think we already mentioned that but it may be that we find we are going to try to leverage some of your your brain power in between meetings as well so brandi i see you have your hand up thanks rob i don't know if we're going to cover this more in energy resilience but a one thing i don't think we've covered here we're talking about um right the parts of disadvantaged communities ejs is some of it's defined in legislation um but the other factors that one's dooey is looking at is just when you think about air quality so if you've been previously in places where there's more fossil fuel emissions i don't know if that's types of overlays that could maybe when you're looking at certain communities or certain senses track whatever data you have but if you have information around air quality zones um that might be another factor that i think it was alex who commented on having that matrix where again it's not going to weigh an entire application but it's something that just it's a criteria that's weighed into the factor and then i think the legislation allowed for electric vehicles that would just be one other thought is um you know that could also get into air quality and i know with some of the the northeast states they were looking at buses for school children right because all kids stand at the corner and they're all breathing in diesel exhale so um just kind of thinking a little bit about the technology there but there might be some other data sets that could help feed into the community that are impacted in that conversation yeah those are all good points i think that um i think that the air quality piece is that's one of the components within ej screen i believe where you can kind of do an overlay on a map to areas with poor air quality and so maybe maybe within some of the tools that are being used we can get it metrics like that certainly looking at some of the kind of companion technologies to some of these projects like charging stations and evs you can certainly imagine a project that may include solar but may also an electric vehicle that is available to community members as bringing a whole lot of value to some where transportation is an issue and so i think recognizing ej communities have a whole host of challenges that could be addressed by these projects beyond just having a a cash flow created by a project or some benefits in the event of a power outage trying to find those other benefits um is a is a great way to think about these projects so so just doing a time check it looks like we are our public comment period begins at 4 i think we will just reading a couple comments here i think um you know having the opportunity to share comments with um in writing after this meeting is certainly something that everyone is welcome to do and i know we talked about a platform early on but in the short term just having an email thread would be fine so did i get it um i don't know ruchi if you have anything you want to chime in with before we move on to the next group of questions no i think that's great and we'll see how much public comment is um people are sort of asking questions along the way too but want to make sure that if people are tuning in at 4 30 that we set aside some time to pause for that um but we could also use that time if there aren't questions to continue this discussion as well so just putting some thoughts out there in terms of if we um want to continue this conversation in other ways with these uh really good questions and thanks for uh thanks for keeping us on track and i'm gonna i think we've kind of already hit this one are there other grant programs in oregon or in other states um that seek to benefit ej communities that could be used as a model now we've we've tackled some of this i see uh brandy i apologize i'm on the east coast it's later today i just keep forgetting to put my hand down well thanks for sticking with us um this is a late late one for you so um yeah thanks for sticking with us i uh i haven't looked at this stuff in a number of years but um back in the day there was a lot of good federal programming uh you know a federal grant programming um you know for ej purposes that i'm you know that stuff has probably advanced there's sophistication in in working with ej communities and i'm wondering if there's stuff that could be teared down to a state level yeah that's a good point and there's probably others that are a lot more familiar with some of those federal programs and i personally am but anything we can steal or borrow that is useful we definitely would like to do that all right so if there are no additional questions or discussion on our equity questions i think we can move into the energy resilience questions and we we put these questions in kind of the order that we really felt we immediate committee attention for them so if we don't get to our final group of um we put those that were maybe a little more straightforward at the end and so we can certainly invite people to provide by email or some other format if we can work it out but thanks for that really productive discussion on the equity metrics and i think we've got a lot of good content there so changing gears house bill 2021 provides the first program in oregon specifically targeted community energy resilience the bill requires that 50 percent or more of the grants are to be awarded to community energy resilience projects the bill defines these projects as renewable energy systems that support the energy resilience of structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare additionally energy resilience projects are to receive priority scoring under a competitive review process oda will need to evaluate projects to to energy resilience benefits and ultimately to distinguish between projects in the competitive review phase try to advance those projects that have greatest energy resilience benefit so with that preamble first question are there existing designations of structures or facilities essential to public welfare that oto could consider adopting or modifying for purposes of this program for example some existing designations that staff has researched include those identified by fema and oregon office of emergency management all right um yeah it seems like the critical uh critical facilities designation in um hazard mitigation plans um might be a good place to start and i know that's already mentioned a bit i you know we as we were developing our potential microgrid projects and looking at resilience we spent a lot of time looking at those critical facilities and critical infrastructure yeah",

        "text": " pole and then our higher voltage lines would be at the top of the pole and so you there's some good examples of this throughout uec's territory it's been done for other the other option is a 230 kv line connected to the bonneville power administration stanfield substation which is a planned substation or proposed substation at the end of the day there there is a power line that goes through the site today that's 230 kv it's um the lagranta mcnary 230 kv line unfortunately that line is uh almost completely full and so we can't connect to those existing lines a new line is going to be constructed and so we've been having this project studied by bpa similar to the noi we first went back in in 2017 as a wind project we subsequently expanded it to the 600 megawatts and you and bpa has been studying it for the last five years we expect results in july the plan would be to build a a new substation at a 2b determined location at 230 kb and then bonneville would have to separately permit a new line from that substation all the way to mcnairy at 500 kv and so that would be a separate permitting process that bpa would run next slide i think it's some next slide is a map of the two different options so lots of colors and dotted lines here but the the upper left hand corner then call it the northwest part of the site is that 25 mile zigzagging line the reason it zigzags is that's the way the existing uec poles go and then there's a little nub on the top almost in the exact center of the site that is kind of uh our line to connect to the proposed bpa stanfield site and so we have applied for a line that crosses over the umatilla river and um where epa will effectively take ownership at a new substation and go continue to go north with their own line which would extend past the purple area next slide so this is just a you know some of the local benefits of the project we do anticipate entrant into a a sip agreement with the county a lot of information in terms of like full-time jobs this will be a very large construction project and there will be a lot of activity on the site when it is operating typically we have a you know one wind technician for every 10 turbines is kind of the general rule of thumb so the number of full-time employees will depend upon how many turbines we build we do expect kind of our wind staff to also monitor and maintain the the solar facility and and we will rely upon a lot of third-party o m um vendors for um services and support over the course of the 30 to hopefully longer life lifespan and um you know we like to kind of highlight that capital power does work a lot with with local organizations and we do have a a reputation for for you know giving back in the communities that we do operate in here's a picture of a fire station and near one of our wind farms in texas and and we do like to give back to those communities that we become a part of next slide this is a quick summary of all the engagement we've been doing over the course of the last five years um it's all in the application if you want to go into more detail let's go to the next slide and again all the surveys that have been taking place you'll see some of these go back as far as 2010 in terms of the avian surveys as well as the raptor survey so i believe that's it so i will if you want to skip to the next slide i will turn things back over to the hearing officer and happy to field any right thank you um i don't have any questions any questions from council hey kate this is todd cornett for the record um can i add something really i'm gonna take that as a yes so i just want to disclose on the record i think it got missed in one of the slides um between the two slide decks so just to to put it on the public record council members condon and jenkins were on a site visit with staff at the nolan hills site today so i just want to make sure that that was fully disclosed um just in case anybody had any concerns or wanted to raise any concerns about that with that i will end with matt excuse me okay was there someone else who had something they wanted to say no okay thank you mr martin all right i think we're ready to move on to the public comment portion is that correct sorry kate i think we still have uh part of the capital power team wanting to provide some comment that's correct um your honor this is tim mcmahon with stallridge law firm and i here i'm here on behalf of the applicant we also have with us um one of the landowners as a representative who is testifying on behalf of the applicant so i'll hand his card but understand that mr corey will be here speaking next thank you thank you um thank you uh um my name is steve corey my full name is stephen h period or hulk i live here in pendleton i am one of the family owners of the properties that principally are involved in this project and those those companies are cunningham sheep company pendleton ranches and mud springs ranches and i serve as one of the shareholders and as chairman of their boards and so i speak on their behalf and in favor of this project i wanted to tell you and i appreciate the time and i'll do it as quickly as i can but i wanted to tell you a little bit about our ranching and farming and how we operate and how this project will affect us and what we as landowners foresee with respect to it and i have submitted as part of the packet a letter and want to make sure that some points in the letter are at least addressed and then will be available to answer questions if you have questions so i appreciate that opportunity um we farm uh and and ranch uh a larger ranch than 75 000 acres i'm not sure that i haven't gone back to look at it this involves a project you've seen the size of about 43 000 acres where it's proposed we have an integrated farm and ranch we raise cattle we raise sheep we raise timber and we do dry land wheat farming and we have participations for stewardship in our lands in conservation reserve programs and other federal programs that available and of assistance to all the farmers and ranchers i wanted to just speak for a few minutes about different aspects of this project and how it involves us i wanted to address the solar facilities the solar facilities are proposed on 1800 acres slightly more than that of our property i wanted to tell you with respect to that that we view that that as something complementary and supportive of our overall agricultural ranching opportunities and things that we do we think that in terms of of how it is situated that it's situated so that we can utilize all the land around it and participate in our ways with agricultural continuing operations with all the lands around it we intend to continue and intensify our agricultural practices as a result of when we have lease payments coming in we've got many things that we can enhance with our ranch that we have not ultimately over time been able to do my grandparents actually came here in the 19 teens both of them are oklahoma state graduates both of them moved here to oregon and settled here and became ranchers soon after they arrived and this is a ranch that continues now and we actually have i would say i haven't counted but 35 or 40 participants in three different generations that are owners and users and consultants and so on with this ranch my brother was here he just went to a little league game but he's a veterinarian and he provides veterinary assistance to our sheep and our cattle and our horses and i could really go through a long family list of family members that all have roles and participations in this particular ranch we uh i want to just go through a little bit of the letter without uh being too we don't think the project negatively will impact our access to irrigation or water rights this land is not located within an irrigation district and we're unaware of any certificated water rights associated with the land inside the project boundary or land designated for solar facilities there are no wells or ponds on the land designated for solar facilities and we have no intention or need to apply for any water rights in this area at this time or in the foreseeable future that's important to us and i know important to the project in fact the project as i say will enable us to support and improve our farming and ranching operations in the surrounding area by providing payments that we can invest in ongoing activities on a more active basis elsewhere on our property specifically we intend to devote part of the lease revenues to improving improving housing for our sheep herders as well as farm employees that are in the cattle and farming departments we have if you looked at a deferred maintenance and forced a deferred maintenance because ranching and farming is not exactly super profitable in the type that we have this will actually provide we think a big help to our cattle and our sheep operations and our farming operations for our employees we also have been looking at and we'll look at different ways that we can clean up and expand our contiguous related ag in order to strengthen sort of the base one of the things we've looked at is different uh recreational and hunting programs that would be incorporated in that we could continue to utilize in connection with the land and like most farmers we've got lots of needs for repairs of other buildings and and intend to use payments for that purpose as well for us the project will not as we project result in any reduction in the amount of employees that we have to the contrary we actually expect we will add agricultural jobs in one fashion or another because of the different things we'll now be able to do that will support and continue our agricultural venture we also expect to maintain and increase operational spending with local producers with local business peoples grain companies with fertilizer companies with others that are not in our ownership but are around this community it will actually provide more money for us to do things that i'm not sure with the price of fertilizer and diesel today from what's happened",

        "text": " draft that we'd like to put out for written comment and we think it's useful to have a webinar to describe kind of what that is explain ourselves and and ask for feedback so that that's kind of the the webinars are more us reporting back um and also listening but but I think that's the you know the listening sessions are really to listen the webinars are to um give updates and then hear some feedback so if we go to the next slide um I just thought so this one's animated I so I'll start and uh and I'll say next if yeah you can just kind of go through as I'm talking so the first I just want to give a flavor of what the summer is going to look like because there's there's a lot that we have planned for this summer and it's taken us a while to get our uh our consultant on board and now we're like planning to hit the ground running so in July and August if you click next we we we plan to have several public listening sessions we might have some of these more focused meetings and we'll get the working groups kicked off and going um and oo staff will be synthesizing feedback kind of throughout that period and then um by the around the end of August we will um actually have synthesized that feedback and we'll take it back to the working groups so we envision each working group having a meeting where we work through kind of the the analytical perspective of what we've heard from those listening sessions and what we can do in the analysis and then um throughout this whole process the inter agency Steering group and The Advisory Group will keep meeting once a month sorry you have to turn your neck to see that and if you click again um same thing goes for um government toover engagement with tribes we we envision that just continuing throughout and then finally um in when did I say in September we plan to have a webinar where we kind of report back on what we've heard um uh how stakeholder feedback has informed the technical analysis and then kind of September through the end of the year is when the modeling will happen and that you know that's like I think of it as like pushing a big button and then waiting a day to to to see the little piece of paper come out I know that's not how it works but that's how I see it in my head um next slide I'm clearly not a modeler any real modeler was cringing right now um so the just a little bit of a description I'm almost finished but a little bit of a description on The Advisory Group the role as I said is really to provide insights it's to suggest recommendations it's to ask us questions including hard questions um plan to um uh yeah we plan to have these meetings kind of throughout the process for that reason so we're accountable to a a kind of diverse set of of oregonians to kind of where we are in our thinking uh why we're doing things the way that we're doing them and and for us to take on board what we're hearing and and really think about it um we're also oh sorry if you go back I just want to say that we'll ask uh this is part of the pitch right Advisory Group great members will be asked to engage with their networks to help bring robust views to those meetings so that's part of the function that we see of this group um and again we want a really diverse representation um there's no restrictions on who can express interest um and we're asking for expressions of interest between now and June 28th and we envision the first meeting happening on July 23rd so uh if we go to the next slide I think it's just uh wrap up yeah so uh we can share this pres oh we already shared this presentation so uh so you can click on these links and um we encourage you so we post it online so great so the final version of the PowerPoint presentation for anybody who's listening will be posted online on the council's website excellent they can provide all this or find all of this information in the future great thanks and that's that's really everything so um yeah are there any questions on the stakeholder engagement process or on anything that we've presented so far councelor berer just just an observation from living in different parts of the state and working for dlcd and a formal former life um it may not be one strategy because we have these really significant Regional differences and investing the time and effort to be in the communities if you can and that's something that I think um the Odo staff here and being on fset getting out into the communities to listen um and I don't know your budget so I'm not telling you how to spend your money but it will pay off at it will build trust right which is part of getting a strategy adopted um so if you can make it out into some of the farther Realms of Oregon I think it's I think it will end up with a better product and just finally I'm really worried about Transportation but that's just keeps me awake at night so thank you any other comments um secretary cornet yeah just um so when this bill was kind of going through the legislature we gave council members you know updates as to you know what was happening when it was approved so this felt like a good opportunity um to provide you an update as to where it's going we will be asking Edith and Michael back um in the future as well to give an update um at least once if not twice more as to kind of the status I think this this has pretty significant impacts or will have pretty significant impacts on ultimately what projects come to FC so you know this doesn't have direct right now but as a strategy then kind of creates more thoughts on ideas you know and plans and legislation that then will actually have very definitive impacts on on what you all see so there's a lot of relevance here obviously um so I just appreciate the um opportunity for you know you guys to hear this and certainly appreciate the availability of Edith and Michael coming in in person and providing you the updates yeah I was going to say um this Kent and thank you guys guys uh very much um it was very informative we appreciate it and we hope you come back um to give us an update when you feel it's appropriate thank you thanks and and I'll just add uh so folks have an idea because I know I've been focused kind of this summer the strategy is due November of next year and we'll kick off the more detailed policy discussions which I think is where a lot of those Regional conversations will be particularly valuable um early next year I can't say exactly when but kind of I have in mind February time frame I don't know if that's right but um but and I I I very much appreciate the um the uh kind of emphasis on on making sure that we hear from all corners of the yes thank you thank you okay um the next item is uh public comment so uh Nancy um well first of all I'll ask is there anyone well let me read this um this is an information item it's this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment items closed for comment are the wagon trail solar draft proposed order and the Boardman to hway Amendment two draft order we've set u the amount of time for individual commentors at 7 minutes um and I have uh folks here in the audience we've got uh Troy Jones and Irene Gilbert so um Mr Jones would you like to come up it's on oh it's on okay thank you you're good to go thank you chair how council members um it's good to be back again here in Salem be able to see you I've attended the number of uh meetings since January and uh I've been learning a little as we go along it's very informative and thank you for allowing us to have a moment to speak uh I wanted to go through a couple items uh just a review kind of give an update of where we're at and then I have a couple observation we'll try to keep it within that seven minutes so first uh I wanted to notify the council that we have followed your your your thought process and we are pursuing uh change in the uh statute 46954 with the legislative Council we've got a before legislative Council doing a review with them to see how everything aligns so I wanted to thank everyone for that that uh direction that we were provided I also wanted to let you know that we have uh friends of Gap Road has formally organized since uh couple months ago when we were speaking uh we're considered a nonprofit pack at this point in time so I just think I I should go on the record to to that um I also should say I guess this is Troy Jones for the record 22335 Gap Road I apologize for missing that um a couple observations look it's really it to me it's really interesting and it's very clear that this Council understands the tension between land use proper land use and the need for for green energy or clean energy um where're it does not go unnoticed that you all have a strong sense of of the rural heart if you will um of their values and uh the things that I've noticed as we've gone along is is the attention to the potential Wildfire uh noxious weed control athetics all that you're taking into consideration and for that we're very very thankful I think that that's very important um that tension will continue obviously but we but we do recognize uh or at least I recognize that that effort is being applied and it and it it's very important that you can continue to do that so we also see that you don't take these responsibilities lightly and for that I'm very appreciative so that was about all I had for today and I wanted to thank everybody for for the time thank you very much Mr Jones um the second one we have is Irene hi Irene Gilbert 2310 Adams Avenue and I also appreciated the discussion about goal three from the council and your review of that and continued concern with making sure you do that right um one thing uh at the last meeting one of the the uh presentators said when do I get to ask questions of the council and I've been thinking about that and I think I think that's a really important issue because really there is no communication back and forth between council members and the public and I think it's a lost opportunity for the council when that does not occur um one thing I can tell you about my own experience",

        "text": " so these are some h frames this is the existing landscape um and these are these are in uh exhibit r for scenic resources so this is out in front of nahotek and as sarah mentioned i we also have chris um on the line and he's been helping um through the contested case and he's been working on the the scenic resources and protected area sections um and that i do believe that there are were additional vis visual simulations submitted or evaluations or impact assessments um submitted through the contested case in the nahotic area so um and the question comes up only because we're so specific in these conditions correct that i want to make sure that they're the proper conditions and that the design really does fully take into effect visual impacts not that there are no visual impacts the visual impacts aren't significant and here's what's been done to mitigate is it the right condition for mitigation thank you we've had the presentation um from staff and then as well they heard contested case positions and responses scenic resource 3. are we ready to have a straw poll or do we need further discussion on where we're at with this scenic resource three so for the record todd cornette so sure how so council's options are to conduct a straw poll on sr3 right now just that or hold and wait and consolidate and do broader straw poll later on the choice is yours i prefer to do this issue by issue so we don't get let's go hearing no changes uh no alterations i have agree with the findings of fat conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue sr3 okay seeing head nods henley jenkins yes perry choctoot yes ken howe and buyer jordan truitt yes cindy condon yes thank you council members okay the next issue up is uh issue sr7 and the parties here are stop b2h and the issue is whether the methods used to determine the extent of an adverse impact of the proposed facility on on scenic resources protected area and recreation along the oregon trail were flawed and developed without peer review and or public input specifically whether the applicant aired in applying numeric values to the adverse impact and whether the applicant used unsatisfactory measurement locations or observation points in its visual impact assessment so the summary of the hearing officer's opinion on this issue she concluded that the methodology that the applicant used to determine the extent of adverse impact to the proposed facility on scenic resources protected areas and recreation along the trail was reasonable and appropriate limited parties have not shown that the methodology was flawed or that the company erred in applying numeric values to the adverse impact or used unsatisfactory measurement locations or observation points and its visual impact assessment she found that the council's rules do not require that an applicant employ a specific methodology for assessing visual impacts the applicant had no legal obligation to collect constituent to demonstrate compliance with scenic resources protected areas or the recreation standard she noted that the applicant explained its methodology for a session assessing visual impacts in detail in the exhibit r to the complete application specifically attachment r1 that idaho power incorporated measures of the degree to which viewers subjectively value a visual resource that were drawn from the forest service scenery management system and the bureau of land management's visual resource management system but assume that all viewers would be highly sensitive to the resource change rather than collecting specific viewer because idaho power attached the highest viewer sensitivity value to the resources evaluated the data collection on viewers subjective evaluations was not necessary to demonstrate that the standard had been met there's no rule that requires an applicant to have its impact assessment methodologies peer-reviewed or subjected to public input finally the site certificate condition requiring idaho power to underground the transmission line for 1.7 miles in the area of nohotic was not submitted in accordance with the set but even if stop b2h had submitted this in a timely fashion it was neither necessary nor appropriate again based on uh prior council decision in the wheatridge application that uh the council um that would be outside the scope of the council's as as an alternative again that's the summary of the hearing proposed order and so we have both lois berry and stop bth presenting on this so whoever is ready to come on up for oral argument may do so carl anuta appearing for stop and i need to correct mr ratcliffe uh on this one actually miss barry is not presenting on this particular issue she did not accept on this one but i'll be happy to take an additional three minutes if you'd like to present further on the on her behalf let's start with the uh wheat ridge decision issue our position is simple you are not constrained by rebridge because the issue here is not the site boundary it's and a condition on the approval in order to meet your significance criteria you have absolute discretion to impose any conditions that you think are necessary to meet the standards and that includes requiring undergrounding because that is a condition required to reduce this level of impact near the nahotic to less than significant so the wheat ridge decision is a completely separate decision each facility has to be evaluated for its own impacts and its own compliance with the standards and to the extent that idaho power or the department argues wheat ridge is binding on you we fundamentally that might be an example of a place where you didn't require it or it might be an example of a place where the boundary issue was actually in question that's not the case here with regard to the methodology the real issue here is pretty idaho power admits its developed methodology which it's a consultant ms cling developed with the attorneys for idaho power and that was all who was involved in developing it she admits that it doesn't collect feelings of constituents about the our contention is simple you have a significant standard that requires you to evaluate the impact on humans that includes the subjective impacts in addition to the impacts that idaho power did assess which is where are you standing and what can you see from there but if they did not they admit they did not look at subjective impacts they say they assumed everyone had some subjective impacts that doesn't tell you anything about whether those impacts were or were not significant simply saying i'm standing here and i can see x and i assume that i'm a sensitive person does not assess compliance with the standard which is whether that impact is or is not the idaho power methodology that they developed which is unique for this proceeding it never existed before it's pulled together from pieces of the blm and forest service materials did not include key components of those two agency manuals and their processes specifically the subjective feeling components the constituent interviews of how did it affect you um and so the extent that the pico claims that in for example fact 199 that the manuals were incorporated no parts of the manuals were incorporated not all the key component in those holistic programs is missing um final point i would make is as to the idaho powers contention that they did a significance analysis by assuming everybody was sensitive just because you used the word significant and you make your analogy look or analysis look somewhat like the blm or the forest service methodology doesn't mean you actually assessed it the question is for you as a council is did they really actually look at what people would feel when they saw this um i'd go on if you gave me more time but that's probably where i should stop for now thank you mr anuta any questions from council okay thank you thank you for the record this is jocelyn peace for idaho power and i'd like to respond to several of the points that mr anuda had raised first regarding the the wheatridge my understanding is in that case it was not necessarily a site boundary issue either but instead the council appropriately considering that when you're looking at undergrounding it's it's a different facility than what the applicant has proposed and in this case undergrounding would be a different facility with different elements different components than an overhead transmission line we urge the council to follow its prior rationale and decision making in the wheat ridge case and determined that undergrounding is not at issue in this case that the council is here considering facility as idaho power proposed it and its application for site certificate regarding mr nudes comments about idaho not collecting subjective input or not including portions of the forest plans that would relate to the subjective input from constituents i would first note that the f-sec standards don't require the applicant to collect any subjective and moreover the documents that mr anuta is referring is referring to is a 1995 forest service plan that relates to inventory level planning it does not relate to performing an impacts analysis idaho power's expert witness louise kling provided extensive testimony on this subject at the cross-examination hearing so the the documents that mr anuta is referring to are not even relevant to an impacts analysis finally regarding the methodology being sort of a combination of different forest service plans and taking into account the council's definition of significant i would note that in earlier iterations of idaho power's it had focused primarily on the federal planning documents and in response to that initial analysis odo issued an rai to idaho power directing idaho power more closely look at the council's definition of significant and it's based on that guidance from odo that idaho power had worked closely with its to understand the council's definition of significant and to tailor its analysis to meet that definition and i think that is all i will say for that so thank you please uh any be available for questions if there are any any questions from council member condon thank you once again for being to the table uh just a question given that significant which we were shown earlier certainly has that human human peace to it and given that this issue is is of importance to a was it viewed as unnecessary i mean i realize the standard does not does not require it you could step out of the requirements and speak to the community and was there was there just a decision not not to do that i'm just curious what what idaho power endeavored to do with this analysis was to create a methodology that was repeatable and somewhat objective and so for that reason there are process steps that another resources expert could apply and be able to reach a similar conclusion so the effort here was to a method that that could be repeated and that could produce the same results and so as it would relate to subjective input the i i can't speak exactly to what what decision",

        "text": " all right so for the record this is Kathleen Sloan again I just want to thank Jordan at this point for his time and I will turn it over to council if they have any questions while he's still on the phone thank you very much for your presentation uh do we have any questions or comments from Castle chair yes ma'am he says counselor buyer just thank you for the presentation and we'll look forward to some kind of summary from Oda on but they found in the field this year and one third on the transplants and singing were successful so thank you I just wanted to add this is Sarah esterson with Department of energy um that the last three presentations you know are a little bit unique for fset meetings we don't have amendments to mitigation plans all the time you know the kind of represent an issue so ideally they don't need to be amended but um I hope that you can see how complicated it can be the length of time the expertise it's a level of detail that we really shy away from in a draft proposed order presentation or final order presentation because it would make it a four-hour presentation ask that of you um but I think it is it's something maybe we don't get to highlight that frequently uh and the mitigation obligation for an abstract site certificate is you know this times many so know that we're working very hard and rely on our reviewing agencies to help us and um just thank you to Kate and Jordan thank you so much Jordan for being here thank you for your comments well if there are no up secretary Vernon sorry for the record I just want to add on to what Sarah said and just to kind of to me this Bermuda rates the complexity of the elements of our process not because it's our processes because the things that get reviewed and evaluated and identified that either could be impacted or are impacted and how we deal with them so you know I think this is a this presentation you know is a really good indication and I appreciate Jordan being here I appreciate his ability to work on this um you know this makes our process a lot better obviously we don't have the expertise to follow up on a lot of the really complex detailed things that's why our process is built the way it is it's built to rely on our sister agencies it's you know builds relied on local governments travel government it's you know we have a consultant that we can go to it takes a lot it's not just you know we kind of crank through we review it we're done and we move on to the next one this is still a relatively new project but you heard the other ones you know that are 30 years old you know and we we have the monitoring of these things through the life of the facility which I think is incredibly valuable and important but again I think this presentation and the other one show it takes a lot it takes a lot to ensure that these projects are actually you know meeting the conditions of approval um yeah I just again want to kind of make that point or reiterate that point because Sarah did already make that point but just again Express appreciation to Jordan the Oregon Department of Agriculture you know in other agencies who aren't here today only if W you hear a lot about them we work with them considerably you know in other agencies as well I think it's a good opportunity to highlight well so this is chair Grill I would encourage everyone to remember just the detail that we heard when you hear people talk about why isn't it faster I want to take it in a different way this is what we've been charged with to protect the Integrity of our state and all levels there is no hurry up if you hurry up you're going to not get something that we that we as a state have said we wanted so that's where uh calls when Christy referenced earlier um some of the bills that have come out some of the people that want faster better faster this is not that eyeglass commercial that we all watched with the cute little girl right now life-changing permanent decision so thank you uh Kate and Jordan for your efforts we appreciate you being present and I'm sure we will uh hear from you again in the future thank you very much thank you thanks Council yes thank you thanks Council on the final comments of this space team is the milk bench we just had three this species and there's going to be new applied science coming out as some results of this project that's kind of cool yeah and the fact that it's I mean the reason why is you know that it is a stainless it threatened species which means it's an important species to the state of Oregon yeah and so we are utilizing this process our process to better Advance the science you know I totally agree with that and I just want to say being relatively um council member and so much time devoted to um applications and you know proposed orders and post orders and going through that without this contest is difficult I mean it was has been very difficult so these presentations today and Dwayne's compliance you know on the equipment side we're all really providing just to have its foundation and staff has done a really good job of bringing a focus on him with respect to certainly existing projects but it's certainly important um thought about this thank you Mr before we start our next and final agenda item I need to make a statement but I'm going to look at Patrick and say that I'm going to take a statement that I think I remember it has been a long time since boardman's in Hemingway uh so if I need to add anything I'd request that you please advice um due to my former employment this is chair ground due to my former employment with Pacific or um although I have a medical urinary interest in the company I am refusing myself to avoid any perceived conflict of interest um as such we will have Vice chair how facilitate the next agenda item which is the loan defined to a whetstone transmission line um and so I'm going to look back over and if I need to say anything else I'm sorry I did not think about that prior no I think that's sufficient okay thank you so Vice chair bail out a girl I'd appreciate it chair Grail I'm prepared so um yeah the next item is the Lone Pine to Whetstone transmission line appointment of special advisory groups it's an action item and it's being presented by Ms esterson the senior policy advisor picture Sarah thank you very much Vice chair home next time please Wally the Lone Pine to Whetstone transmission line project is a brand new project for the department and Council it's a 230 KB transmission line with two route Alternatives uh ranging from 10 to 12 miles in length it's proposed by Pacific core to be located in the City of Medford and in Jackson County current proposal includes structures up to 105 feet in height on age frames next slide please so just a refresher on why this transmission line requires a site certificate for site certificate review from the energy facility setting Council energy facilities that require Council review on the bonded statute ors-469 300 sub 11 uh transmission lines that call within Council review are those that would be 230 KD or greater in capacity more than 10 miles in length and across at least more than one city or county this project hits all three of those criteria so again requires Council review different slime clean okay here's an overview of the location of the two routes so one route is in the pink the other is in Orange I'm not quite sure if I know which one is the longer one but either way both would be under review and presented in the notice of intent that we received uh at the beginning of March next slide please so we are at the very beginning of the seven phase citing process that the notice of intent phase um just to walk you through what is entailed within the space the applicant or Pacific or in this instance submits their notice of intent uh once we receive feed payment for that notice of intent we initiate a public notice where we send notice to adjacent landowners reviewing agencies and a newspaper of General circulation in the vicinity of the proposed project so a plan to initiate that quite soon and then we would also host a public information meeting uh in the general area of the project and we'll be accepting public comments reviewing agency comments during that time and providing that to the applicant and using that to inform our project order which is the document that sets the regulatory framework for what the preliminary acquisition has to address yes so the record Todd Hornet and just because I made this comment related with the Cascade removal transmission line in terms of number of property owner notifications because in the two routes and it's in an urban area I think we're looking at about 800 property on notifications for this one even though it's relatively small distance in terms of transmission line it still connects to a lot of different you know small Urban properties so we have stocked up on toner on the next slide please as I mentioned we received the notice of intent uh the beginning of March we are waiting to work out a few essential Financial details but we expect that to be wrapped up soon and then we'll initiate the process they just described thanks I believe so one of the key procedural elements that we initiated the notice of intent phase is to request Council appointment of a special Advisory Group special Advisory Group is a term defining statute and it is a designation applied to the governing bodies within the location where the object will be located so in this instance is within the City of Medford and Jackson County the governing bodies there are City of Memphis city council and Jefferson schners those two entities once appointed will play a very important role in this process we will give them a formal letter but do Outreach with them where they identify um requirements from their local zoning ordinance or development code and comprehensive plan that they believe applies to this project they can also provide interpretations uh findings of fact conclusions conditions that they would have applied that same criteria to a similar project and we would assume to use that and understand it so we can be consistent um and then we'll work with them throughout the entire process this is actually I think a lot of our favorite parts of the job to work with counties because they have positions that are the closest to what we do so they actually um generally what we're asking of them because they do it in their own daily life so next slide thanks so as Vice chairman Vice chair Hall mentioned we are here today to request Council appointment of these",

clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations and then the other thing on this slide that you see is what we do that's sort of how we achieve our mission and the five pillars that define our work so several of these pillars i think are involved in the work that you're going to hear about today on floating offshore wind the study is an example of energy data information and analysis and also we hope to be a venue for problem solving oregon's energy challenges with offshore wind looking at how it could be a part of our clean energy so with that thanks again for being here and i will hand it back to richie thanks janine next slide please so we have our agenda today on this slide we're currently in that first bullet on welcome and logistics and in a couple of minutes i'm going to turn it over to brock smith for some opening remarks i'll also cover some brief background on the bill

so far and hear additional feedback from meeting participants there's six topics that are on the agenda today and just as a note there are other topics that will be covered at the next public meeting

opponents of of uh of this offshore wind concept and i can't thank the agency enough for these um public meetings so that we can get the input and get the information out and gather information to bring in was the work of a number of people not just not just me it was it was a number of people in the various shannon souza and others that really helped craft this legislation to really be in front of the opportunities that are coming from the bide administration when it comes to the energy sector and then in addition to as the there's there's other legislation moving forward uh previous legislation with the rps the renewable portfolio standard and the other legislation 2021 or 100 for oregon we were really looking at opportunities and how we can meet these goals in a way that can bring economic development uh to our region while also taking account the you know keeping our ratepayers whole keeping our fishers whole and so forth and so um i just know that there's a number of uh folks that that have uh serious concerns i want you to know that i really truly believe that the call areas are much larger than are necessary for a reason so that we can have a robust conversation and get real good data so that we can have a symbiotic relationship with all of our stakeholders while growing the opportunities that we for the portuguese bay and to the port of brookings harbor as well as um bringing energy resiliency to the coast that does not exist and so i can't thank you enough ruchi and and uh the department of energy and and really look forward to being being a partner in

have a reminder just a couple quick notes on thank you for being here and being present and ready to learn and a reminder to just be respectful to others and sometimes learning happens outside of our

slide please much a little bit more on how to provide feedback today especially for the um participants here we're really welcoming your comments and questions in the chat as well as with the raise hand feature and i'll show you a screenshot next on where to find those note that we have a few guest presenters on the line and we might need to turn to them to share specific information within their expertise and i'll have a list of those organizations in a few minutes as well for the chat we have a number of oregon department of energy staff on the line to help monitor the chat and we're going to be pausing at each topic to take a look at what questions and comments have been raised to discuss them more please use the chat for those comments and questions pertaining to the topic that we're on in the agenda i'll be scrolling through and reading those chat comments and questions out loud we have a few people on the phone so that they can see what that discussion is like as well as

        "text": " and especially in some schools that may this celebration even though they did it last week yes Well I think last week was the day of gratitude and this week is the week of gratitude Ah well well I also want to encourage all the third year seniors who are going to be leaving this this year who finish to thank and recognize the educators who have gotten you to this finish line because I think it means a lot and it would be nice to recognize to those who have encouraged us good perfect thanks to Isaac for what you raise because I want to express gratitude for all the educators in our district and I always think of those educators who had a significant impact on my life I think I can name all the teachers that I have had every teacher since first grade and that I have had a significant relationship with in high school that helped me finish it and I think we can all think of an example at the educators are our cheerleaders our backers sometimes one They don't see something about us and sometimes with a little bit of a push they help us get to where we want and I come from a family of educators I have family in Mexico in family here and also members of the district who are educators and it is a role a very important and has an important weight also as mentioned by director \u00c1vila and I think that there are no words that can express the depth of gratitude that I have for the role of this profession and I think it is important to recognize that it is relevant and necessary as a profession and I believe that we are still throughout the nation Working to be able to Elevate this role and I want you to know that you are valued, thank you Well, I think there is not much more that can be added to see if Excuse me, director Salazar, is muted Well, I just want to echo the words that have already been spoken because teachers and educators are a key element in the lives of individuals and in the future of these people and what they are going to become and I believe that as educators I have been in contact with many children who They were struggling at any particular level and they were able to turn it around. They were able to overcome it thanks to the community members who are outstanding as educators. And these educators come to work tired not only with their own problems with their families but also with some previous problems and I think that This happens in our nation and well, we see them and we see that they can always reach the level that we demand that they reach and that they can really face these situations. And that receives my admiration, I think it is a very well-deserved proclamation. Thank you, director Salazar. I also want to thank the district teachers to all the educators who up with the negative comments as far as public schools rigorous academics hear so many things and I can tell you first hand that every school I went to every educator I spoke to are very focused on the academic performance rigor also socio-emotional well-being and they want The best for the children of Kaiser and It is evident as soon as one enters any school in the district so I am very grateful and tell you that we want to do everything possible to support our educators to continue providing all the resources we have available for you to be successful and know that you are doing the work that helps build the foundation for a strong prosperous economy and a prosperous democracy as well and I want you to know that we would not be the community that we are without our educators and our public schools so with this I want to call for the vote all those who are in favor please say Oh raise your hand two hands for the educators you cannot vote twice Well I think it is a unanimous vote so we have approved the proclamation of the week of gratitude to the very good let's see next we have point eight C Which is also a point on which We have to vote eight c I'm probably not going to pronounce the name correctly we have kurat Ana Ali who present themselves as representatives of zone four of the board of directors of education services district of west we have invited Ana Ali to join us tonight to give a written statement however she had a scheduling problem and could not attend however I wanted to convey the following I am honored serve another term on the educational service district board and I hope to once again have opportunities to collaborate with the Kaiser school board with this then I hear an that we approve Ana Ali as zone four representative on the wesd board of directors Thank you very much, vice president, does anyone support this motion? Principal \u00c1vila does so. Thank you very much. There is some debate around this, directors. Yes, I have a question for the superintendent. I think I know the answer, but I want to clarify, as a District, we do not use the wsd board of directors. It is correct. almost most of what we do is take the money that goes to the lambda SD And that is transferred to us there are some services like special education late childhood early intervention services that we use but the majority of it is taking the money and use it to buy our own things for our own people to also cover expenses for speech therapists etc. Thank you some other debate no So with this those who are in favor please say Oh raise your hand then again we have a unanimous vote we have voted so that miss Ali be representative of zone four this brings us to our consent calendar superintendent Perry wants to review any of the items on the consent calendar just a quick clarification on personal or personnel actions This is the time of year when we see This is starting to get longer because there are people who leave, people who move on to other positions and then we are in the hiring period. This is going to be longer and longer until the month of June and when we start the next school year we are a little bit delayed with the hiring because we are right in the middle of some transfers personnel changes but you will see that this begins to be activated starting next month Well, someone wants to remove a point from the calendar I want to make a comment If I may president in consistent with my previous Policy I know I only have two months left so I wanted to point out that there were approximately 31 resignations this month thank you very good Is there any emotion to approve the consent calendar I present the excitement of us approving the consent calendar Principal Highland has supported that motion So everyone who is in favor please say yes raise your hand there or raise your hand So it is unanimous we have approved the consent calendar well This brings us to number 10 which is readings and discussion we have resolution number two zero two two three script five climate justice resolution this project began in December 2021 with the inspiration that to create change and to raise awareness regarding expanded communication of the effects of climate change on educational opportunities we must create this resolution to help to community members and leaders from different backgrounds and organizations so that These ideas are brought here and can make this resolution possible climate change It will continue to greatly affect us and this resolution is key to allowing and creating spaces for students so that they not only learn about climate change and its effects but also create spaces to generate solutions. This resolution hopes to raise this issue so that students can adequately learn about climate change in the classroom and also create school communities to prioritize sustainability and climate action for what educational opportunities related to climate justice have been offered to everyone we are going to do a first reading tonight I am not going to read out the entire resolution but we hope that this will be approved at our June meeting it is where we are going to present it for your vote and if we pass this resolution we can be a catalyst for other districts in Oregon to follow our example and pass these types of resolutions all students deserve the right to know what is happening in their houses and also to have the space to generate solutions How this is a first reading we remain open to your contributions and comments to want the directory presented feedback and some ideas by email today I hope that our student advisors also get feedback from the student groups that exist in our schools and that we can adjust some issues to present it for voting in June with this then I open the space for debate Director Highland Sorry I have some comments to make and I hope that we can have adequate logical debates on this I will read what I wrote earlier Today you know that I love the world we live in and that I do my best to be responsible regarding resources including recycling, reusing and but unfortunately we are being pushed in the direction of an Environmental Justice movement we are not ready to maintain it There are people who or we are telling people not to charge their electric vehicles and that has to be a big alert We do not have the Anyway to address this by mandating or ordering changes that we cannot sustain what happens with the wind turbines What happens when they travel there under the This causes transportation to kill birds every year 2 mega watt wind turbines that 1600 tons they use 1300 tons of cement 295 of steel 45 of iron 24 of fiberglass and copper four tons of neodm and many things that have to be mined and these wind turbines are not recyclable that is why they end up in landfills the solar panels are the ones that I have in my house and that is how you have had here Ana was a hotel I love solar panels but what are the chemicals involved What are the risks that affect the people who manufacture it, in my understanding all of this is going to have to accompany the wind turbines in the landfills when their useful life ends and finally the lithium batteries are wonderful, they are what allow us to charge time and again our cell phones without having to overheat also allow us to have electric vehicles electric buses there is an important part of these rechargeable materials called cobalt and it takes a thousand times more cobalt to charge an electric vehicle battery than for the cell phone and how much more for the bus I don't know where most of the cobalt comes from probably from the Congo where women children have to work for a dollar a day they also work affected",

        "text": "um thank you for your patience we have re-established connection uh with the WebEx the time is now 903 and we are ready to resume the meeting uh so I believe where we left off um we have now been able to review uh the form that was referenced it has been emailed uh and we were looking at um well I was asking does anyone have comments I think Todd was going to say maybe uh something before then but the question what for Council is does anyone have any comments around Council Members suggestion from wood to Will and then Vice chair how have something I agree with their comments and um that it should be will instead of wood so I'm there thank you anyone else I see some head shaking and so I'm just looking over at uh counselor if there's anything he would like to comment yeah I would just add that assuming that Council approves that change it would be subject as as uh any site certificate if something changed in the uh corporate structure or in the uh then they would need to come in for an amendment anyhow and so changing from wood to will wouldn't change that uh they would still if if for some reason Capital power was no longer the consider the parent company they would need to come into Council inform you of that uh and potentially need to get an amendment to the site certificate that that is true regardless of whether it's you use the word would or will okay thank um council member Condon does that alter your opinion at all in making that no confirms it okay councilmember buyer um I think this is the first time we've seen this kind of letter and guarantee and I think it's something we may want to consider in future site certificates to address some of the concerns we've had about the relationship between parent companies and subsidiary and and while I'm doing this I just want to thank everybody who's spending part of their day with us we know these processes are long and complicated but we appreciate your taking the time to participate it's really important for council members to get your feedback and to see your interest in these big projects so thank you thank you for your comments and I'm remiss I would like to announce that we do have the Commissioners I don't know if it's all of you but I believe so uh the three Commissioners from Umatilla County present so uh having you here in your own area to represent the um the county we appreciate you being here thank you um okay so we have I think agreed that wood uh to will would be preferred for uh us as Council and so Kate you can um so now that the next issue I guess is with that change are we as Council fine with what has been presented or if there's anything else council member Condon thank you again um just a quick question with respect to the guarantee we just um received is that attachment f with the Department's legal with after consultation councilmember buyer asked the same question we're on break so attachment f is the form that we've already approved if they use that form they're good to go if they would like to make changes to that form then we would need I along with the Department would review that and need to approve it thank you thank you Vice chair health yeah I agree with the findings of fact conclusions of Law and conditions of approval in the proposed order thank you Condon I do as well secretary Cornett sorry to interject um so I'll kind of go back to it doesn't have to be as formal as like the the um so I don't know if we technically even need a you know a motion second um so my plan was to Simply you know read what I believed your your direction is and then I'll call roll if that works for everybody okay thank you okay so um what I have based upon the conversation was agree with the proposed order findings of fact conclusions of Law and conditions of approval with the following changes so on the slide there was the bullet um and I'll read the language uh Capital power Corporation as the parent company to the LLC is the entity that and would strike wood and add will fund the construction operation and retirement of the proposed facility I see head snotting so we'll say yes so that would be the sole change on the organizational expertise findings facts and conclusions of law conditions of approval okay Ken how yes and buyer Richard Devlin yes Jordan Truitt Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes okay that doesn't pass that's just a straw poll so again this would then be carried forward into the final order well thank you Council for the record this is Kathleen Sloan again at this point in my presentation I'm going to stop and I'm going to turn it over to Assistant Attorney General Aaliyah miles and she's going to present to you on the proposed contested case order and the proposed oh and then the exceptions hearing and then I'm going to come back for item 1B so thank you for your time okay good morning uh chair Grail members of the council for the record um I'm Aaliyah miles from the Oregon Department of Justice and my role today is to advise the in legal matters related to this portion of the Nolan Hills project contested case hearing and then the exceptions in particular filed by the county uh Patrick Rowe my colleague at doj has been representing the Oregon Department of energy in this contested case and um for some years and and you're probably aware of this it has been the department and the council's practice to have separate Council represent the department and the council wants an application has proceeded to a contested so that is the case here that is why you see me a new face instead of Patrick sitting in this chair um this uh separation is not required by Statute it has just been a practice and my role is basically just to be a resource to you to the council to answer questions that may arise as you hear from the parties um I'll sort of kick things off by um the contested case and what the hearings officer decided here um before we hear oral testimony on the exceptions that were filed uh and any Odo staff walked us through how we got to this point on this application for a site certificate and before I turn to the contested case in this matter I did want to review just a couple other preliminary items one is that you know ordinarily when someone asks their attorney for advice that is confidential attorney client privileged as you know from other processes the council's practice has has been to at times and this is the council's choice waive that privilege and seek advice from the person sitting in the chair I'm sitting in I'm in this public setting that is always council's choice and so if you at any point any of you wish to have a privileged conversation you can indicate that somehow but I did just want to flag that um so we'll spend about 15 minutes reviewing the contested case phase of this project application um and then I think our schedule has a short break before we proceed with the exceptions hearing I guess the only other preliminary thing I wanted to say is to please stop me at any time with questions as I'm reviewing the contested case hearing portion and and I would also ask that Odo staff and feel free to stop and uh you know correct me should that be necessary I have come up to speed um on this project but I know there's no replacement for living with something over time and so in the event that I missed it or say something confusing please feel free to chime in um okay so I think with that go to the next slide please okay so just for this uh preliminary portion of the uh what I'll be presenting on is just reviewing the contested case proceeding that has occurred who the parties are the issues and the uh order from the hearings okay next slide uh as this slide shows um the the big milestones in the contested case um are are listed here it was in August 2022 there was a note the the department issued a notice of proposed order and opportunity to request a contested case you just heard about all the other portions of that proposed order that you know all the other standards um with regard to the land use standard um the Umatilla County petitioned for a contested case um the hearings officer was assigned and the dates to the right show that August to April of this year that contested case proceeding has been um the proposed contested case order was issued in May of this year Umatilla County has filed exceptions to that proposed contested case order the applicant and Department have and so today is your opportunity the to hear from parties in a way that supplements the written materials that that you've had that you um received a couple of weeks ago and you know consider the issues that have been raised okay next slide um so as mentioned there's Umatilla County is the party that requested uh party status limited party status for this contested case the department of energy as you know the staff to you who recommended the proposed order has also responded and the applicant as well um the issues that Umatilla County articulated as the basis for joining as um as a a limited party in a contested are placed up there you know we're going to see it presented in different ways during the exceptions hearings but for the purposes of the initial request for a contested case Umatilla County asked to raise the issues that you see there number one that the counties acknowledge land use and what I'm going to refer to as Criterion three so that you don't have to hear me read that entire rule ordinance name um land use regulations in Criterion three requiring a two mile setback between wind turbines and Rural residences on efu Zone land our applicable substantive criteria within the meaning of the council's rule that apply to the project and that the project does not comply with Criterion three so that was issue one and number two that the project is required to obtain a conditional use permit from an I think we dig into those a little bit more on the next slide so let's go to the next one so the the way the issues were framed for the contested case are here you can see issue one again is really stated in its most simple terms it's whether the County's land use regulation that I'm referring to is Criterion three um is uh an applicable substantive criteria within the meaning of F sex statutes and rules that apply to the um issue 1.1 is a is a sub issue because you only reach it you know the hearings officer only needed to reach it if the conclusion to one was",

        "text": " where we get into some of the things that we've seen occur in similar areas. Where there's had to be incentivization or payments associated with future connections. Thank you, Mister Roberts. Any other questions for him? If not, I'd like to open it up to the public. If there is anyone in the public. Who would like to address this issue, I'll invite you to come forward. If not, I will bring it back to the board for discussion. I'd like to hear from Mister Titterington. Regarding Bellevue and their incentives that they've offered to this developer. Thank you, Mister Titterington. Thank you for being with us this afternoon. Yes, I'm happy to be here. Bob Titterington, city of Bellevue Public works director. 5525 southeast 19th Street, Bellevue 34420. Yes. When this project came in, we had reviewed the plans. We do not have water on that side of baseline. And they do have to drill underneath the pavement. I had made a request to our board that in some cases, to get water on the other side. That we would potentially would participate in some impact fee credits for the water line. On the transmission side only. It doesn't offset the total cost that they're talking about. But every little bit helps. What would that cost be? It's only about 3000, $504,000. It's very little. Are there any other incentives that you have discussed with them or that was the incentive? No, that was the incentive. There's quite a few lots out there that you'd benefit from if this were to go under the road and get over to that side. I mean, there's quite a few that have not been developed yet that could be very beneficial to your utilities. Has the commission not looked at that? We are currently, all of our funds are now being allocated waste water and wastewater, building a new water plant. We're doing expansion on the wastewater plant and we're also designing another expansion on the plant. So basically, most all of our fees are allocated to those projects. We don't have any waterline, sewer line extensions, only what is developer driven. And typically the developer pays for most all of that. We may give credits just in this case because the money comes out of the funds that they would be paying to city. Thank you, Mister Tetherington. Yes, maybe I missed it. What is the total cost of this connection? $176,000. Am I right? 276, not including site work associated with the actual connection. So that's not earthwork, that's just drilling, pipe, lift station, etcetera. And the connection. So understanding, back to the point, did the developer consider this and say, absolutely. And proceed under the understanding that he was to do it? Absolutely. I just think the cost wasn't really contemplated. It's only 476ft with some additional variables. Thank you. Go ahead. You said when the ability to hook up was there that they would do that? Yes, sir. Jody, do you know an estimate of. I know Bellevue's involved. It is the city of Bellevue service area. So we, as far as the county, we have no schedule of placing anything there. It would be on them to do that. I will say also that this is not different than anywhere else in the county within that 400 foot range that we require folks to extend. I keep hearing directional bore versus Jack and bore. I've not seen the prices from what was developed here. I think they're extremely high. We're doing this type of work throughout the county and again, I think they're high, but that's my opinion, humble as it may be. But I just want to kind of put that out there. I mean, we still place services up and down baseline. If somebody needs a service, we're bore across the street. Absorb that in the service fee. So just kind of put that out there too, to think about. Commissioner Curry, and hold just 1 second. Would this be an enhanced septic system? That you're talking about. Yes, sir. It would be required absolutely unequivocally. And just to Mister Kirkman's point regarding the cost. I certainly. I defer to mister Kirkman's expertise, and Miles Anderson is a project engineer on this. I'd let those two discuss what's the appropriate cost. But I will say that the estimates were received from Miller pipeline, Salzer Construction, and Marion Rock. All very reputable. The cost estimates were 276,300. Should be 261,000 plus site work, 331,000 plus earthwork, and 444,000. Those are the three estimates from what I believed to be three very reputable firms, if not the most reputable firms in our community, who deal in these particular things. So, understanding Mister Kirkman's point, but I think these are three real estimates obtained by the engineer provided to us written. We certainly can provide copies right now and today if that would be beneficial. Just one more comment. That is, you were born here. So was I. Absolutely. If you go out to Silver Springs right now, it's a mess. And every time we allow a septic tank, it gets worse. Nitrogens, phosphorus are pouring in to Silver Springs. And so somewhere, sometime, we've got to put our foot down and save our natural resources, or they're going to be gone completely. You know, that's why we're spending all this, like 20, $30 million or more out in the springs area to try to convert from septic to sewer. And we've got a massive effort to do that. And then here we turn around, and that's the conundrum I'm in, is trying to protect our resources and not violate our own rules and regulations. I understand the conundrum. Obviously, as you know, this is something that is near and dear to my heart from my time on the water management board, really championing some of the grant programs through DEP for connection and to really incentivize people to individually connect within these principal spring protection areas. I will say this, it's an excellent point, and really now becomes an academic one. And I'll make this very brief, is that at what point do we put the burden on the individual property owner for the sins of our fathers, because nobody else connected in the past or versus. At what point do we have to look at as a kind of concerted effort to the utility providers that are going to receive the benefit of this over the long term, is the ones providing the lion's share of the capital costs associated with running these lines and then requiring connections at those times. In this case, my opinion is it is very likely, if not a certainty, that this site is going to have a well and septic, because that's what our rules establish. 400ft is the minimum. If you considered as one ERC which would be developed, they're going to put a Welland septic in because $276,000 on a $500,000 project, it just doesn't work. The math doesn't work. Math problem doesn't work. So they build a $200,000 project, put a Welland septic in and sell it. Where is the tangible benefit to the. To the county, to the resource? Right there. In that respect, I would say there's a very negligible benefit associated with any flowage versus no flowage. The delta is whether it's three ercs or one. It's a very, very small delta. But I do agree with you that I think it should be a priority. It is a priority for installing these improvements so that when these next level developments come online, they will be required to connect at a cost that does nothing, totally dissuade the use of these lots, so we can look at infill development, not next level. So that's very academic. I understand where you're coming from, commissioner. Correct. In fact, I completely agree. And that's why the voluntary requirement to connect when it's available is so important. Because without that, we're just kicking the can and we're not kicking the can. We're never. We're just ignoring the can. We do want to kick the can. We're asking for a waiver. We're here before the board to ask for that waiver. That is certainly to be considered for that purpose. But 100% keeping the can in the county's hands so that we ensure that the impact is reduced to zero once it's financially available. So I apologize. Thank you so much. I would like to at least remind the board, I keep hearing about the crossing. The crossing, that's water only. Sewer is on that side of the road. There's no crossing involved with that. Just wanted to remind the board of that. So if consideration is given there that at least going with this higher density on this smaller lot, at least we could take care of what we need to take care of with regards to the springs and chairman. So just to the sewer side, a fair point by Mister Kirkman. This is a force main currently installed on baseline. It's not gravity. It requires a lift station to service the entire distance. And one property owner then is burdened by a lift station that would be more significant. So I don't know how to reconcile those two things, but the cost of a lift station is going to be very significant. There's not a way in which, for example, you see the term grinder pump or smaller pumps. This is a more significant lift station. So that is incorrect. It is a grinder. It is a dual pump grinder system. It is not one of our typical lift stations. And I'm sure the city of Bellevue would agree with that. This is not a typical lift station. It'd be on the grinder side. I'll defer to the engineers, except for we can give you the quotes is all I",

time and date set for a public rulemaking hearing the purpose is to take public comments on proposed permanent rules which would establish a program energy efficient rebuilding of eligible structures destroyed during the 2020 labor day for wildfires the filing caption for this rulemaking is establishing wildfire recovery energy efficiency incentive program and providing procedures for program the rules were drafted to meet the program's objectives and the proposed rule numbers are three three zero two six zero zero zero one zero two three three zero two six zero zero one one zero i'm gonna go through a brief summary of the proposed rules um oregon house bill from the 2021 legislative session established a program for incentivizing energy efficient rebuilding following the 2020 labor day wildfires these rules provide the procedures necessary to implement the program the rules outline requirements applicants and structures must meet in order to be eligible for the incentive program including that the owner must be altering restoring or replacing a structure in oregon determined as having been damaged or destroyed by wildfire between august 1st and september 30th 2020 other requirements include the need for an approved building permit and requirements set out in house bill 22 89 section 23 incentives are outlined for detached one and two family dwellings and townhouses at two different levels asset and uh or above current building code additional incentives are available for applicants who meet low income this slide shows the totals that are available for the different levels an incentive for commercial buildings public buildings and multi-family housing structures or facilities is outlined in the rules an additional incentive is available for multi-family housing providing housing to low-income households also established as an incentive to owners of manufactured homes that were destroyed or damaged in the 2020 to incentivize the purchase of a new energy efficient manufactured home or the installation of a heat pump system how applicants can qualify for the different incentives and tiers are detailed in the rules a homeowner can demonstrate they qualify for a higher incentive as a low income homeowner if they're eligible or have been eligible within a set time for the following oregon housing community services department programs the low-income home energy assistance program oregon energy assistance program or the low-income weatherization assistance program or the following oregon dhs or oha oregon health plan and the children's health insurance the rules set out requirements for hvac contractor participation how all the incentives will be applied for the incentive reservation process and the completion and verification steps required the final part of the rules focuses on the compliance responsibilities of the applicant and the department's procedures regarding compliance with the rules the oregon department of energy appreciates the information and feedback that stakeholders have provided through the rulemaking process notice for today's hearing was filed with the oregon secretary of state on november 24 2021 and published in the december 2021 oregon bulletin this hearing will be conducted according to the oregon administrative procedures act ors chapter 183 and the attorney general's model rules in addition to the opportunity to present oral comments at this hearing anyone may submit written comments in the rulemaking comment portal on the oregon department of energy website or by email at

considered by the department unless the department decides to extend the public home period for everyone after the close of the common period the oregon department of energy will review issues raised during the public comment period and prepare a hearing officer's report the oregon department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding these rules this slide lists some of the errors the

going to provide testimony i'll call upon you you can let me know at that point apologies if i pronounce anybody's names so we'll start with john schmidle from santiam hospital john schmiegel you're available you've been unmuted did you want to provide testimony john you just didn't say when you introduced i will uh move on to the next person john if okay got your chat comment now thanks if you want to submit any written comments you're welcome to do so as well so we'll move on to the next person wishing to provide testimony it looks like we go down to alessandra de la torre from row climber whenever you're ready hi can you hear me yes oh okay great i was having a little issue with the unmuting um but thank you thank you uh for having this um i had some comments and then also some questions um so i'm alessandra de la torre i worked with rogue climate um down here in southern oregon and um i was for the equity and access one of the things i wanted to comment on was if it was possible for prioritizing applications from low-income owners instead of having a just first-come first-served basis if there is a way to have a process so that low income owners could have priority in their applications for the funds that are available i also was thinking for accessibility if the department of energy could provide examples of documents needed for eligibility simple like images that just show kind of how the documents could look and that way people have a reference for the documents that are going to be needed whether that's um through like on the website having those examples up um just so that people could be more assured of what documents they'll be needing and how they could look um and i'm also uh for the language in the draft rule making if if y'all could add um retroactive language in that i did see it in the home section that it's explicit that it is retroactive but wherever else it applies if it could be explicit um that it is a retroactive and other than that",

        "text": " DSL permit and finally number five the hearings officer concluded that of the seven criteria were satisfied only because they could be made a condition of approval so in each of those instances by saying that the Criterion could be made a condition of approval the hearings officer is saying that the condition was not met if the condition was met you wouldn't have to defer to later Maring county code 17178 060 subj is the no rise standard it says among other things that improvements shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community you may recall that the friend's uh proposal to satisfy this standard is to essentially dig two large holes and remove two uh 40 cubic yards of river bank to compensate for the installation of pilings the problem is that the friends doesn't have permission from DSL to actually remove this rer Bank from the river I'll point you to the DSL application and permit which is attached to as exhibit 16 to the tto Declaration the first declaration without obtaining approval state law prohibits any removal from Waters designated essential salmonid habitat which includes the wamit river again we've cited to the applicable Provisions in our written because the friend's proposal to satisfy this Criterion is unauthorized by DSL it cannot support a conclusion that this Criterion is met I'll now move on to the next major topic which is the wamit river Greenway criteria for the sake of everybody's time and Sanity I will just refer you to our written submission which outlines the policies for the greenway which are described in detail in Maring County's comprehensive land use plan but what they essentially say is that private access to the river um most of the land along the river should remain in private ownership and public access points should basically be made available in urban areas and public parks so the criteria we are are very important important to evaluating the flood uh The Greenway criteria in 17179 I'm now going to talk about each not each of the criteria just a few of the greenway criteria that you need to consider Maring County Code 17 17950 says that significant fish and wildlife habitats shall be protected as we just discussed the wamic river is considered an essential saled habitat and Oregon law prevents the friends from removing any amount of soil from the wamit r River without approval the friends does not have that approval the sole document that the friends relies on to say that this Criterion is met is an email from Noah Fisheries we explain in our appeal that this email is ambiguous we also don't know what plans were presented to Noah certain certainly if Noah had known that the friends did not have authority from DSL to remove the soil from the wamit river it could not have given its blessing for this project we also explained in our appeal that Oregon Department fish and wildlife have its own guidelines for docks in the wamit river which is designed to minimize impacts to Fish Wildlife and resources the friend's proposal does not appear to or does not satisfy these guidelines so under the circumstances the friends has failed to satisfy this Criterion I'm going to combine two of the criteria here um subsection C and subsection d g of 05 because they concern the natural preserving the natural state of the land maintaining the scenic quality and protecting Wildlife so they kind of go together the hearings officer said that these this was met because because the gang way and Dock and its related structures provide a means for the public to access and experience the river but that has nothing to do with the stated Criterion as to the actual Criterion the friends has already destroyed much of the natural and scenic areas when it performed its unpermitted restoration work beginning in 2017 on the left of this slide is a picture of the property before the friends development and on the right is a picture taken after the friends began cutting down all the trees on the property the record is replete with evidence that these criterian are not criteria are not satisfied and the friends failed to prove otherwise Maring county code 17179 50d says among other things that areas of archaeological significance shall be protected preserved restored and enhanced to the maximum extent possible the friends has said that this Criterion is s uh satisfied because a cultural survey has been conducted we actually asked the state historic preservation office for a copy of the cultural survey that the friends relies on its response there is none instead shipo said the only document shipo has concerning this property can't be released because it would reveal the location of protected Arc ological resources so the friend statement that shipo has performed a cultural survey is unsupported by any evidence and is contrary to shippo's representations when we asked for that survey we' included the full email exchange with shipo in our latest submission I believe it's exhibit 46 so under the circumstances the friends has not met its burden to show compliance with the stated Criterion subsection I says the proposed development change or intensification of use must be compatible with existing uses on the site in the surrounding area again the starting point for this analysis is not the present application because the project must be considered as a unified project with the development beginning in 2017 there can be no reasonable dispute that the very purpose of this project is to increase public use of the property and attract new recreational users to this to the property relatedly it's important to consider zoning of the area when determining whether the project will be compatible with existing uses the entire Beville Community is zoned acreage residential including the disputed property the sole exception is the bville general store which is zoned Community commercial under Maring county code Parks may only be uh permitted in acreage residential zoning if they are operated by governmental entities and Maring county has already disclaimed responsibility for maintaining or operating this site cuz it's not a park that's not the application I mean I appreciate what you you keep intending to do here but the fact is is that it's not an application for a park whether I agree with any of this or not I would really appreciate it if you'd stop implying that it's an application for a park I appreciate that I appreciate that commissioner bethl I will just point you to all of the quotes in our appeal that say both from Maring County and the friends that it is a park and I will we can agree to disagree on that great you Maring county code 17179 50 LM and O again I've combined um for the sake of efficiency because they all concern substantial interference with established use on the adjoining property maintaining Public Safety and protection of private property especially from vandalism and trespass and considering Public Access in light of the of the surrounding area again this is a quiet rural community and what the friends has done is draw people to an area which advertises itself is being open 24/7 to do whatever they want whenever they want the evidence we've submitted in the record including the videos will show you several things one is that parking is a major issue on the disputed PE property especially for my clients because people are constantly parking in our clients driveways or blocking the driveways complete Council yes that's not an issue here please stay to state to the the two issues that this is a flood Clan criteria and it the question parking parking parking is not it flood okay this second issue is that my clients have had no choice but to result to self-help to address the late night visitors to the property that means that my clients are going out in the middle of the night to confront people who are partying on the property and requesting that they leave the friends had previously claimed and the staff report accepted as fact that the Maring County Sheriff regularly patrols the area we requested the sheriff patrols of the area and we submitted that to you in connection with our submissions and that demonstrated that in the span of 13 months Maron County patrolled the area only six times the only other times they came out were this is not an issue I apologize it's not an issue I understand that we have people all throughout the county that don't get patrols like they would like to but that's not the issue that we're here to talk about today the I'm sorry the Criterion is Public Safety that's the stated Criterion finally as my clients will tell you shortly they have suffered from trespass and theft as a result of the development date people are often using my client's property to access the river as you can see from the photo above there's nothing physically preventing the property uh the public from accessing Miss Kramer's property this is her property here if you walk out to the site right here you'll see a path that the public have actually worn to access the wamit river the public are also using my docks to swim because of the Public's use of my clients or entry onto my client's property my clients have had many things stolen from their properties and we fully expect that these issues will be exacerbated by the friend's propos proposal because the development seeks to increase the number of visitors to the property by river car and foot so none of these criteria have been met either I'm now going to pass it the microphone over to Bob thank you Commissioners um I do appreciate your uh time this morning this is a very important issue to my clients and I hope that you understand that um that this um project already has had a very significant impact on them uh and they're very concerned about how that will just be intensified as a result of the um project that is um I I'm reading the room so I'm going to be um very brief um I just wanted to hearken back to uh last year maybe just just uh introduce yourself for the record again because it's been a long time I'm B aringer uh herong PC I represent uh the appellants in this case thank you commissioner Cameron um last year uh staff asked you to amend the county code in order to allow uh persons to submit applications for cont conditional use permits uh in a way that would allow the friends of historic Beville to um uh submit this sort of application for development on land that it does not own and against the will of the actual owners of the property we submitted uh written correspondence on that uh Miss Kramer came and testified to you about that and the concern we raised with you was that uh in making this revision it was uh it was creating a serious impairment of private property rights uh for the individuals who actually own the property and would be affected by it",

        "text": " the applicant to think about it as well so not that you have to make that during your comment here but if you're thinking about you know providing written comment that was exactly the kind of comments that we're looking for okay so I'm going to say Tony yeah thank you and then next will be uh Lois Hawk I live out on Gap um a ranch is about 800 acres and I've been in our family since 1860. I have mostly comments not questions uh to me this is a land use issue and it's in and it's not a state thing and I kind of kick on with the guy previously but I'm pretty sure the Linn County Commissioners are not for this and they weren't to begin um just in some conversations I have and it appears that going through this process is like making an end run trying to get past it find the easy way uh I believe in elected officials that I have some input on and certainly not appointed officials that I have no input I don't know what the law was or the I'm going to call it a law probably not but that deals with solar it seems to me or I was told that in regard to solar plants or Farms like this the law was set up to deal with Eastern Oregon not the Mid Valley and that's bothersome I'm also bothered by the fact that I think it's more of a political issue that it's along I-5 and and we can all just see that and see what we're doing I guess efu means that it never has made anything differently it's exclusive Farm use and this is not several concerns of me in the Pacific Flyway that's right through there there's a 600 acre plus uh I don't know what to call it it's about two to three miles north um that you just thank you U.S department of AG it's Wildlife Refuge for Birds that's definitely within not your um your concentric circles there's a local elk herd I'm going to say between 80 and 100 that move along the corridor there from the Coburg Trails up to the exit in Coburg and all the way down to I'm going to say at least Indian hit and uh you know fencing off an area this big I can't imagine the impact it oh wow dang it I miss him thanks okay thank you uh Lois Hawk and then Jim Fairchild is next sorry we'll we'll take care of that for the other projects you have in Oregon uh and I'm sorry can you can you say that again oh Mr Tran could you describe some of the other projects that your company has developed in Oregon and uh is there a sister project that would look very similar to this one that we could uh you know see the look on maps and see what it looked like and and talk to some of the locals and see how they felt that the project went thank you that is a great question this would actually be the first project that we developed in the state of Oregon that's why I think it's very crucial to come to meetings like this to hear a lot about the local community because you know as we stated before there's a lot of things that we don't know um and you all live here and you guys know the best about it so there's a lot of intricate details that you can't find online that you can only have in um so this would be the first one and we're hoping to learn a lot and get a lot of these comments so we could put a list together and extrapolate some data that makes us a better project but I would like to say that Oregon State University has some projects for agrawal dance so I'm sure if you if you reach out to the university they might be able to point you in the right direction for some things that have already been built do you have any other product rural areas somewhere else in the country that we could look at and and look at the history on yeah we do have a portfolio projects built throughout the United States it's easiest to find them on our website for qsales.com there's nothing in particular that I can name off top of my head that would be something that's easy to visit however do we have information online and if you want we can go to like after this and get some contact information I can send you some links to some of the projects that we built right right and and I have a comment yesterday in the New York Times they actually had an article on what is happening to rural Farmland across the country in in Solar Development and uh it was in fact the reason I even looked at it was I saw this don't destroy our farmland and it was a poster someone was holding up in the picture and I read it and uh it was It was kind of sad because it talks about the fact that our Farmland is so much cheaper to acquire than stuff near Urban centers and they can take advantage of the fact that our worry about sewage and septic and things like that and runoff because it's Farmland you just treat it like farmland and uh that's probably here in the particular here in the Willamette Valley we have the best soils in the country I mean and it has supported people through you know a couple hundred years and uh and it's probably the best of what's left in small farms it's a tradition that I I feel is in is as important almost as the need to to generate electricity that we do so that we should focus on smaller and that that way it's more manageable so everyone shares well I appreciate it thank you sir thank you okay we're actually going to move on to uh Yvonne Scott now and and I would just ask anybody who's online please do not unmute your line we will get to you um but um those of you who unmuted your line you're creating a little bit of noise in the in the room here um and then after Yvonne will be uh Troy paper I wrote it down hi my name is Iman Scott and I live very very close to this project actually live on Mount Tom which is bordering that um I come from a sixth generation Farm family California and you know what I know Irvine my kids live there and uh I don't want this Irvine there's a reason I moved from California I want to talk about dag it for a minute 2010 one of the very first big solar things that they put in and they abandoned it okay and we're talking thousands and thousands and thousands into our landfills so something didn't work I love technology I love going forward but when it comes to Farmland being a sixth generation California from cattle okay they drove us out of California and they took our water and they took our farmland and you know what I've never said just stand up today and I'm going to say something because right here what I want to talk about number one is visual impact okay the visual impact that it has from the freeway the visual impact that actually shines up into the homes which is my home that I sit on my deck and I had this huge Vision now of all this visual the location class of the Farmland which people have spoken today the impact to the planning in the community okay I don't want this Irvine I've said that before when I've seen other solars I drove down to California my family is and I drove through a solar area let me just tell you what I saw the homes were abandoned okay they had graffiti written on them they were Old Farm homes go down through Bakersfield go down through that area it is sad sad to see and I want you to have for your family something amazing I feel like you're probably a very amazing person but you know when it comes to farmland and things that the Earth doesn't make anymore that's when we have to stand up and say something for ourselves okay industrial Zone land taken away so let's look at that freeway on that side I know people that have maybe some industrial that they want to do that once you get into electrical zoning and you get into utility you're taking that away from them okay residential property values will plummet okay that's another my children and my grandchildren when these solar panels go away we're talking 40 years I have a three-year-old grandson I will be 43 year old when those are gone that disgusts my soul Wildlife my gay uh immigration elk the birds upon and Creek I love walking that area seeing what they are seeing the elk and that will make an impact on that I believe decommissioning land okay and abandonment we talked about but the other thing is I want to know how the federal government can take zoning and just change it because if that's a fact can I go to my property which is six acres right now subdivide to six because I'd love to do that for my family if I can but really you know so they could all put them on but I cannot I'm just an individual nobody okay and then fire mitigation we live in an area that is one of the worst fire areas we had to have our own people in our town by truck the city the state the county no one's helping us we're helping ourselves you know what and so when you look at that I have out solar and we know for a fact there has been fires from solar panels before it hits those Hills how are we getting there how are we going to survive those are my so there are a lot of comments in there which I appreciate um many of them did tie to a council standard so I'm gonna hit a couple of um but then um you guys can feel free after that and if we haven't answered all your questions please ask again sure um so one of them was on decommissioning so and I think that's a good opportunity to bring this up um we had it on the slide that chase brought up with our standards uh one of our standards is decommissioning meaning that the applicant in terms of their application has to submit to us how they're going to decommission the facility so they have to show all the details of what they're going to do um and then how much it's going to cost and then we review that and if we agree with that then there's two things one is they will have a condition that says at the end of the useful life the facility they will return the site to a useful non-hazardous State meaning they will have to come back to the energy facility citing Council assuming it gets approved assuming it gets built and then ultimately you know gets retired they would have",

get that now let me double check that we've got the chat and not the we haven't got the um question and answers because i know we don't want q a is turned off all right okay q a is turned off and chat's okay nobody else i'm going to put myself on mute so i don't talk too much i'm already good morning everyone who's here we'll get started in a couple minutes just letting people find the password if they need it and all that good stuff so we'll get started on 902. thanks all right it's 902 by my watch so i will go ahead and get this started stephanie do you want to go to the next slide for sure thing slow on my end sorry about that no worries uh this is me saying welcome to our third workshop um i'm sure that you are used to this drill at this point and know all about the oregon department of energy at this point too i'm really grateful to have the chance to show off our skills as a central repository of energy data information and analysis and as a venue for problem solving oregon's energy challenges with this study you can go to the next one so just the basic usual caveats that we'll be recording the meeting um we encourage the use of chat and we have staff that can answer questions there encourage participants to answer questions there too and then in addition you can also raise your hand will often bring the chats into the conversation so it's a good place to just like put something if it's on your mind without interrupting the flow and then we'll make sure we get to it and then we have public space for public comment on the end of the meeting and right now it says staff will work on determining the next date we need to get that out of here we already have the next date it's going to be july 28th will be workshop number four so we'll go to the next slide um and at this point hopefully you're all very familiar with webex but to raise your hand you started there's like an icon at the bottom um that for me looks like a little smiley face or a fist raised in the air this fist raised is actually the hand raised sign um feels a little more political than it than it really is and then um and then you'll also you can also kind of click by your own name and raise your hand that way and then um we can go to the next slide and we can skip this one at this point i think hopefully everybody is familiar with webex um and then same sort of drill as in the past with how the meeting will be facilitated i'll be moderating today what's different is stephanie will be our lead staff today um she is the economist that was specifically hired to handle some of the issues that are going to come up today for this study uh so we're really excited to have her and you'll get to see a lot of her today and then um like i said time at the end for public comment and then on the work group agreements um these are these are some agreements that we've been using for our meetings this year we really just want to make sure that we foster an inclusive and respectful meeting today we know that there's issues um just like last time and the time before that there are just differing opinions on in this work group and it's our job as the department of energy not necessarily to find agreement among all of you but to capture those different opinions on all the different sides but we also want to make sure that we have room for recommendations so as you're thinking and talking about things that you wish were different i hope that you can also think about ways that you could possibly solve those problems that you want to bring up and just remember as we go to be respectful of others even if they disagree with you of course we have again time limitations we have a bunch of people presenting for 10 to 15 minutes today but we also want to save space for the the breakout sessions and then the discussion of those because that's really where we're planning on getting from all of you your thoughts on the and the costs uh issues that we're going to bring up today so that's kind of the the bread and butter we want to set up and have you hear from others that aren't aren't necessarily on the work group although some of our presenters are but then also have the space to share new ideas those recommendations that we've talked about that we can make as a group in the final report with that if there's technical issues linda ross in the chat is a good person to contact you can also bug me and i'm happy to see if i can figure something out for you i'm either logistically or or technically so um those are two options there anything you want to add stephanie i think that sounds good okay awesome all right next slide and then our agenda today i'm just just a heads up um the agenda we sent out had a list of presenters we have added um a presenter to talk about a project uh for patu wind today and then we also had a request to add uh raphaelas to flanders from bonneville environmental foundation i think if we hadn't heard back from her right by yesterday so we'll continue to try to grab raph and see if she can come and present at that workshop number four on that project we heard that request loud and clear if that's not a possibility we can work on figuring out some other way to make sure we hear about that project so just want to make sure you know this is your work group we're listening and when we get suggestions we're doing our best to honor those and we'll continue to do that throughout the process we'll also make sure we on our breaks it's a long day so just know we'll make sure we keep those and then you next slide and then um just basically a quick note that our objective is to examine those opportunities to encourage development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects that contribute to economic development and local energy resiliency so that's our mission statement as a staff and hopefully for you all as a group today on the next slide and i think it's on to you right stephanie yes yes we're gonna keep the introduction um pretty brief today uh because we really do want to give as much time to our speakers as possible um so really we're just going to walk through the questions um that we have discussed in the past about this area um so you can keep them in mind as you're listening to the speakers today and if any questions form along these things please do ask the speakers as we go so to start with the different um we really want to look at what is small-scale renewable projects from the larger scale and utility skill projects we want to look at the economic benefits that are common between these and unique to small-scale projects and how can these benefits be and then we want to look into resilience what are the potential resilience benefits of these projects um how can we differentiate between resilience benefits that accrue to individual customers versus communities versus the grid um and how can they be valued uh then go into the open i'm going to other businessmen everybody we're all hearing it i'm trying to see if somebody's off mute all right i'll move into the next slide so after other benefits those can include um health climate et cetera but we do want to identify those as well and then getting into rate impacts and costs um so what are the rate impacts of these projects um what are they going to be for the participants and owners of the project and what are they going to do to overall utility rates um for non-participants in the project um go into costs what are the unique costs we we've talked in prior meetings you know the different economies of scale and how we might not be getting those necessarily with small scale and we just want to see how big those are what things can be done to overcome them if there's any barriers as we discussed in a prior workshop that can be used to mitigate some of those additional costs um and then just other questions what gaps and information um do we have regarding these costs what data do we need um these are the kind of things that we want to be thinking about as we move into the final report alright so have those in mind as we go through our stakeholder um presentations today so we have six wonderful speakers lined up for you um and we're gonna go in this order it's a little um changed from what i had originally planned just due to time restrictions for uh some of our um speakers today so we're going to start with dave muldahl from energy trust and i will pass it over to dave thanks stephanie good morning everyone um just a quick shout out thank you of staff for the excellent work that you're doing here convening this discussion it's a big big mercurial topic i just wanted to thank you profoundly again my name is dave moldaul i'm the senior program manager at energy trust of oregon i manage the other renewables program kind of the unfortunately named non-solar side of the renewable sector at energy trust primarily focused on in conduit hydropower project development and biopower project development next slide next slide there we go thank you uh so quick boiler plate and then i'll get into the costs and benefits from a quick summary so energy trust of oregon is a 501c3 not for profit for those of you on the call that may not know it we operated operate under a grant agreement with the opuc we provide comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and financial incentives to serve customers of the five investor-owned utilities in oregon so our core business is to provide incentives for cost-effective energy efficiency projects and help pay for the above market costs of renewable energy facilities under 20 megawatts of nameplate capacity since 2002 we've provided expertise and financial incentives to support installation of over 20 000 now this slides a little bit out of date net metered solar projects most of those being residential solar 46 small wind turbines 14 hydroelectric plants 12 biogas cogeneration facilities as well as two biomass and two geothermal facilities over the years we've learned",

        "text": " some certainly some lingering questions around what usdoe is suggesting for a definition of clean hydrogen versus how some state programs may be addressing it and that's certainly a potential barrier right now um and then you know yeah i'm just wondering if you might have a section of here are things we would like to see changed in the an appendix at the back and include include that as one of them as as part of the study so uh we um you know are required to identify uh the to uh production and consumption in oregon and as part of that we will um what um you know opportunities are you know possible or currently in use uh in other jurisdictions to address those um so you know we'll likely list a range of of possible solutions um as opposed to suggesting a specific pathway for the legislature uh and then i just wanted to mention i'm glad that you brought up heat pumps as well um you know there there's an on a long-standing question around kind of to what degree uh we we can or should electrify the built environment um likely a great deal of it will be electrified but certainly um you know natural gas utilities are at work you know certain technologies or supporting them like natural gas heat pumps um and so you know with those potentially on the market it's possible that that could you know maybe build in some some continued use of non-electrified and uses in in the built environment well i was actually thinking in terms of ones that are electrified with the with the supplement in order not to encourage the use of natural gas heat pumps that use it for every day and not just the extremes sure thank you i would i would even i would even accept a natural gas fuel fuel pump for a hybrid just on the grounds that it's not going to be used very often and therefore it's not going to do real absolute disaster to our environment to you know for the climate change effects thank you thanks kathy i'm going to turn to a few others in the chat but kathy if you have more questions or comments feel free to raise your hand or put in the chat we can come back to you um a couple other comments um one from about being interested to hear more about the process from moving from identifying barriers to developing potential solutions there's also a little bit more chatter about the um whether it's a typical startup hype or or their sort of um around the isata price predictions and then um seshwith had a question in the or a comment in the chat he also had his hand raised so we're happy to unmute you special that if you'd like to ask um but in the chat he thinks that there should be more discussion on the efficiency improvements and hydrogen electrolyzers because they would have a material impact on its cost um there's definitely um discussions of that certainly in analyses of uh forecasted costs those are included kind of under you know new technological breaks breakthroughs as well as just economies of scale such as we unmuted you if you wanted to add anything more to that my audible sorry about that yes awesome uh hi everyone this is sasha troy with renewable northwest so uh renewable northwest we did our hydrogen renewable hydrogen policy principles last summer so we looked at a lot of what you're working on but mostly on the production i was just wondering uh the definition that you know odo is looking to kind of use in the report related to carbon intensity i think that's helpful we also considered that as part of the the question i have is has odo considered like looked at the grid mix as of now in oregon and looked at whether great charged electrolyzers would be you know clean as per as per the and uh i think that would be a a good thing to look at because as we decarbonize our electric grid uh you know there even if we don't see the grid charge electrolyzer being green right now in the next five or ten years it may be considered green or clean there may be particular hours during the day when the marginal generation is gas where the hydrogen produced would not be considered clean but you know other hours where the solar or wind is you know the the dominant or marginal generation in those as hydrogen could be considered clean based on the definition so i think the great mix would be an important thing to look at because right now based on the current economics just using curtailed renewable electricity is not cost effective uh in the near term for hydrogen production so uh there might be you know some trade-offs between using uh renewable electricity directly or you know charging the electrolyzer from the grid so i think that would be an important thing to look at thanks thank you those are all uh great suggestions i just want to clarify for the purposes of this study we are um focusing um on you know we're using that definition that was given in the um in the study bill uh focusing on quote-unquote renewable resources um and to also michelle detwiler's question um we um would include hydropower in that the only reason that it's not considered quote-unquote renewable for the purposes of the rps as mentioned is because of the age of some of the facilities so while we we think that relying on the rps definition um of renewable for the most part is very valuable we would include hydropower in it for that reason um because oregon certainly does consider hydropower to be renewable just not always eligible for the renewable portfolio standard but with respect to the grid mix certainly um we've looked at some of the some of the the recent um calculations there especially from the the organ clean fuels program um so they have that for electricity and you know right now it doesn't seem to um meet um for the most part the the usd definition but then also raises that question of you know the usd definition is at the point of production so if you're using an electrolyzer there are no emissions at the point of production unless you're including anyway so you know there is kind of that question of well does that include the emissions associated with the electricity as well like you know or if they're only co-located it's at least unclear to me and it's certainly open to any other interpretations of that um from other folks here great and i think jessica was going to add a link to the electricity resource mix um promotes page as a resource for this group it looks like you got michelle's question about hydropower shannon was asking about electrolyzer efficiency is unlikely to move much at what we'll do better is a capex per rate of hydrogen production maybe more of a comment um and that capex could go down to 10 times easily sometimes split we're sometimes improving or degrading behavior at this like in nature data i think shannon i didn't catch all of that but we did catch what you had in the chat there did you want to add to oh sorry i didn't realize you unmuted me i have two zoom meetings going at the same time here so um uh yeah so um the question was about uh uh electrolyzer capex and performance is that what the discussion was at yeah we were just kind of going through some of the um some of the ideas on the chat yeah so i mean basically we've been we work with a number of electrolyzer companies uh all over the world actually and um there's a lot of hype in this field right now and but if you look at it fundamentally the efficiencies are sort of wet where they're at you can get improvements of efficiency at the um you know at the expense of um rate of production of current density um you can get higher current densities potentially at the same efficiency but that's not really a number that's going to change all that much we're going to be somewhere around 70 efficiency probably 75 percent i'm electric to hydrogen um um and then um and then but what is coming down dramatically and pretty much everybody is seeing this is the capital expense and i would you know encourage to have a sort of more aggressive than probably typical in the types of models you guys do for um scaling electrolysis because i mean if you look at all these industries batteries solar cells all of them they all scaled and had cost reductions dramatically exceeding all predictions that people made over the last 20 years and it you know the exact same thing is going to happen to electrolyzers technically they're actually very simple devices they're not complicated to make they are minimal to large scale production there's no material resource constraints um and they'll be learning curves that will dramatically lower the cost so i you know i i really do predict in the next decade or so we'll have 10 times less capex than historically has been assigned and then that really does open up and i think that is what we really need to be planning for in oregon this idea of you know we have this congested electric system it's hard to build new but there's a lot of high value end-use cases for hydrogen right now that you guys highlighted and there'll be more coming online and so we just need to co-develop renewables with uh electrolyzers and use electrolyzers for um you know grid stabilization uh because we that's one thing that's coming also is dramatic ability to to to vary the load to the electrolyzer systems pretty much all the technologies are starting to build this in not just the more expensive proton exchange membrane ones pretty much all of them will be able to very load by a factor of at least five so you know that's going to be a huge huge advantage uh coupled with low cap x so i think that really is the way things are going to go uh you know the question is you know how do you integrate that into all the planning that's all difficult um because it's not you know it's hard to it's hard to it's hard to be you know you have some uncertainty in all these predictions but um that's certainly my view so yeah thanks for giving me a chance to give some comments yeah thank you shannon i was actually a comment from ken that kind of tracks with that that i'll just mention where he said it's virtually impossible to develop the amount of renewables needed to meet goals given transmission congestion and intermittent processes and he referenced a bpa cluster study that effectively declined almost all of the transmission requests in the region and he thinks that they'll need to be some alternative to power transmission to get at renewables we need",

        "text": " transparent decision making regarding program proposals initiatives and amendments that is inclusive of rto participants and non-participants cost allocation that costs shared broadly among customers based upon principles of cost causation including for the revenue requirements of existing transmission market power again similar to the independence uh was uh suggested by multiple commenters that market design should mitigate market power and disincentivize market but that this is also something required by ferc reliability any market design should strive to improve regional reliability which may include imposing minimum resource requirements on participants continuation of this state policy market design must take into account and be compatible with state ghg and clean energy policies which in oregon's case means the market should facilitate cost-effective and timely decarbonization through the integration of clean energy resource adequacy market design should ensure that all participants are held to a common standard for transmission and capacity planning to ensure reliability in r.a an ra standards should be applied equitably across participants and should be resource agnostic with regard to the contribution of capacity value for example from non-wires alternatives and distributed resources price formation price formation within the market should provide appropriate compensation for the energy capacity and flexible attributes of accurately price scarcity and adequately reflect the opportunity costs of use limited hydropower and then a few comments on voluntary entry and exit the decision to join in rto should be voluntary and to some extent the decision to commit specific resources or transmission in the market should also be voluntary there should be a reasonable withdrawal rights should an entity seek to end its participation in rto although one commenter notes potential for progressive erosion of internal institutional capacity such as with transmission operations that might occur after joining an rto so those two slides really uh sum up the core principles that were suggested by commenters lots of agreement on many of them but open the floor to feedback and comments here on on those proposed core principles um so the the most important one i think is not listed here which is the market ought to provide uh more net benefit more value for in three ways first economically pretty obvious you know decreased costs secondly from quality of service benefits reliability resilience and third environmental reduction of environmental impact whether it's you know greenhouse gas emissions or impacts and that includes all the resources not you know any particular one everything has impacts can a market provide for a resource mix that has less impact and meets our climate and clean energy goals so i really think you know while it may just be assumed that that's a guiding principle i think that really needs to be effectively the first improved overall value for customers so adam this is frank i would i would echo what fred just said i would also say there is a transparency requirement associated with many of these attributes which gets back somewhat to governance but someone to the specific execution of them as well any other comments or feedback on as i have been engaging you know what are the nascent western states committee uh committees um i will say that the the principle between um not having a state be able to sort of dictate to others and some of these other principles around what we want uh as oregon policy is described are a little in uh tension as we try to work with a larger footprint and i think this has come up earlier in the conversation but i think that tension is as real and complex and so the more sort of anyone is about what they what they want from an rto um the more complex and intention that conversation with other uh states becomes just by its very nature and so it's a balancing act to be aware of these principles don't all necessarily simply exist at the same time but but are in somewhat in tension with each other i have a bit of a technical follow-up question uh not related to that litha but separately um for anyone who has um for those who might not be familiar with this topic several commenters did bring up the opportunity costs of use limited as it relates to economic dispatch and and i'm curious if anyone uh can expound on that for those who might not be familiar with that with that issue sort of a a uniquely northwest one in some ways so so this is fred it's a it's a big it's a big important issue to be sure but there's every resource has constraints even you know energy efficiency which you know we all at the northwest energy coalition really love uh because it delivers and it's very low impact that has constraints too they're not an operational sense really it's there it's not but every other kind of resource whether we call it energy limited or not is going to you know as the e-cig energy system integration group says in their six resource adequacy principles there is no perfect you know there's no perfect capacity resource but i think we do have to recognize the importance of the hydropower system it's really immense capabilities but also the limitations that it's got and how about another another technical follow-up on something here and again it's uh i'm picking on the price formation bullet here but um curious the stakeholder perspectives uh on accurately uh pricing scarcity now that's uh can be a hotly uh contested um whether we you know markets have price caps or or not and um curious perspectives of stakeholders on how important that is in an rto to accurately price scarcity here well if this is fred again nobody will jump in on that one scarcity is a you know it's it's a reality of any market it's uh of any pricing structure i think the question is the role that it you have uh texas with you know energy-only market and scarcity is a major component of what they're doing but there are scarcity issues in all markets and you know not something to be afraid of but it's something to manage and prepare for and you know that sends a useful bit of information when you have a scarcity price but what will be done with it is a function of the design so i think it's important to recognize but by the way one other thing maybe not a new principle but something to consider is one of the things that the market designs have really struggled with is the relationship between short-term price including scarcity and long-term cost price value whatever you want to call it uh you know we have a range of approaches to that ranging from you know mandatory auction full you know forward capacity markets in a couple of places in the east to something like texas energy only to california more of an administrative model you know to something in between that relationship between short run you know price discovery market depth and then what happens over the long run is actually very important and i don't think anybody has really solved it so that would mean we have a chance to tackle that and see if we can do better adam i'll pipe it on price formation for the three listed types of pricing you've listed in that bullet i think we might be able to park capacity pricing for the moment given our previous conversation about what is more essential and less essential to market design in our region given the status of the regional re program i think you could argue our bilateral approach to using nodes in the west with a standardized contract for some types of of energy does a decent job of of pricing in the west we have um trackable data on what's happening to prices when they spike when shortages are occurring i do think an rto by its nature is better designed to give better information on how energy prices are being formed to fred's point the design really matters and transparency the market matters including having an effective market monitor but the area that captures my attention more as an area of potential for the northwest and for oregon is on the flexibility of and coming up with better price formation mechanisms through an rto for ancillary services to figure out what what are batteries actually providing us on the grid what is the hydro system providing in ways that aren't priced in today as we move into a much more um renewables based and decentralized system than we have today that that seems like a key thing to zeroing on for oregon for price thanks for that for that feedback any other additional comments on principles um particularly anything that's missing that'd be good to make sure we get out there and discuss hey adam i there's one of the principles that we included in our um feedback that i didn't see here that i'd like to hear other people's perspective on is um and i have to be careful with how i talk about this because there's nuances in the terms i use the inclusion of a greenhouse gas or or generation resource tracking system i'm not talking about a regional carbon market i'm talking about some sort of regional tracking system that allows um for a sort of standard mechanism for tracking resource attributes that would be complementary to existing states with carbon markets and states with clean energy standards and so i was to hear if others had views on that hey this is mary just from a deq perspective and a greenhouse gas and missions accounting perspective i think that's one area that we really try to highlight in our and our comment is um that part of the development of an rto would have to have clear transparency emissions um in oregon and how they're being handled by who's distributing them and how we're going to handle the reporting of those um so it seems like something that policy could definitely design correctly that we could continue to accurately account for emissions but it would have to be thoughtful in the process and how we handle unspecified and if we're doing something like where there's wrecks or or that we currently don't do so um i think i don't have a lot uh to say in terms of recommendations but just that that's something that definitely would be thinking about in terms of rto i guess uh maybe this question for nicole was a follow-up the concept you're talking about how would that interface or how would you see that interfacing with regis's wreck um that's a great question so uh our tracking system here in this region only tracks the attributes of re renewable generation so it tracks the um the clean energy attributes or the wrecks right there is there are constructs from other markets out there where you could just track generation attributes so an example is the pgm generation attribute tracking system and um that system i believe and others can correct me if i'm wrong it's part the market operates across states with different levels of carbon mandates and clean energy standards but seems to do a good job of providing an opportunity to track the attributes of all generation so that helps with the acknowledgement that there are unspecified resources in the system um that",
