        "text": " on September 22nd 2023 the noi provides basic information about the also include or indicates the permits that the facility may require and potential impacts to various resources and listing map of properties that would be crossed by the facilities the noi is valid for two years that means the applicant has until September 22nd 2025 to submit their application once the department has issued a project order however in the case of this particular project the applicant is indicated they will submit their application by or in July next year 2024 at this time at the end of this presentation uh we'll be soliciting comments from the public and state agencies local governments and tribal governments and the uh the public comment period for comments on the noi closes December 1st for this year in 2023 after we've received all comments the department will release a project order which will list the application submitt requirements in applicable statutes schools and standard the Second Step based on the application the will once the project order is is issued the applicant will submit an application um and from there the department will review the application in coordination with state agencies local governments and tribal governments this process does take some time um as there's regularly additional requests for additional information uh provided by the department to the applicant um that an applicant must address before the department can determine that the application is once determined once completeness is determined on an application the department will hold informational meeting another informational meeting that's another opportunity comment following receipt of a complete application the department will then prepare a draft proposed order which contains our recommended bindings of pro clim non-compliance with citing standards as well as the conditions we recommend Council impos under each of those standards which of those 16 General standards and additional we'll initiate another round of public involvement once we issue the draft proposed order at that stage there will be a public comment period and a public hearing persons who wish to contest the project must participate during the DP public hearing uh to be potential potentially eligible to participate the case following issu of the DPO the proposed order will uh be issued and that will contain changes to the draft proposed order based on feedback received from Council and reviewing agency partners in the public at the proposed order those who commented on the draft proposed order May request part of status in the case following the conclusion of the contested case or if no persons request party status in the contested case the council will issue a final decision on whether to approve or deny a site certificate if Council authorizes the site certificate and the developer seeks to make any major changes to the facility in the future the developer will need to request an amendment to the certificate which will initiate another round of council review and public participation what is not on this flowchart slide is the appeal path uh final FC decisions are appealable directly to the Oregon Supreme Court and they have six months uh within which to issue their final next slide please I've said it uh a few times in my presentation thus far uh reviewing agency and reviewing agencies are state agencies local governments tribal governments and in some cases federal agencies that we at the organ Department of energy seeking input from during our VI and proposed facilities these agencies and governments help us determine what studies should be conducted which permits are required and what statutes administrative rules and government ordinances apply to a specific facility at this point in our process we've already reached out to each reviewing agency to solicit comments during the noi phase and we'll continue to coordinate with our reviewing agency partners throughout this proposed facility as I mentioned we're in the notice of intent stage and the notice of intent really is uh desktop level analysis of a proposed project while we're happy to receive comments any comments or particular really at this point in our process interested in comments that are related to specific resources part of the inent the applicant had to conduct desktop studies for resources within and near the site boundary using the specific distances shown on this slide for example uh for the fish and wildlife habitat and land use resources um desktop studies were conducted within a half mile of the uh threatened dangered species and opportunities uh had a study area of five mons and for Scenic resources and public services there is a 10 miles study area based on what we hear from from you tonight reviewing agencies and anyone throughout this com noi com period uh these study area distances may stay the same or they increase study areas determine how far out from the facility the applicant must evaluate potential impacts to a given resource an evaluation of imput some of these resources can significant onsite survey work such field surveys to evaluate impacts that Wildlife have forend danged um if you have any thoughts or comments on about potential impact of the project or to resources please include those in your comments if you if you provide comments tonight um next slide please in the F section process applicants may elect to undergo the local land use review process or seek the council land use determination in the case of this project the applicant has requested that the council make the land use determination in the notice of attenta applicant is indicated that the local land use requirements of um matilla Mor count would be Consolidated into the state RW however the applicant can change up that decision um on what land use review process they want to seek up until the point they submit their application in recognition that matilla and Moro counties both are experts of their own land use codes and ordinances the department appointed both the unella County Board of Commissioners and the more County Board of Commissioners as the special Advisory Group for this project the two special advisory groups the department has requested that both Moro County andilla County provide a list of the local appable substantive criteria the facility would be evaluated against um would be evaluated against um next slide following the applicants portion of this presentation the public will have an opportunity to provide verbal comments on the proposed facility you also have public also has an opportunity to submit written comments throughout the end of the day on December 1st 2023 these comments and all comments our carded record and will be made available to the applicant next slide just in general the department has created a lot of information um in hopes that it would be helpful to the process our website contains a public guide as I mentioned and a series of handouts to help they explain the F process and how it works how to better kind participate in that General um the website also includes options to sign up to receive email notices on specific facilities or rle makings and to also comment on typing projects here on the bottom of this slide is in green is the URL for this particular project project page guess we could leave this up for a short bit should anyone like to write it down or take a photo um that said as a reminder these slides are already available on our project page um and lastly next slide this is my information for those listening over the phone my phone number is 5323 my name is Chase big Walker please feel free anyone to contact me with any questions that you may have um with that I'll now turn things over to the applicant to both introduce themselves and provide more specific information thank you Chase and thank you to the Department of energy and the council for allowing us to speak on behalf of the hum till andoro County connect project thank you all in attendance this evening and virtually we appreciate the interest in our project thank you for attending tonight my name is Weston Putman manager of public relations for umil Electric Cooperative this evening I am joined by manager of engineering for UVC Cole bod land use specialist fortil Electric Hollins and together we are joined by several representatives from Power Engineers who is a consultant supporting and assisting U on this project so as Chase mentioned our presentation or our focus of our presentation is going to be more focused on the details and a little bit of the facts and figures of the itself so with any project regardless the size that human electric is getting ready to undertake orend or proposing we do what we call an analysis to identify a purpose and need and for this instance it's a purpose and need for new transmission as this as Chase mentioned is a 230 Kil transmission line during this analysis we were actually able to identify three that we believe will bring value from the umcc project and I'm going to go through it briefly in this slide but then the next slide I want to share a map that we feel brings a little bit more value to each and then I'm going to be able to talk to through so the first one is to increased system reliability and capacity of youtil Electric's 230 KB transmission line or system the second one is to support Economic Development and future growth within the region again that's both Umatilla and moral counties and really e organ as a whole the third one is to create a transmission path for renewable energy so now I'd like to share the map on screen and as you can see I want to start with the first one again increased system reliability and capacity as you can see on the screen the two green lines represent util Electric's current 230 kilovolt transmission system as you can see we have one on the east side near Herston and etilla in Umatilla County on the west side we have one in bman in Moro County however what you don't see is a line connected two what the umcc project would do is create an added layer of reliability and resiliency to this system so as of now with what we currently have if a major outage natural disaster weather event whatever it may be we're to take out system with our current capacity we are very limited to what we're able to do from an outage restoration perspective and a timely and uh matter this would create an adday of redundancy so if if anything were to happen in bourman or heran and this all went out for whatever reason we would be able to reroute power directly to the other 230 KB creating an added layer of resilience for number two again to assist and support Economic Development and future growth in the region and for this I want to highlight a certain area that some of you may be familiar with in recent years and especially in recent months as we know the Army chemical Depo transferred ownership to the Columbia Development Authority and with that we as the electric utility unit electric are anticipating a lot of growth a lot of development from economic job standpoint coming into the area and we want",

        "text": " about that so thank you very much for your time and and educating me in this whole process I am looking forward to the subcontractor uh implementation uh because we all know as as I said in our meeting uh job one is to provide safety and access to ambulance and emergency services to all of our constituents in Washington County and um and to me that's still top priority so I'm going to be watching as this subcontractor thing rolls out because I firmly believe one Ambulance Company can no longer facilitate the entire needs of the region since it's the same ambulance company for the Tri Counties so um you know that I've said that to you uh and so I'll be constantly probably bugging you asking you questions but thank you I do appreciate the time that you spent me other Commissioners I just want to say thank you for the work and we are we are at a point where we can take a deep breath and and let it out and it's um it's it's it's good work that you've done and it's been exhausting I mean there there's all sorts of changes even to the point of changing name names now from provider to clinician and all of those things so I appreciate the professional uh way you have approached all of these things and uh the fact that we can look at opportunities like subcontracting it in I I wouldn't have thought that we'd be able to do that a year ago so my hat is off to um I have a two small questions first one is could you help me understand um by the way the the slide about that has the circle with the diagram spot on I really appreciate it was very clear to follow with the memo that came with this um information I was trying to follow the board's role in all the buck four buckets and could you help me understand better the endorsed by the board bucket and then I'll ask my other question later on absolutely um the ambulance service area plan is actually approved by the by Oregan health authority so they require that you endorse it so we have taken it to you you've reviewed it you stamp it with your endorsement and then they review it um and ironically ask us for changes and then approve it U so the process is a little circular But ultimately we need your endorsement in order to submit it to them for approval so we initiate the doc yeah and then they approve it and then we endorse you endorse first first yeah and we come generally what we did the last time because it's a little circular and we'd have to come back and forth if they asked for changes is we say if there aren't any significant changes asked by the state will go with your endorsement if the state comes back and says no we need you to do something completely different we would make those changes and then come back again and have you endorse um we didn't have to do this last time they needed editorial changes so you endorse what we hope is the final version and then they approve they approve okay and then did did we reindorf there is an edits significant edits that happen comes yeah if they came back and wanted us to change um how we document how operations happen we would bring it back to you okay thank you yeah and then the other question um that I had to super minor and it was just a wording difference between clinician and the provider piece of it and I probably am internalizing the word clinician to be like a doctor or a n so that's not what you mean in the memo it says an individual so and and then I heard you say provider could be an entity so H how what are we talking about here so that's a great question um the Term Provider had been um had become kind of interchangeable between the two whether as a person delivering healthare or an entity um and a lot of uh professional journals and um uh professional societies are moving away from referring to an individual as a provider again because it can be used as an entity so to differentiate the two and they're adopting the term clinician um whether that is and it I think it really depends on the um the society that's adopting that change um we're we're taking our lead from the National Association of EMS Physicians um and in their style guide for their peerreview Journal um referring to EMS um personnel as clinicians that are are licensed to deliver uh medicine in the out of Hospital area okay thank you and I would just while it wasn't phrased as a question commissioner Willie our subcontract ours AMR subcontract with Metro West went into effect on Monday and they have been deployed four to six times per Metro West report out today so it and it apparently very well very smoothly with wacka and with everything in the system you're welcome commissioner Rogers do you have anything you'd like to add no Madam chair I appreciate all the work this is complex stuff and and I think that staff has doing a good job thank you uh as mentioned um in your presentation there are these four significant pieces I appreciate the diagram uh that you presented tonight and ensuring that we all have a good sense for the different pieces uh over the last few years you've taken us through uh building a system right the whole EMS Alliance uh and really exemplary work over the years so thank you for having that grounding diagram uh as we go through potential enhancements uh into future years I will add that in having conversations with the other two Tri count chairs about uh ambulance service across our region particularly in light of this National Workforce shortage that we have for paramedics and even for uh emergency medical technicians um I have really come to appreciate and I think they too are a bit envious of the work that you have taken us through over the last five years in rearching the system and with the approach uh the the new best practices approach that you all have um created for us to support So once again big thanks uh and onward ho we go together um and I'll put in a plug for anyone who wishes to uh become a paramedic or an EMT uh Washington county is a wonderful place to live work and play so please do consider careers right here in Washington County Oregon so with that I would like to ask for a motion to adopt the resolution and Order amending the Emergency Medical Services administrative rules as set forth in exibit a so move we have a motion and a second all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you Commissioners any opposed the motion carries unanimous five to zero that brings us to our second public comment opportunity of this evening clerk MOS do we have anyone who's been waiting patiently to address us this evening thank you chair Haron I did not see anyone sign up but would any member in the auditorium wish to provide public comment on any Cy Rel topic up to five minutes give you just a moment to raise your hand come forward get my attention not seeing anyone in the room would any member online wish should Prova comment on any calendar related topic for up to 5 minutes give you just a moment to utilize raise hand function not seeing any hands shair Harington thank you clerk Moss uh next I'll move to board announcements and uh before I get to uh describing our or listing out our future meetings I would like to touch on a couple of things first and foremost I would like to recognize that one of our assistant County Administrator David Martinez is retired during his Service uh here in Washington County in fact here in Oregon as well and we want to thank you sir for giving us your time your expertise and your patience uh uh here in Washington County uh we have greatly appreciated having you here on Team One Washington County and wish you the best in your future endeavors thank as I mentioned earlier tonight is our last Board of commissioner business meetings for this calendar year but County Work continues through the end of this year and into our next New Year and no matter the fact that there are school vacation holidays coming up many different family holid holiday celebrations we have some staff here uh both at Washington County and at Clean Water Services who do their work 24 hours a day across the full seven days a week each and every day to make sure that Washington county is a safe habitable place for all of us to uh live and Thrive so while folks like me are enjoying a couple of weeks of downtime and uh out of formal meetings I am grateful for the services of our staff members who work in the jail and in Community Corrections and courtrooms and with clean water services keeping our waste water recovery uh treatment plants going who make sure our pump stations are working just fine so that flows are flowing uh and that we're protecting the health of the toatin river so uh thank you very much employees for yet again another very productive year here in 2023 I know that my colleagues join me and looking forward to working with all of you on team Washington County into our new year of 2024 and for all of you I hope you're able to enjoy some quieter time over these next couple of weeks uh and enjoy some family time as well and lastly I will do the really boring thing of announcing our future meetings please do not show up here next Tuesday we won't be here no work session meeting no formal board meeting not next Tuesday December 19th nor Tuesday December 26th and guess what Tuesday January 2nd we're not going to have meetings that day either but our work for the new year starts that week after the New Year's holiday we look forward to once again re reconvening in work session with our staff on Tuesday January 9th starting bright and early at 9:00 a.m. in work session on Thursday January 11th we're going to have a very full day as has a round table starting at 9:00 a.m. at the Clean Water Services Rock Creek campus in Hillsboro and then Tuesday January 16th will be our first double where we have work session starting at 9 then reconvening likely around 1 p.m. and a board meeting that starts at 10: and if it's a short agenda we'll bump that work session up and yes we have a couple more meetings in the month of January but that's the Slate for now and uh we continue to um uh post meeting agendas on the Washington County website uh Washington county.gov the best Washington County in our nation uh and you can find more there that's it from me any other board",

        "text": " but floating offshore in development um and then yeah what could these impacts be you know shipping routes and port access for other coastal activities uh transmission um as a reminder the grid can't get the power i'm floating offshoring wounded without transmission so transmission is another really key topic that surfaced in the literature review um floating offshore wind needs offshore transmission to bring energy to land and we'll need some upgrades to the existing transmission on land as well so with all this new new need for transmission and upgrades there are a lot of questions um how might economies of scale play a role with transmission um you know larger and larger projects will require more transmission because there are optimization opportunities there i have a kind of questions on that on the right hand side of the slide but what are the various possible configurations for offshore transmission how might existing limitations on the onshore transmission effect floating offshore wind development what are the required upgrades and how much could offshore an onshore transmission cost um these types of questions are examples of more technical questions and while feedback for more technical minded folks and entities is likely to be valuable here we welcome all feedback so plug in where you can we also have questions that could that could be thought of as transmission optimization questions and those revolve around the potential ideas for how storage could help with potential floating offshore wind deployment ideas for how transmission might be able to help optimize and provide benefits to the existing onshore transmission system so feedback around the idea of subsidy backbone transmission lines that could serve oregon and other west coast states is flagged how floating offshore when associated transmission improvements could help add resilience to coastal power systems is another opportunity under this category so yeah there's just this is a big category and we're looking for good and food thank you yeah uh so uh we'll pause here i know we have um about 14 minutes left so just any specific kind of clarifying questions on on what we're hoping to sort of hear from folks on the comment portal about ports or transmission infrastructure just pause here for a moment give people time to think go back to this line if that's helpful so i think um jason said this before in terms of the ports question um so there's a i think a good spot for some some of those port upgrade and and the study that boom is doing in here uh oh here's a couple questions how possible do you think it is for more significant transmission upgrades to the coast to follow offshore wind development on the oregon coast and another one is does the literature review report identify at what point transmission upgrades or port improvements would be necessary uh jason are there any kind of existing studies or reports that you've reviewed that are in the draft that people might you know build on with additional comments or or are you sort of really looking for some more studies or reports on those two points yeah i mean i think one question one of those questions was pretty discreet yeah there's been some i think there need to be more studies but there have been some studies on the existing transmission infrastructure and some numbers are between the two and two and a half gigawatt for what could be integrated without substantial transmission we have questions about what what these upgrade costs could be you know substantially subjective term i'm not sure quantitatively what or what necessary that could mean um so there's a lot of questions about all these topics how how could onshore land transmission what was that other question about expanding transmission to accommodate offshore wind or something yeah yeah other one uh-huh it's all possible right i mean we're in the early stages and so um this end product you know just a reminder is going to have more questions in it than answers right um i think we're going to flag a lot of things and highlight you know topics that are you know really more primary essentially just to just to help the legislature understand this issue at a relatively high level and you know maybe not lose them in the weeds so much but you know it'll certainly have an appendix it'll have a lot of great data in it and it's a weedy subject so those that want to venture into it can can go for it but we're really shooting for kind of high level stuff yeah and i think that the question about more significant transmission upgrades you've flagged that the literature has really shown that to be a really significant area and key topic so if there are other reports and studies in fact um in the bubble chart that jason had showed before there's some other activity occurring in california through a grant from dod to study transmission more specifically so that will be something to watch as well and in terms of point um identify at what point transmission upgrades or port improvements would be necessary i think that's asking like point in time i'm not sure if the literature really has that level of specificity that we've seen so far but if you do see studies or reports or have some experience on that on that timing question i think we really welcome that there's a question of when will the military needs assessment summary be available to the public i think that might be referring to the oregon renewable energy siting assessment that project is a dod funded project and the grant for that requires the project to be complete by the end of march so you should expect some information available on our website about that project um in a couple in a few months here in uh and then have you reviewed east coast east coast state studies and what have you learned from them for the oregon study i'm going to reply to this one and say that literature report that we have posted it's in draft form and has um some references to the east coast studies that have been reviewed in the endnote section as well as kind of a synopsis of what the themes were from that so just gonna point people to that draft literature review report on that question because it's a really good one there's a lot of more activity on the east coast although it's different because it's bottom fixed and not what is the oregon state environmental review process for placement of transmission lines and power storage washington has cepa thank you thanks we have a lot of material on our website about environmental review processes and requirements for citing i'll just quickly say that oregon does not have a environmental protection act it doesn't that we don't have like a nepal-like process we have a standards-based requirement um that developers have to demonstrate that those standards are met through the energy facility citing council so we have a information on our website about that um some some projects go through a county process so we have information about that too and i'll ask one of my colleagues to put a link in the chat about energy facility citing kathy added an interesting article about new technology for scotland okay thank you kathy let's see you want to switch to energy markets and rtos jason and gladly thank you richie exciting and permitting and then we will do a pause after that and we'll try to maybe go quickly because i know get through these here okay um you know i've said this is a big topic and this is one of the more important topics on about four topics by now so there's a lot of moving pieces and there's a lot of big topics that have you know i'll say it again too there's more questions than answers um at this point um so you know energy markets and regional transmission organization um these on the left kind of relate to output you know who's going to buy the energy the questions on the relay on the right kind of have overlaps with with that question about how expensive it is and who's gonna buy it um and then they also um as the name implies have some transmission implications too so a lot going on with these questions um but let's walk through them um so you can't have offshore wind without a purchaser um so that's why this is a very key topic um you know the projects won't get built unless there's somebody that buys it buys the energy from them and then questions about um the output so we're looking for input on the output i thought that i had to get that in there but for example how could output be shared across multiple off takers are there barriers or challenges with cooperative arrangements um could energy from floating offshore wind be purchased by an organ utility or could the energy be purchased by an out-of-state utility what about first mover advantages with deploying floating offshore wind and potentially being one of the first to purchase the floating offshore wind output um and then shift shifting gears to the regional transmission you know for those who want to learn more about what an rto is that's the acronym there we've included a link below to the department's rto study that just concluded at the end of last so it's it's pretty recent in the department's 2020 binaural energy report also has some background info on centralized energy markets and rtos and this is available on the department's website for now though the quick point is that many areas of the country where offshore wind is already being developed like we've talked about the east coast so that's a great example um the east coast regions have rtos that provide transmission service and do transmission and so there are a lot of nuances with rtos the department is interested in exploring how these nuances could pose benefits and challenges to floating offshore when coming to oregon um so you know like have rtos helped spur the development of floating offshore wind on the east coast was it primarily driven you know just by costs or the state mandates or were rtos you know helpful for that um could that type of transmission structure potentially be a key for helping to spur floating offshore wind development off oregon's um and then on the other hand is it possible for flooding offshoring to be developed off oregon's coast without an rto again these questions can have a level of complexity and technical nuance to them and more technical entities and utilities could be in a good position to help with feedback here but all input and ideas are welcome so please share your ideas thanks um yeah you want to do one quick check in there or you want to move on move ahead we only have five minutes so covering these slides will be full but people keep putting the questions in the chat we'll try to answer them as we go all right uh and last but not least last but certainly not least deciding improvement permitting we've talked a lot about that today um even though the component is the larger focus of this study um we'll talk about it um here because we",

I'm here today Madam chair and Commissioners to speak to you regarding item D on your agenda today appointing planning Commissioners for district two and four I applied last April when you had a and wasn't selected then to fill that and then I was contacted in the fall October November I can't quite remember to see if I still was interested because these positions were coming open I said yes I was asked by land use folks if I had anything to add to my application I said no not really and I figured I'd actually be speaking with somebody or meeting with somebody I was invited to come to the work session last week and was told it would be nine and then that item was moved to two and then basically I realized after the fact that that wasn't a place where I was going to learn more or hear a conversation it was to accept the appointments that were already decided so I just wanted to express my disappointment in the process I know everybody's busy and everything's technology now but for such an important position as a planning commissioner for four years I would recommend that at least you have one in-person interview and I feel that I was highly qualified for the position but never really got a chance to speak to that more fully and ultimately I recognize that when I looked at the packet that I received the day of the work session the map shows that every current member and person applying to be on the commission it looks inside of ugb I'm the only person that lives in a rural area and I think that's extremely important that you seek rural representation we have very different issues and I've been in this community for 45 plus years serving folks in many ways including land use so I just wanted to put that out there for the record and ask you to reconsider what you're doing with your appointments thank you thank you Lynette thank you for joining us today clerk Moss anyone else we did have one other sign up but I do not see them in the room or online so that will conclude our part for right now all right well perhaps that person will join us later in the meeting the next item on our agenda is our consent agenda today's consent agenda consists of five different items one set of minutes one item from Support Services one item from land use and transportation one item from three different departments and one item from Human Resources what are the wishes of the commission we have a motion and a second to approve today's consent agenda all those in favor please vote by saying I are raising your hand thank you Commissioners any opposed the motion carries unanimously five to zero next we'll move on to boards and commissions the first item here is to appoint Planning Commission members for district 2 and District 4 and if I could just beg for your forgiveness for a moment we have a motion before us we had six different applicants for these two positions and we have a recommendation to appoint Mike Frey and Joe Kaiser to the Planning Commission each for a four-year term expiring January 31st of 2027. what are the wishes of the commissioner Willie yeah if I could just respond I guess to Lynette thank you for our conversation last week you gave me a lot of good information I appreciate that and I just ask that you stay involved and engaged in we will certainly find a place for you we we have room on our rural roads committee if that doesn't interest you then I certainly won't keep your mind in consideration for future appointments on the Planning Commission although District 4 doesn't have any coming up I'd encourage you to stay in the play here so thank you thank you for your time last week in the motion to approve we have a motion to approve this slate second we have a motion and a second all those in favor of

what are the wishes of the commission so moved we have we have a motion and we have a second all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you Commissioners any opposed the motion carries unanimously five to zero next we have a action item and this is with regard to our upcoming strategic planning effort uh I'd like to turn things over to our County administrative officer Ms Tanya Angie Ms Angie thank you chair Harrington and good morning board I'm really pleased to bring forward to you for board action today next steps on the community strategic so the purpose of today's presentation is to describe why the county is pursuing a strategic plan review purpose of a strategic planning program discuss options for initiating the program and then memorialize board so let's let's talk about where we've and why the board has prioritized a strategic planning process the County's current strategic plan dates back to 1986. although it was updated in 1990 1993. we previously described all the changes with your board that have occurred since 1986 and we only have to remember where we were in 1986 just to realize how long ago that was technology changes are especially striking and I know personally I had to get a new phone this weekend and just even changes in one version of a phone can be really challenging approximately 10 percent of householders had home computers in 1986 10 percent of household Intel's brand new chip was released that made home computers as fast as mainframe computers of that time and the first iPhone was released in and now in 2023 the devices We Carry in our pocket are much more powerful than those home computers in 1986. so additional why in 1990s a series of measures were passed that disrupted the way property taxes were levied the result was a freeze on property taxes a reduction in local control over funding and inequities in tax rates between communities and even between County Services have also changed with the passage of the regional affordable housing measures in 2018 House Bill 2001 the passage of the American Rescue plan and as a result of the complex and interconnected issues that are facing the Washington County community and our community has changed the Washington County Community has changed since 1986 as has the organization that serves it in 1986 the population was 28 000. and 92 percent white the county budget was 107 million and we had a Workforce of today Washington County has a population of more than six hundred thousand is Inc and is increasingly ethical ethnically and racially diverse the county budget is 1.6 billion and we have more than 2 300 employees providing services to the community every day if I take you back to 1986 and a Workforce of 876. I want to share one data point that I just learned from our human resources department with the closeout of 2022. in 2022 they conducted 511 recruitments because of the diversity of our funding resources here in Washington County and we also at the same time though have Financial constraints and this is another item that has dramatically changed since the 1980s and the County's financial situation net revenue which is the dark green line is not keeping",

        "text": " you were to end it at their property, there would be those two multiplexes or the two little duplex areas that wrap around. Now, if they're going to connect the sidewalk into the commercial, then, yes, possibly adding it, or. I'm sorry, I don't know what the road is. Well, they could. They only have access to their property. Correct. There is enough room within the right of way as it's a 60 foot ride right of way with only a 24 foot paving section to be able to construct a sidewalk within the right of way. Okay. On their side, on the northern side of southwest 84th Road. Okay. That's what I'm asking. And then how much further around are you saying that. Do you have an overall area I could show you? If you just pan up toward the intersection. So you can see at the intersection of Southwest 100 street and Southwest 100 street road, there's about two lots worth of duplex one or multiplex. It's a four pack that was proposed originally. One hasn't been built. One has been built. If you go around the corner, the property line of that multiplex, where it touches the Wawa, they have constructed a sidewalk stubbed to the back of Wawa. As it is right now. Even pedestrians that go from the neighborhood to the Wawa is an unsafe situation because Southwest 100 street road traffic is probably increased by a factor of four since the construction of the Wawa. Both people coming from the east to Wawa and people leaving from Wawa going back to the east. Okay. Very good. And perhaps we can look and see if those two lots. Was there any sort of requirement for sidewalks? If not, they were built in the seventies, so there wouldn't have been a requirement for that. Gotcha. No, this is a very, very. Not to code. Not to current code subdivision. In fact, if this were a project I was working on, this would never out. This project would never be built. Kingsland country estates, the way it is right now, would never be built. Today. All of the roads are basically valleys. Every time it rains, there's six inches to a foot of water flooding down the center of the street. Any of the water that. Most of the water right now, that does not come from the existing site. I know there's some. I don't know. I don't know what your stormwater assessment has done as far as grading has, but the grading of the site itself traps a majority of the water. There is an existing berm. To Mister Zelick's point, there's actually an existing berm. The majority of 84th Avenue road that's about two to 4ft tall, depending on the area that's very densely brushed. In fact, one of the things that I didn't get time to say with my just statement was that my request would be that they try to leave as much of that as possible and if needed, put the wall or fence along their back curb so that internally, these neighbors who have lived there for. I mean, I don't know all the neighbors on that street, but most of them are elderly and a lot of them come out pretty early in the morning to take their trash out or just walking their dog to the bathroom. And they've been staring at trees their whole lives. You know, they've been living there for a very long time. My request would be that if you were going to require the landscaping and the fence, that you actually require the fence along the landscape buffer perimeter inside the property so the landscaping can be enjoyed by the people who. That makes sense. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Okay, so do we have the Gilhausens? If they want to speak, I've got two people on the list. Hey, Charles Gilhausen. 8299 Southwest 100 Lane Road with that site plan. Can you bring that back up, please, sir? I live on the corner. Bring the aerial view, please, sir. Did we get your address, mister? Giss. 82 99 Southwest 100 Lane Road. Okay, thank you. Okay. I live in that house right there. He'll give us. Okay, then reset the time and start it now. So I look at those trees every day. When they brought wawa in, they had. We had like three foot oak trees. I don't. I'm not sure the count, but there was probably about five of them. And I come home one day, they were gone. They cleared them all. Now I see from my house, I see all the way to 200 as I never did before. Now I'm sure they put that. They put that fence up right there along behind Wawa. They also have the sidewalk like Joe was talking about. But all of those trees that they're talking about. The whole area that he had. He's gonna clear all that out and I'm gonna be looking at a wall. No offense, but I'd rather look at the trees than the wall. The other problem I have is the 30 units that's adding 60 more cars. Driving up and down that road. Right in front of my house where my grandkids play. We have kids all in that neighborhood that play there all the time. Everybody walks. Like Joe said, there's no sidewalks. It's very dangerous. And if we're bringing 60 more cars would be a minimum for 30 units. They're gonna be travel up and down that road. People are already racing since the Wawa come up, I can attest. I sit out there in my backyard and watch them race up and down the road. As with before, they weren't doing it. Now they're doing it. And if we have a 60 more come in that they're gonna be doing it even more. So I suggest decline it. Say no. Thank you, Mister Gilhausen. Misses Gilhausen? Hi. Same address. Do I have to recite it? 82 99. Southwest 100 Lane Road. Darlene Gilhausen. I live in the same house that he just pointed. That was green. On the corner of our property is a stop sign. We have probably eleven children waiting to get on the school bus there. Every morning since the Wawa has been open, we have more traffic. Like what was mentioned previously. Our neighborhood is literally left behind by time. We have children playing football, laser tag, flashlight tag in the roads at nighttime. We won't be able to do this anymore. Thank you, Miss Gilhausen. Do we have anyone else in the audience that wishes to speak? If so, I invite you to come forward. And if there, I saw someone else raise their hand. There are two podiums. So we can just kind of keep it rolling so as a podium opens, if you'd like to speak. I'm going to invite you to come on down without my having to say that again, if you'd like. And that way we'll just kind of roll it a little quicker. Whoever wants to start us. Good afternoon. My name is Lily Smith. My address is ten. 1119 Southwest 84th Avenue Road. Let me emphasize 84th Avenue Road. I have lived there 27 years. I have looked at trees for 27 years. I enjoy the trees and the wildlife that we have there. Excuse me, with them putting the wawa there. As everybody has already stated, the dynamics of our neighborhood has already changed. So if you're going to add 30 units and most families have two cars, so you're adding 60 cars on that one street where we all walk, kids walk, kids play. Everybody said the same thing. So we are asking you to please, please consider our neighborhood. When we bought our homes, we moved into a neighborhood. So when you can add some apartments there, a half a mile, let me see. A half a mile west, there's 100 apartments already being built on 110 Street. 1 mile east, there is another new homes, new apartments, and new townhouses. If you go another half mile, there's also townhomes being built there. The roads were designed for minimal traffic. We have major traffic there already. So you're putting our kids at risk, the neighborhood kids at risk, and our families at risk. Please keep our neighborhood a neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Smith. Christine Goble, 10244 Southwest 82nd Court, Ocala 34481. As residents of this neighborhood in question for over 20 years, we've enjoyed, Darlene got me. We've enjoyed raising our children in a place where they're safe to play outside and explore. And that's the thing that's been very special about living like this. And it's been like that for longer than we've resided there recently. With Wawa, which is next to the site you're proposing, this has been to the demise of our homes and our safety. There are only four exits to leave our residential neighborhood, and the traffic to Wawa is constantly blocking the exit of Southwest Hunter street and State Road 200, making it completely unsafe for our children, our walkers, and our bikers to do any traveling to the McDonald's nearby or even to go to Wawa. It is also now used as a thruway for non residents. So Southwest 100th street is the road that runs right next to Wawa, and it also increased the noise level exponentially. The additional 30 unit apartments or multifamily homes will not only add more traffic to our neighborhood, reducing safety for our walkers, bikers, and children, it will also create more chaos in the front of our neighborhood. By inadvertently making a second through way on 84th Avenue Road, this addition will eliminate a second",

        "text": " agenda so with that I'll Advance the slide I'll try to advance the slide there we go and so three areas that we want to hit today one is just again to give you a look back on gain share to touch briefly how how we got here with game share and some of the information we're going to share with you today is information that you've seen before a couple of years ago it was part of a presentation in March of 21. it was also an update at the time Ms Doyle will talk about the legislative work that's coming up here pretty soon the next month and then we'll talk more about the budget what's being funded out of gameshare and I'll also let you know how much money has been unallocated to this point so sound good could you say how much has been allocated or unallocated both thank you so good morning Board of Commissioners Aaron doyler senior government relations manager and this um slide represents just the overall timeline of what it took to get game share started and how it and when it was changed and I interspersed in that the Strategic investment program agreements that this county has signed as part of the overall Economic Development work that the county has endeavored to undertake but to clarify we are here to talk about gain share but that is intimately tied to the Strategic investment program or sip and I'll just call it sip from here on out because it's a lot faster to say in 1993 the state legislature granted um local governments the ability to enter into sip agreements which are a tax abatement program for significant levels of investment and that tax sits on um after a certain threshold of got property tax above that threshold is abated and we did as a County enter into a number of those sip agreements um two were entered into 1994 one in 1999 2005 2006 each saw additional agreements but during that conversation about is it worth the give there was a realization that there was a lot of income tax revenue coming to the state and we should perhaps share in that game um that we bring to the state when we invest our property tax dollars into Economic Development so in 2007 the state legislature enacted gain share and the the keys there were that the legislature agreed that they would give us about 50 percent of the income tax revenues that were gained for jobs that were either retained as a result of the Sip Investments or new and those were the permanent what we call permanent jobs those are tied to the actual facility themselves that is not related to all the peripheral jobs of any sort of construction trades that come in build and leave um so there were requirements placed on the businesses that they report that information to the state the state manages the assessment uh process as well as the abatement calculations to a large degree that um assessment and Taxation can further explain but it took about three hours for me to get it so I didn't want to add it all here um over the course of the next few years and then one second to clarify that two step 2007 enactment also included a 16 million dollar cap it did not that one that came later okay um that's why I wanted to find out 50 at that point so at that point in time the cap was set at 50 of the new income taxes that were leveled over the course of the next few years as the Sip agreements that were entered in 2005 and 2006 really soft fruition of those new jobs and the retained jobs in particular some people started asking questions and those people happen to be in the state legislature so there was um ongoing work and in 2015 there was an amendment we'll get into that a little bit more um in future slides um and then in 2002 so in 2015 there was a cap placed and a sunset set on the game share portion of the program sips have their own natural Sunset per contract 15 years um so and then in 2022 we sought to extend it six years it was only extended one and now we'll be working to extend it further but to take us and I could I as a clarifying question here so the the gain chair Sunset was not aligned with the Sip Sunset there is no statutory sunset on the Sip program it it has no Sunset each individual sap agreement does does because that's the nature of the concept doesn't have a sense yet correct and so you're saying that gain chair concept had a sunset Dave shares concept had a sunset placed on it in 2015. and do all of our sip agreements stick with that 15-year or are some of them 30-year the 2014 sap agreement is written in such a way that it has a 30-year life but within that there are tranches of what goes into that 15-year abatement period it lasts 30 years so once it was started they had 30 years in which to enact each tranche of the Sip agreement that they wanted to and put as much property into the investment pool and this is um perhaps where you want to have some conversations with the a t or um Greg because I was not part of that contract negotiation team so they have from 2050 so it's to 2045. so the actual abatement and the con the running of the 15 years is once the a portion their investment to that contract so um and I have it in my notes and I will find it as quickly as I can just because so basically the Sip agreement being signed in 2014 did not start the clock on that it didn't start the clock was not started on the 15 years until the Investments That intel was making was allocated to that particular sip agreement so they take they say we're going to invest a billion dollars and until they hit that ability billion dollars Mark in one agreement it doesn't necessarily trigger just because you've signed an agreement it says once we've triggered this agreement through investment that we allocate to that yeah this gets very quickly but the 30-year time frame does start with 2015. the 30th go back to my notes because this is where I don't want to this has never been presented to us which is why we have these questions and that that's fair so which is why I have meetings with technical experts um before I open my mouth um generally I believe the 2014 that was basically the abatement was started in 2017. yeah I think that's my right notes so that 30 years will run from 2017 into 2047. yeah and that three-year 2014 to 2017 the Investments That intel was making at that point in time were allocated to the 2005 sip so in 2000 and the 2005 specific agreement was activated in 2010 so the 15 years for those particular Investments being abated starts in 2010 and runs through they hit their cap in 2017 for the amount that was agreed to which was 25 and then so in 2017 Intel allocated their next set of Investments to the 2014 sip which hit the first um tranche of Investments that they'll be making over 30 years but if their last tranche in that 2014 agreement is anywhere before 15 years before 2047 so math is hard um 2032 they only get the abatement up until 2047 and then all abatements will cease under that 2014 set the premium so you agreed so it sounds to me like the board in 2014 agreed to a 30-year life but the clock for the 30-year life didn't start until Intel activated their Investments for that sip of 2017-20 okay it's very even better no it's better for them it's 30 it's 30 years it's not like Aaron said the the terms for the second 15 are different than the first than the first 50 is so it's kind of a they gave him a 15-year roll out right versus the other ones are much more of a drop dead previous slide if you could go back clarifying uh 1994 IDT integrated device technology I that one has run its course and I don't know anything about that company and then so and in 1999 we did a another Civic agreement with Intel right 20 2005 we did another one 26 2006 we did a gen Attack One um and where so what's the detail on that one where any updates uh I don't have and I make a suggestion um just because we don't have all the information at our fingertips I'll work with staff on bringing a sip update back to the board to provide uh the information and answers to questions you can't talk it's very difficult to talk about one without talking about we're doing it again better before I think we have to accept that they didn't bring us a comprehensive sip overview for today you work in line with the game share today is game share yeah I particularly since it relates to the timeliness for State Legislature and other activities and also to the budget questions yeah I have a game share question now okay not same side if it's this life here yeah so 2007 game share was enacted there was no sunset correct and then 2015 somebody brought a legislative conflict or some way of a bill to suggest the sunset yes and where was Washington County were we in support of that sunset or the the 20 cap yeah I see it the 2015 legislative session was an ongoing negotiation of what could and could not be lived with um I think at the end of the day Washington County wanted to maintain game chair as a program and therefore accepted the terms that the legislature proffered but it was in a very long and complicated negotiation so it's one of um places where I don't believe the County's position was particularly happy with this agreement but it was better than losing the program altogether yes this chart is fairly old it actually um is one that Greg found from prior to the 2015 cap and sun setting and it's really hard to read so but the key takeaways here is what we were expecting as local governments out of Sip and gain share was that that red line is the property tax that's abated so our revenue losses and then the green bar chart above shows what we were expecting to gain",

        "text": " about this a little bit um I'll just go ahead and and split this we um soorry we the DPO did recommend a new site certific conditions um requiring compliance with the Wildfire mitigation plan attached to the DPO during construction um the conditions then require finalization of the operational portion of the plan prior to beginning um uh based on kind of the comments that we received in the feedback we are we are at the point where we do think additional work is needed prior to construction so we will be looking to that um and our primary recommendations are really regarding coordination with the local fire service providers and I having more specific plans about how to respond but um we're looking for your feedback on that well as well um so if I could the next slide please um so these were the comments that were raised on the record um uh so commenters uh identified uh F of specificity for procedures standards and time frames for inspections and vegetation management during the operational feed uh phase of the project uh lack of Provisions for routine anchor bolt inspections lack of Provisions to to address hazard from lightning strikes and monitoring during lightning events um inadequate consideration of fire spread potential during high wind events potential impacts of residen is agricultural buildings and equipment cropland and cropland soils uh and then inadequate coordination with local fire service providers um I'll provide a little bit of uh of background and and show the fire map and then we can talk about these kind of one by one um so if I could get the next slide um thank you um so this is the fire map we were discussing earlier um I think we've gone over it a lot but I just kind of wanted to show um again how we discussed the prop land areas um do show up as lower risk partly because of the fuel modeling um that goes into this model whereas the more hilly areas show a higher likelihood that a fire that occurred in those areas would be severe and be harder to control um uh this model is a hazard to potential structures so it's not saying the risk to things that are actually on the landscape it's saying if a fire occurred in a started in a pixel how damaging would it be to or how how what's the potential for serious damage to a structure within a certain radius and I I won't give that specific radius uh because I I don't remember what it is but um but it is basically it's meant to approximate how quickly will something spread out of control if it starts in one of these things so um a lot of the areas uh in the more I guess rugged portions of the site the portion to the south of butter Creek um are considered to be moderate to high in their fire risk and you can see there's some very high um portions modeled in there um so we do think that overall um there is moderate to high risk at the site of of a fire becoming uncontrolled if it's not adequately contained um in these new micro sighting areas um those are not the areas where most structures or uh prop lands are um so again I'll just clarify and we can do our best to clarify this in the record that um those this isn't really a reflection of the hazard it's it's the risk um at the say so that makes sense even though this is this why this says Hazard um there's any questions about the map we can talk about it a little more I know we talked about this a lot and what the data is already so um there's no other questions we could move okay not about the map but about um the risk and um incorporating um you know the wind factor right and how you know we're just looking at this site but in reality um the wind can carry Embers miles and we've seen that in Oregon recently so just wanted to point that out as we work through this thank you all thank you council member I'm um one and one of the things that we see as potentially lacking in the Wildfire plan is identification of both natural fire brakes and in places where um the certificate holder would maintain fire brakes uh kind of permanently and then where uh fire lines and other fire suppression activities would be concentrated if there were uh a fire in one of these zones um there are some natural fire breaks in the site the Butter Creek and little Butter Creek and those Associated roads uh do provide somewhat of a defensible space Break um you know so so there is some indication that if a fire were to occur in portions of the site you know it would at least be containable and that we we didn't get that data though from the certificate holder and it hasn't been vetted so that that's something that we think needs to be developed more fully um in the final plan again I just want to reiterate I live in this area and so I'm pretty familiar with fires in the area in fact we had one last summer right in my town and um there was a road barrier present but that didn't stop the fire from crossing the road um there's even Creeks you know like butter Creek that will have winter uh winter runoff in it but then come a month or two later depending on the weather that year it's dry so just want to have those factors considered into the discussion um just how easily it can jump um also we had the Cascade the lock fire a few years ago and we had the Columbia River right there it's a huge body of water and it jumped the river and went over to bonnaville so just want to make sure that we're thinking that out a big Vision like how this really does happen in Oregan With the Wind thank you thank you coun Prim um to continue with the next slide yeah I guess I'll just respond to say I I am not downplaying the risk of fire at the site at all I do think that um council members I'm that right that you know fire risk is is a very serious issue with this facility um and with all energy facilities in general there have been energy like wind turbine related fires in the area um there's grass fires associated with birds hitting power lines um so it does happen it's it's not uh we're not we're not trying to downplay that and hope that the certificate holder is also hearing the level of concern um as um we got a a number of comments about the operational aspects of the pH facility and what they would do to vegetation uh and inspect components to to ensure that the components themselves aren't proposing a um ignition risk um the certificate holder did provide the revised plan that had this table in it this information kind of explaining what their inspection schedule would look like um I uh it provides for for visual inspections of most components uh at least on a quarterly basis uh with some uh inspected annually there's a more detailed list of this in the plan itself um and they would be doing annual inspections to ensure compliance with the Aven power line interaction recommendations um and that's specifically inspecting the transmission line compon components to ensure that um the protections to prevent Avan electrocutions are in place uh and then they would be doing inspections to ensure that the clearances are maintained and gravel pads are are uh free vegetation and that defensible spaces are maintained um you know on this more annual basis I guess um I'm probably not able to speak to the ACT ual standards and manufacturers recommendations in detail but if there are any questions on this we can discuss yeah um I think that's good that there's some time frames here I would think that vegetation in particular those would be be preventative so we would do the those they don't specify what time of year here is that correct I'd have to go back and look recollection is that the inspections and a annual vegetation management plan as far as where they're going to do spraying and mowing for this stuff would be prepared before the Fire season each year um but sure that the county weed person that's the expert here has given that input as to when they would like to see these things done um because you know the council's presented with a pretty high um understanding of that so just wanted to make sure that that collaboration was happening I believe that the weed supervisor is more directly involved with the weed treatments and the weed eradication program but as far as things as like what section of the transmission line needs to be mowed or when trimming needs to occur to maintain the 5 foot clearances from the transmission lines is is kind of a separate issue well I'm just talking about when they're doing it when they're performing the inspection and when they're you know that's that's the only thing I and I don't want to get too far into this I understand this is this is out of my wheelhouse but um as long as it's being done at the appropriate time yeah and and I do believe that before the Fire season and making sure that the trimming is done before the Fire season is the right time um again I'm little over my skis and I can pull up the plan itself if that'd be helpful but um just want to make sure that the coordination and collaboration happening that's that's where this is my question is more geared towards so you um if I could get the next slide um yeah similarly this just kind of lists the the particular vegetation management standards um I do want to point out that um I believe the ion rural Fire Protection District uh requested a 100 foot defensible space around structures and that would include um the substation control build bu and I think the battery site uh itself which they're kind of on a combined site um and we did uh request that be included in a condition uh and I don't think that particular setback distance showed up in the the management plan so I think that would exceed um that defensible space would exceed these standards otherwise the standards are based kind of on the engineering details and the likelihood of um aring based on the voltage of the equipment and that's beyond my particular knowledge set um uh so otherwise these are the standards that would apply it's the international um Institute of electrical engineers uh standards the National Electric committee standards and the um which are I think also adopted by the National Fire Protection Association and then the National Electric reliability Corporation standards um a lot of acronyms a lot of acronyms and I uh yeah please please don't ask me to explain what's what's in that um right next slide um so to kind of go through the issues um uh we heard concerns about hazard from lightning and uh both I think the hazard from lightning striking turbines and the",

        "text": ", excuse me? Address now, please. Didn't I give it? Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was focusing on that item. Okay. The. I see. We're going to spend some money on development of this animal shelter. I'm just hoping that we build it in such a way that it will serve more than five years, maybe ten to 20 years, and hopefully become a center of very shiny progress, of how things can be done. Even though you know that I think after a while the animal must go on to heaven. But other than that, if you're going to do this, do it right. Do it right. Let's not half step it. Let's do it right and get it done in such a way that in the future we can say, okay, this was well spent. Yes, sir. Mister Munoz, I promise this board is fully dialed in with admin and all those who are designing this facility for a long term, better opportunity. So thank you for your comments this morning. You're welcome. Is there anyone else in the audience for public comment with an agenda item? If not, if you have anything else you'd like to address the board on, please hang around a little bit longer and you'll have that opportunity to come back. So that is going to take us now into our consent items, and I'm going to start on my left this morning. If there is anything that needs to be pulled. Madam chair, I think we need to back up to 5.1 and four. Sorry. Thank you. I turned the page and kept on rolling. Three and actually, the minutes. Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Bryant. I am so grateful for those who keep me on tap. So let's go back into item number three to adopt the minutes. We do have two sets of minutes. August 1 and August 11 of 2023. So moved. Second got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner McLean. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. And for those who are listening and you don't hear voices, a silence is a yes vote. Just for your own information, we do not have any constitutional officers and government outside agencies. So, mister clerk, I am sorry that I tried to leave out your top. Not at all, madam Chair. Thank you. And I apologize to the board. I'll try to figure out what happened with Mister Gooding's submission, but I appreciate Mister Straub finishing clearing that up. I also just briefly, would like to thank Miss Tart, if I may, and her team for acknowledging Mister Reynolds at the courthouse. He is fantastic. Employee of the quarter, employee of the year, employee of the decade, whatever you want to call him, he has earned it. I don't know that I've ever met a more decent and hardworking individual in my life. I would say I wish I could have said this to his face, but I'll tell him later. You know, if my kids can grow up to be and work like him and act like him to any and everybody, I will have succeeded as a parent. So well done and acknowledging him have for the board's consideration and adoption today, budget amendment resolution items 511 through 518. I would point out that item 516 relates to consent agenda items 752. Madam chair? Yes? If no one on the board has any intentions of pulling 752, I'll go ahead and move it up to be approved with 511 through 518. Thank you. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, including 511 through 518 and 752, with a second by Commissioner Curry. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, madam chair. Next. Item 5.2 relates to the disposition or transfer of property, includes miscellaneous Marion county fire rescue equipment, radio, miscellaneous office equipment, and transfer of vehicles. Thank you, Mister Clerk. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner McLean. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Okay, that now will take us to our consent items. And so I will start with Commissioner McLean. Do you have anything for consent to be pulled? No, ma'am, not today. Missionary curry. Really? Not to be pulled, but 711, just for clarification, you're going to clarify that? I'm gonna pull it. Okay. Okay. Commissioner Zalick, do you have anything. Yeah, I did want to talk about the animal stuff, so what are that? 749. 749 and Commissioner Bryant. Good. Okay. Yes. Mister Boyones? Yes, madam chair? I would like to pull item 711 and item 744 for two totally different reasons. 711, I think the agreement is in a form to be approved, but we still have some questions regarding the operation of that facility. And 744, we still have a lot of discussion to have with staff and with the consultant, and we will bring you back a. Probably a revised agreement in the future that may encompass a different scope. Very good. So 711 is being pulled. And 744 is being pulled. They are not in for consideration this morning. And 749. And 749 has been pulled for consideration, so. And 752 has already been passed? 752 has already been passed. I'll move the balance. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by commissioner Zalick to move the balance. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Commissioner zalik? 749. All right. Can I make just a comment on a piece of this? Obviously, I didn't want to pull it, but I did talk with Chief Graff yesterday. There are a few things that are. That are battery powered in the fire rescue piece. You know, there are some of those things that are going to. That they are ridiculously expensive, you know, and I mean, almost absurd in some cases. So I appreciate. I talked to chief Graff. One of my concerns were that we're going to start trying to equip everything with this. And he was assured me that we're going to do it for technical rescue for a couple ladders. Have a few of them in the field as far as that, in case they get far off the road. But he is talking about 7410. I was just going to ask, can you clear seven, four nine? No, I said pull it. But I just said, just for a moment, I wanted to talk about this item. I didn't want to pull it. I just. I just wanted to clarify. So wait a minute. Did. We've already approved. Okay, so 7410 did get approved. I just wanted to talk about. Thank you. I'm sorry. I want to make clarification that we're not trying to outfit the whole fire department with those types of tools quite yet because we don't know if they really work. We're testing them and all those kind of things. Yes. And they are incredibly expensive. I understand why our team wants to have some of them, but I also don't want to go away with some of the traditional things that we know work day in and day out. So, anyway, thank you, Chief Graff. I just wanted to give you a shout out. I appreciate it. On 749 commissioners. I'm going to vote to approve this and all those kind of things. I just want to continue to talk to our team and our staff. It makes a difference. This board has told everyone before when our owners and our team are local, when our, when we spend our sales tax money and we spend the money of Marion county, our people want it to be with local teams. And, you know, we have this job. We got another one coming up in medical examiner. We got another one up in facilities. I don't want to be batting zero for three when our teams are capable. Just want to put that out there. Make sure that our county administrator educate, continues to educate our team and our selection committees about the power of having local teams do our work because they live here, they eat here, they pay the sales tax, they do all those things. Make sure our business is kept there. Thank you. Okay. Do we have any other comments about 749? Yes. Susan may want to address this, but in a meeting I had with her yesterday, you know, the extra points that local folks get now goes all the way through the system. Yes. We just used to only be the first part of. So. That's correct. You said it. Well, yeah, that's exactly right. We still, it seemed like there could be some discussion about possibly increasing the points for local businesses. Yes, but that's something to be determined. Well, and if the board wants to set some sort of percentage, Susan, that's the discussion. Commissioner, I will have with procurement, and we will deal with it appropriately. I don't need to. I just was kind of addressing it watered down. Commissioner, my whole point is this, is that, listen, we all know that there are people that are hired. Right. May not be the case in this particular situation. Right. But to do a great, what you would call a dog and pony show, and our people on these selection committees have to dig down because this is not about the best presentation, the best person with words, the best person with that. It's about the best person to build a product for Marion county in the long term. Right. And",

Salem Kaiser and NAACP and Salem Kaiser collaboration meetings in December after the application period was closed staff reviewed the proposals to determine if the proposed activities were eligible based on the federal funding guidelines applications were forwarded to a group of panelists comprised of Salem citizens and persons with knowledge of the Salem's homeless population needs for the review and staff then rank the applications based upon the total scores funding recommendations are based on those recommen on those rankings recommendations are outlined in the draft annual action plan which was publicly noticed and transmuted to Partners these are the approximate award amounts HUD has not released the federal funding as of today's date how will the proposed funding be used the proposed projects will provide various types of assistance to approximately 25,000 individuals and families within Salem these projects are designed to assist low to moderate C citizens with economic and social and housing needs the city will contract with the applicants once the Department of Housing and Urban Development and submit Federal funding agreements and they're duly executed by our city manager Federal Regulations also require the city to conduct an environmental review of each activity to determine whether a project may have an impact on environment the approximate Federal funding available to award includes annual entitlement program income for loans previously funded project cost savings and unallocated resources from previous years the total available resources are used to

Roy mlan I'm with WestCare our DBA is vetare here in Salem but we're the WestCare Foundation um we run a GPD 501c3 nonprofit for veterans uh uh we house 30 homeless veterans and we've provide program wraparound programs to get them back to self-sufficiency and I wanted to just get up here and thank the council members I think we're in zone six and uh uh your consideration for the funding um just to put it in perspective there's only two gpds in the Marian pulk Linn bitton and Lincoln counties there's the Tanner project with mid lit Valley Community Action Agency and there's vetare of those two agencies only can house 30 veterans per facility so you can understand the magnitude of um just in the five counties how many veterans are out there that aren't being taken off the street indoor programs so I just wanted to get up here and say thank you for your consideration it's really really needed um this is for the safe and sanitary uh transitional housing for the veterans at my facility um our upgrades are outdated our our our facility is old so these fundings will go towards new HVAC um we have a full kitchen so we need new evaporat and condensers for the walk-in frers and freezers and uh new energy efficient Windows if I could ask for more for other things that I have going on I'll be here next year as well um so I'm not a very good speaker but um I just want to get up here and

I'll try to phrase it into question like a Jeopardy uh so you mentioned like imagine uh you know what it's like and I you know my day job is I'm an emergency room doctor so I don't have to imagine uh I care for people in our community who are houseless or unsheltered every day and I would say a substantial proportion of them have served our country so in the military so I I just want to say thank you for the work and partnership you're doing in our community uh it absolutely saves lives um I guess uh I bought myself enough time to phrase this as a question you mentioned uh that you could do more and um you don't have to go into gory details but I would really like to hear what we could do to be more effective in supporting you in your mission to house uh more people who served our country uh just initial funding when we come when we come to it I have a a $1.5 million Capital Grant from the VA that I'm sitting on that I can't utilize um things happened and transpired where I share my building with another with mid Lama Valley actually and uh things happened to where we ended up not being able to acquire that side of the building so now I can't use that 1.5 and 1.5 is not enough to go out and find another building purchase it get a kitchen upgrade so I have to send that money back to the VA so I'm not I'm not happy about that so um if I can come and sit here and I think I owe it to you to come here since you're considering a $400,000 Grand amount and I appreciate that so I wanted to be here for that and uh I'll just I I need more and I'll I'll be coming back so I I just appreciate that I'm just to give you an idea too that you know I wrote down some stuff since I just got on to being director uh for the GPD here in June and uh from 20122 to now as far as uh percent of veterans didn't discharge of permanent housing and fy22 it was 56.4 one% and FY 23 it was 80% and FY 24 to date 70% and it's it's just increasing more and more our wraparound Services we're not just providing housing without programs we have the staff sergeant Fox suicide prevents program that we get from the VA we have the uh uh homeless veterans reintegration program which is an employment agency we get from the VA or from the Department of Labor I'm sorry and then we have our after Care Program which follows veterans 6 months after they get into permanent housing so they don't have recidivism back to homelessness so it's not we're just from we're not just providing housing and saying here you go and it just that sets up sets up for failure so I wanted to give you those stats a little bit just to let you know we have those wraparound Services we're trying to do the best we can but the VA is pretty tight as well so I just really appreciate your time and your consideration and it's it's really needed so thank you thank you very much thank you thank you next up next up is Jackie Le Young hi everybody R Lim that stands for hello in Chukis my name is Jackie L I am a resident of Ward 4 and um the mic micronesian Islander Community office is currently in W two did is this work okay and and our future build will be in Ward one on the corner of Grove and um

Asian-American Pacific Islander housing Advocates develop a 41 affordable housing units for our community um the majority of the units are um two bedrooms we have 25 two-bedroom units 13 that will be three-bedroom and three that will be one-bedroom another key piece that we are really excited about is also the building of the First Community Center for four micronesians here on the continental US the only other two builds or buildings specifically that are cultural specific for micronesians is in Hawaii and in Guam otherwise it'll be the first one in general um in over in this side of the us

        "text": " involved to you know read division 15 thoroughly and there's been some kind of maybe some some some clarity uh identified that we could in um add to that uh Division and so this rulemaking project would make recommendations on how to improve that Clarity and consistency with the attorney general's model rules and so things could include like the process for appointed hearing officers requirements for preservative standing and raising issues which is always a big deal for these things and the availability and use of procedure emotions so you know this is like nuts and bolts for making sure that this contested process which by nature is contested uh at least everyone knows the rules of the game uh and there's not fights about the fight um and uh yeah so this this one is a priority given the recent uh b2h contested case proceeding and a lot of a lot of lessons were learned and uh there's definitely in my discussions with the rest of Staff uh some a lot of motivation to take the lessons we've learned while there's still fresh in our minds and do a rulemaking to apply those lessons to make this a better a better rule with regard to intested cases next slide enough oh yeah this can't this would involve Iraq or yes all of these four would yeah these are all going to be significant rule makings so yeah uh the fourth one here is the site certificate Amendment rulemaking which was actually initiated by Council on October 28th uh 2022 uh and for to develop proposed revisions to the rules governing the expiration Amendment and discrimination of certificates under oer uh chapter 345 division 27. so we've already initiated this but again like with the the first you know substantive one uh it's just a matter of priorities but when we want to tackle this one so uh this rulemaking is is a priority given the number of amendments that we get especially relative to Applications uh and also we're about to get some feedback uh by the end of this year well we already we didn't proceed in that feedback yeah uh uh regarding the changes that were made uh in 2017 and then in 2020 so with this I mean if we're gonna have to review that we might as well review that and then incorporate into a um so that makes 2023 an ideal time to take this so between the contested case the the amendment and the the process review there's we're really 2023 is really going to be I mean what we're recommending is kind of like taking a holistic kind of review and really tackling some meaty stuff with respect to rulemaking and trying to you know make this process we can't there's a lot of things we can't control but we can ensure that at least our part of it is as smooth as we can make it um so next slide so here we go here are the four uh with the one that we're recommending we for sure start the year with and then uh one of the other three uh we would ask that Council would select one of those assuming you're okay with this proposal uh just to start the year with with the remaining two being worked on towards the end of the year girl yeah and just to remind people um you know starting in January we're initiating the long-lived sleep session so many people that we're going to want on the rule making advisory committee are also probably going to be involved in the legislative session as well so I would expect for the first half of the year not that we should prolong any of these will make things I think you should whatever that your choice is for our priority absolutely do that but it also may be a little bit difficult for us to convene you know rule making advisory committees uh because of just um the nature of a long legislative session the amount of work so recognizing we will you know move forward we'll do our best time frames may be a little bit longer than they would be in the second half of 2023 or in 2024 again just because of the participation in the legislative session and the capital is still in the survey is able to have a double of its time trying trying to gather folks and tempers are going to quickly flare so that is a good point and I am not crying I haven't realized both my scope this is all very emotional for me too and I do apologize for stopping uh stepping out so I would recommend that you know we clearly start with the application process of Phase One to begin with recognizing Todd's comment it's kind of our process that's where we begin on the processing applications but as a part of that um frequently now we have the contested case process and I really think that that should be number two and then number three should be the amendment process and I think that's the flow of how we deal with applications now and um and then that by its nature puts historical cultural and archaeological resources is formed and I think that provides a process that also adheres to our review process of site certificate applications I appreciate the way you presented that this is Marcy and the reason being I do not want anyone to think that we don't value historic culture and archaeological resources but with that said if we don't get a handle on the contested case thing we're never going to drop perception and be able to point to so I personally concur family yeah now I I do as well I um especially with the uh experience of b2h and the record that's been built there to roll with that and get that going knowing that you can do the application process session doing its videos are there the site certificate Amendment my only concern there is that we've sort of kicked that process off but nobody's like banging down the door right so so I think the order that's presented and you know Steph has done a great job um interacting with uh tribal Nations as as applications coming in and that work to continue and and the interest in tribes can hopefully help scope what that effort would look like so that we don't end up in the two-year protected area kind of discussion I also wonder on that element for the state historic protection our office has been so understaffed and and just trying to figure out what role what they've probably been understaffed for many many years but trying to figure out their roles so I'm 100 amazing academies recommendation but that it's all important right may we ask uh Patrick because you have lots of things that we may work for you obviously does that work with your world just that'd be great if we could we could clean this rule so yeah then do you have any comments um no uh that's final this is a little bit of a facetious comment I think but I'm kind of wondering where the organizational expertise conversation is going to come in for a rural for world making because I'm hoping to still be on the council but oh well let's let's uh let's finish this discussion we can uh yeah we can maybe maybe we'll get to that I don't know we'll see I think it's in the application process well it's a new somewhere well uh so for 2024 we currently have just four uh forecasted for now uh since these tend to spill over uh and certainly those other two that we're going to start at the end of the year are almost certainly going to go go into 24 24. so we don't want to overbook 2024 and then all that gets pushed into 2025 so we just have the four here uh and starting with uh the 212 which would be phase two and this would be uh where we would start to make some substantive changes uh but mainly from a kind of a gap analysis where we're we want to make ensure that we have kind of a one-to-one relationship between what the standard says that the applicant has to show and what the application process actually asks the applicant to provide so to the extent that those currently don't match up and we're asking for things that they don't actually have to you know please give us this and then it doesn't actually help prove anything that they you know for a standard that they'd have to meet uh that's not good so that's kind of what this phase two is going to be envisions and that's going to involve either filling some holes or deleting some stuff where it's like why are we asking for this um yeah I think that's this is handling I think it fits in phase two yeah right yeah really and there's a gap yeah so uh then we have uh r185 uh which would evaluate several outstanding policy questions related to exemptions including weather Council May impose conditions on an exemption ongoing monitoring the reporting require requirements for exempt facilities and the process for the loss of an exemption uh our our 182 was approved back in 2018 but is another one of those that just keeps getting bumped uh as other things kind of come up and is now being bought to 2024 um you know this this little making would focus on improving Clarity and consistency of construction and operation requirements and providing additional specificity for monitoring and Reporting requirements and time frames and then 20 uh 221 here would evaluate issues related to the financial assurance and requirements a retirement standard under uh division 50 and the other roles related to development maintenance and use of financial Assurance instruments so I know at least some people on the council are interested in that one I think we all are yeah I mean it's it's probably everyone's ever won but uh yes that's where the home currently sits uh so then let's move to 20 next slide uh 2025 we have several projects that are still kind of an early phases of development including phase three of the application process review uh which this is probably where um Verde would be the most interested uh because this was kind of envisioned as the the phase where we examine the possibility of adjusting the rules depending on the types of energy facilities this was envisioned before you know the state directed us to you know go all renewable uh but is so it's kind of more relevant than it was even when we envisioned it but um yes so that's phase three and then we have uh oh sure go for it so what sitting there right now so what this problem is something well we have to accelerate and modify anything for her so possibly it depends on what comes out of the session so you know in the past there have been you know mandatory changes you know two rules um some of those were either mandated to make those changes quickly and if that's the case then we would reset you know",

        "text": " to you know me I don't want to overcommit and under deliver um but I do support the efforts that the legislature is working um so um my question is do we also need to sign on to that in addition to providing our own letter it is my understanding that the legislature would like to see those letters of commitment it is commitment to apply for funding I want to be really clear about that um there are letters on the packet including that one I did eventually I think it's both in the online materials I don't know what page on the PDF yet um but I shared with you that did come from our district attorney our Sheriff oh it's it's the document right before perfect so uh I just want to make sure that the letter from US does stand out that yes this is our letter of commitment with all the caveats if there are any on our own letter okay and if in addition if our letter is also following on to this other letter the one titled letter of commitment then I'm if if you tell me that they're consistent then I'm comfortable as one of five towards that uh on that so that's my starting point other Commissioners I I have a question about the about the letter um it's it's the last sentence of the second to the last paragraph through through the final paragraph and I'm just not I I'm asking my fellow Commissioners are we comfortable that that's a strong enough statement about funding which page and which second the letter of commitment is that the one you're referring to or sorry the the letter from us the letter from chair Harington yes okay thank you on which page and which second page got it so PDF page 27 yes the paragraph close to the bottom that starts we are committed to continuing the work we have done we've been doing to increase access to Services right and then the third sentence starts with we need investments from the state legislature to cover the costs of these two programs and then F the the concept of covering costs and funding follows through to that next paragraph and closing paragraph the question I'm raising is is that a strong enough statement or do we or should we be using conceptually the unfunded mandate type of approach here and our concern about whether or not there'll be enough funding to meet the needs that are created well I think we need Investments is pretty clear I'm you know we can ask them to bold it well yes we can highlight that as a key message through formatting happy to do that you want to quantify or no I don't think we can quantify it but I'm thinking something like we need your commitment for investments from legisl do your investment in this work will make our work possible and we could I'm fine if you're saying your investment in this work is vital and necessary exactly make our work that's my that's my point didn't feel quite strong enough to me without it that exactly without your full investment we we opt out yeah without your full investment okay thank you yeah I have a just a I feel like it's worth pointing out that um the speaker's office when they were sharing this kind of draft letter of commitment and trying to collect these letters they did emphasize that they said this language was carefully negotiated with law enforcement and they want to be really careful and so I think we should be mindful of making changes to the letter I just want to make sure you this is our letter this is our letter that we're talking about just wanted to make sure you're aware we're on pages 26 and 27 so this is our testimony oh my my apologies I thought you were talking about the letter of no Willie by and Rogers uh the only thing that um that I agree with is Roy's comment this is very complex um I would like to see a little bit more of information of what we are asking have a financial snapshot of what we are asking the state to fun so I don't know what that number is I've heard a lot of different numbers in here and different variations and so just it's just one liner just this is what we think the state would have to provide so that we are fully funded this and I like the changes that YouTu made on that letter I thought that was really good too I needed to be strong so just yeah what are we looking at we we will look to provide that information about what we think the fal impacts of creating a deflection program is to the board um in followup and um make the language of this letter stronger but not specific I don't want to tie us to a number if we could get more thenk the second thing that I heard you talking about was because the opt out program when they sto funding at two years now or they significantly reduce funding those kinds of things we got to have an opap yep okay future B bium will directly impact our ability to provide this the continue providing this the deflection services and diversion there there is a space in the letter where I can add that information where I talk about we've seen commitments that Flatline and we can't live with them so I'll make that language clearer about future commitments I do see that you do reference as we're working to build the cat what I got out of your presentation is that the current package is looking to provide funding for cat and then these other Outreach ones but I'm not sure that the letter clearly articulates okay so I'm just saying I can't make that evaluation now but that is one of the parts that I heard commissioner Willie yeah you know it's it's relative to our understanding as of this date so however you choose to site all of that okay yeah we can add that in good we got two minutes uh I'll be um I I like your letter way better than the letter that was being circulated and I and I appreciate probid in the context that that was negotiated words on that page it makes sense now but so I appreciate what you have and I'm happy to um give you my thumbs up I know you said you don't want a a word Smith but I'm not sure there's a sentence that says this meets our this das24 amendment meets our goal for Creer collaboration I think this -24 Amendment attempts to actually do that I'm not sure if it's going to do that myself but um you're the one that's out there and living and grieving this 127 page documents that proposal so where are you I don't see there I'm in the third paragraph which page page first page 26 so it CES the das24 yeah it says the dash4 this meets our goal for greater collaboration um but I'm not going to wor meth eron I heard you loud and clear but I I don't fully support that this does actually meets our goal it does attempt uh but um soft that language to say this steps towards meeting our goal thank you and I'm perfectly happy with our letter stating standing on its own in terms this serving as our letter okay yeah yeah and I because I think a ba Barton and the rest that letter is on the record and yes yeah good point thanks commissioner Rogers I was quickly have problems with anything is rushed I understand you work in that environment but usually bad business usually as far as the letter I like the provisions about strengthening that fa I like again because I brought up we have to have an OP out without an OP out if there sufficient funding drops we have a problem um the rest of it's okay I I just have one question here we are the afteron on this day and by six o'clock tonight there may be a whole different set of Provisions you know that and I know that so if we send this and there are additional changes between now and what happens tomorrow the next day or the next day what is your attempts to come back and I don't think you can get this whole board maybe just go to the chair and try so a letter of testimony can be only submitted when there is a public hearing open which is what we have this 48 hours for any further changes that require further comment by the county would have to be done directly through your lobby team that's what Pablo and zacher are down there for and and Carly too who's also there um to make sure that we're completely covered and we would work through the systems of any additional changes through both AOC and through direct conversations with Senator lever and others we're being very clear that our latest and greatest is-33 which is that's all we see any changes don't necessarily agre y i justed mandate is my big concern and yep okay we're fine okay thank you all for your time attention on this rapidly happening and a very complex matter and I'd like to just give a shout out to our team for how diligent they have been over the last five days with re iteration good job as well as everyone else that supports Us in this work across the county in a very one Washington County approach excellent thank you thank you very much thank you go okay well we are going to shift GE Now entirely towards our land use and transportation and Community planning and invite a significant team up with Roberts as the conductor uh on the Sherwood West sunet plan so if you could start by introducing everyone and then take us into the topic absolutely thank you chair and Commissioners um I'm pleased today to I'm really going to just turn this over to the team from Sherwood they're going to walk you through the Sherwood West concept plan for a proposed ggb expansion and so I want to give them the stage to do that but I'll just real quickly introduce who we have with us today so we're joined by Eric R is the community development director for the city of Sherwood mayor Tim Rosner of course um Joy Chang is the planning manager interim planning manager and a former Lut employee yes good to see you again yeah and thank you for continuing to serve of jurisdiction here in Washington County yeah exactly yeah glad to have her here and U so really I'm just here to set the stage a little bit so they're just going to walk us through the concept plan the purpose for the briefing today really is just to ensure that you have some visibility into this the city will be making a formal request we believe for a uh ugb expansion in April and then um one of the actions for your board would be to consider formally acknowledging the city study and then at some point we would be asked to provide a letter support of the ugb expansion as the transportation system provider for the area with that I'll",

        "text": " kind of the same thing as rfa1 except a lot more stuff um so this these are kind of the the big highlevel things that are included that the certificate holder is requesting Council review and approve for the facility so and it includes a redefinition of the site boundary and micro sighting areas um and then also expanding the site boundary and I'm going to try to walk through that because this is conceptually it's a little bit hard so I'm going to kind of walk walk Council through that um and folks in in the room that are here to provide their testimony so and then similar to RFA 1 they're also adding uh additional micro sighting areas so additional route changes for the transmission line and for roads um and then they're also proposing to add in uh a midline capacitor station um within the already approved site boundary in Union County increase the width of temporary construction roads and then amend language to site certificate conditions so this is like the how my um presentation is structured I'm basically going to kind of touch on each of these and tell you kind of where the DPO we talked about it the most so the scope of council's review for amendments kind of differs based on what type of amendment uh council's looking at so your scope of review is a little bit different if it was an amendment that is extending construction deadlines so because this amendment has several aspects to it these are the questions that Council the questions I always refer to them as the questions these are the questions that you're answering or asking ourselves or same ases the certificate holder demonstrate this so does the portion added to the site boundary comply with the laws and standards um that would apply to an to an application for every amendment council's required to take a look at the bonder or letter in credit and see if it is adequate if the amount is adequate and then is does the facility with these changes comply to the laws that protect a resource or interest that could be affected by the change okay all right okay so here's here's this is kind of a heavy one there's lots of words on here so this is the redefinition um of the site boundary and the micro sighting area which is that which is also included with expanding the site boundary and I have a bullet there it is there little last one okay so and I have some maps I'm going to go over this with words and then I have some maps we're going to stare at to to help because I'm a visual person and I suspect that other people are too so back at the ASC in RFA one the site boundary was equivalent to the micro sighting area which means that and and for most of the transmission line that was 500 feet so that meant that that all that 500 feet is where the trans the final transmission line would go and all of that area was surveyed so that the certificate holder could then move or micro site the final right away which is about 2 to 300 ft anywhere within that 500 ft so site boundary equal micro sighting area part of RFA 2 they're saying we're going to separate those definitions and this is very typical of what council may see with other energy facilities like a wind facility which might have a 40,000 Acre Site boundary but your actual the micro sighting area where they're actually going to put facility components might be you know 4,000 Acres or something totally just making up numbers here um and there's various reasons for that but that's that we we see this comment this is not a a unique thing um however you know because we're kind of we've done we've gone to this point with the application and definition this way and now we're kind of separating it it adds to kind of some confusion so so separating those definitions um and then they're saying we're going to expand the site foundary out to a half a mile for most of the facility not everywhere which means this is just an expanded area that is evaluated for potential resources and then within that area are those micro sighting areas that are 500 ft to move to move around that final transmission line that would be 200 to 300 feet right away so and so that site boundary again that c is is not it would not if not be an approval to locate any facility components there the facility components only get located in those micro sighting areas the site boundary is a bigger area that's evaluated for resources and it has other has a Nexus with um other process steps um in the council's process so we're this is like kind of we're in definitions and terminology um so that's so we'll we'll look at it so micro sighting Corridor means this is the this is where facility components would be located it within the micro sighting Corridor that's also the area that we would be required to do all the necessary surveys where an expanded site boundary area we're not really we're not locating anything there so we are satisfied with like a desktop evaluation for resources in that area and then so and and Council traditionally permits flexibility within a micro sighting Corridor if a certificate holder an applicant demonstrate that all the requirements have been met for that area um and then I have this Council doesn't and this is we have a write up it's in the general standard of review section in the DPO for this um it is interesting when you look at it because most um you know projects or facilities that come in front of council typically say this is our site foundary this is our micro sighting area and we just and that's we look at it and we evaluate and we talk about it but it's interesting because it doesn't really have a standard right so a standard that we would be looking at to then say well do they meet it or not for this request so really this request is and like our recommendation in the order is whether or not they've provided the information to demonstrate that they can apply those definitions that way and we recommend that they do because this is basically an information requirement it do the prance demonstrate that they've provided the information to characterize the site boundary and to characterize and Survey those micro areas um okay so let's see what what what does this mean what does this again um map is not super huge it doesn't really need to be we don't need to see the details this is a map from the ASC from the application this is where the site boundary equal the micro sighting area and uh well actually this is on bombing range road so it's probably a little bit more narrow but let's say this was like 500 feet okay and so now is this is the same area the gray area right here can you see my there's my mouse it's not great I wish I had a laser the gray area along this is that previously approved what we would call now micro sighting area okay that's the approved site boundary and we would say this that's the previously approved micro sighting area and this big line over here is the expanded site boundary so that is the half here this is a good they're only proposing to expand the site boundary half a mile on one side they are not proposing to expand the site boundary onto onto the Navy property so here you don't see it going out a half mile over there so and then part of this map too we also have so this is a map that shows you the expanded site boundary the previously approved now you know micro sighting Corridor in that site boundary and it also shows you these are some rfa2 um micro sighting area additions or their little road segments we can see that they're just Minor Road changes so that this was an easy one so now we're going to kick it up a notch here over here here's a map where from the ASC where the um site boundary equal micro sighting area and here this is a little segment of the Morgan Lake alternative that's what's right here this is the Morgan Lake alternative site boundary equals micro sighting Corridor and so here the um our orientation is a little bit different here okay but and there's a lot going on here so this this this is kind of confusing if you're if you're looking at it you're like you kind of have to stare at the legend and stare at the map for a while to kind of pars through what's going on so here in RFA 2 they're proposing a couple Alternatives so this is the rock Rock Creek Alternatives and these are basically alternatives for them to pick where to move where to transition the ASC approved route down into the Morgan Lake alternative so these are they're giving you a couple options but then so these are micro sighting area additions and then the yellow line is the expanded site boundary so if approved no facil facility components are going to go out here right here right wait hold for my mouse right there no facility components no roads no transmission towers go in that expanded area it's just an area that's evaluated if approved they would only be approved to locate the roads and the routes in the previously approved areas micro sighting areas which are the two gray areas and if approved those two new route Alternatives or micro exciting areas okay so I hope that helps we can stop thises Council have any questions about that because we can we can talk about it at next meeting too but I just want to make sure we're on on any yeah Cindy Condon for the record just a question you said that they're giving us can you go back to that slide they're with the Alternatives they're giving us some Alternatives really we're evaluating the Alternatives we're not choosing Alternatives correct correct cor thank you however if it's possible you could um uh approve blank blank blank alternative and then if one of the Alternatives didn't meet a standard you do have an option of saying you know approve blank blank blank alternative and because this one alternative doesn't meet a particular standard for such and such reason you could not approve one of the Alternatives right but our job is just does it meet the standard correct right yeah so yeah not giving you sorry giving you the option thank you okay so that is kind of separating definitions application of definitions and in council's rules um and then the second part is um very similar to RFA 1 we're adding on Alternatives and this is very similar to rfa1 they are adding on they're not saying we're not going to do you know like we're going to remove these as options they're still just adding on options so one of the ways that I like to discuss like obviously I'm where",

        "text": " the city again uh mayor horie is correct the city would set up the policy and and how it um identify the projects that it wanted to invest in and I think it kind of gets worse yeah and then we would we would be able to identify you know otherwise it's it's just all very nice things to say um when's the timeline for that next year um again we're we're putting up we were in development but because of the IRP and and um we have our short-term action plans we're putting out an RFP in 2023 and those um projects aren't a debt of potential projects unidentified until the spring of 2024 we anticipate that in 2024 we'll move forward on working understanding what um the short term what those projects are we'll look at the summer of 2024 for that program perfect thank you thank you any other questions well thank you very much Wendy we really appreciate it thank you and just so you know you guys are doing awesome we love Salem you're awesome to work with and you're an awesome community so I'm always here to answer questions I will follow up with you on the questions that you asked um executive summary uh as well as how does the Willow Lake play into your overall because that could slightly change that um and then also the storage project so I'll follow up on those and and send those along sounds great thanks bye bye all right plastic pollution and recycling modern organization act that just screams Ryan zinc all over it let's talk trash let's talk to that on the bottom or oh you'll see my notes that works um actually uh I don't think I brought enough for everyone but I do have slice to if you don't want to follow along uh and again has my notes so uh I guess I don't need to do introductions again but I'm Ryan franchise administrator out of the Budget Finance office so um just to be up front my my intent is not to give you a you know thorough understanding of this but just a very high level um just to introduce you to the idea of what's called the RMA or the plastic pollution and recycling modernization act this is a result of Senate Bill 582 from the 2021 legislative session and so we're now getting into um uh you know the again the result of that and the intent of that bill um and obviously happy to follow up with uh questions and information additional information uh after this um so this also is a direct tie-in to uh the client action plan um as the client action plan is being developed uh the RMA was also in its early early stages you might even you know embryo type um and so we included it as uh waste so let's uh materials and waste number seven under objective two so we were including that is because we knew it was going to be coming oh page 34 off on uh on appendix eight if you're if you're interested um so and then uh so I'm gonna do just a brief oh yeah go ahead next slide okay thank you um so big changes coming I'm apology I'm just going to read this a little bit I just want to make sure I get it right so the plastic pollution and recycling modernization act updates Oregon's recycling system by building a local community building on local community programs and leveraging resources from producers creating a system where everyone in Oregon has the same opportunities to recycle the law requires producers of packing Printing and writing paper and Food Service wear to receive to share responsibility for the effective responsible handling of their products after use the new law became effective January 1st 2022 and the program implementation begins in July of 2025. the Army Builds on existing standards and requirements from Oregon's opportunity to recycle Act and the new law creates you like this keep a new law creates many benefits for local governments including funding uh to expand recycling opportunities and to help reduce contamination in the recycling system so uh very briefly how it works again very very high level producers again of those products those listed products will join a producer responsibility organization and pay fees based on the products they sell in produce responsibility organizations or Pros you might also hear people call them Pros but pieros will use the fees to fund and reimburse variable various local recycling service expenses recycling processing facilities will establish new permit and certification a uniform Statewide collection list will establish a uniform list of materials that are recyclable across Oregon and local governments will receive financial support to expand Recycling services and address contamination so in order for us Salem and local governments to be eligible for that funding they needed to complete and submit A needs assessment survey by April 14th of 2023. yes we did after collaborating with their haulers Group Marion County and other local Partners we completed and submitted the needs assessment which will be reviewed by DEQ and passed on to the pros uh the questions of the survey survey again very high level um but they're engaging our existing Recycling services and assessing where we might expand service so briefly uh our existing recycling services uh are on Route uh we have on-route uh co-mingled for single family and multi-family even though the multi-family isn't widely used there's some issues there with again contamination and ownership of of that that type of thing causes uh there's you know there's issues here obviously on Route commingled Recycling services for commercial a residential curbside we and many of you have the little red or blue or different colored little plastic bin we pick up uh glass motor oil antifreeze household batteries I use paint or a paint and used excuse me use cooking oil we have recycling Depots throughout the and reload facility so the Murph the Marion resource recovery facility in Brooks uh is used as a Reload facility I can get into what that is if you want now there's a household hazardous waste facility out at uh skirts which is the Salem College transfer station so that's where if you again paint or fuels cleaning products anything there's a number of items that really shouldn't be thrown away but can be recycled through that uh hazardous waste facility and then we also have a electronics recycling or E-Waste program here in Salem so to the areas where we'd like to expand and literally there's a question on the survey do you want to expand your services we marked yes uh so for on Route there's three areas that they're looking at for expanding services so on Route we definitely want to expand our multi-family Recycling services for on-route that's also a an element of the RMA and I'll just read this too briefly uh for January of 2026 is a goal to ensure that newly purchased roll carts bins and containers oh sorry wrong one there it is I marked the wrong one here uh to ensure adequate recycling collection and access for multi-family housing again that's a goal for uh July of 2026 as part of one of the elements of the RNA multi-family we may be looking at expanding uh or adding additional deep recycling Depots Citywide there's going to be some guidance there's rulemaking happening right now we'll get into that in a moment there's rulemaking uh that that's going on and part of that rulemaking will be guidance on this is your population how many recycling Depots and and convenient locations should you have per thousand of populations that type of thing so we'll want to Benchmark against that can I ask you a question about that recycling Depots I'm not I'm only aware like I know I can go out to my garbage company I know I can go onto the transfer station or to other garbage companies I'm not aware of recycling Depots those are the recycling Depots okay every every recycling company at their their main location they have a spot designated or going out to skirts uh or uh yeah the the transportation transfer station recycling center has been designated over the past few years I mean if you go there today compared to what it used to be like um it's there's nothing I mean they they do cardboard and they do you know electronics and and those basic things but it used to be a robust system of I mean where you can take everything there and recycle is that ever going to come that's what this will help us do okay yeah that's that's that was my question okay okay because it and I guess kind of the other kind of offshoot of that is it seems like you know this has kind of been a county deal for ever right and it seems like we're kind of getting more involved in this is that kind of part of this program is that cities are getting more actively involved I think that is a part of it so Marion County is our waste shed that they're they're the owner of our way um and so they have uh historically taken on that role although uh officially it's the city's role but Marion County has through uh their program and funding that they get as part of our tipping fee uh to the the uh disposal fee primarily through covanta that's a that's a whole other conversation but um through through that that funds their uh Environmental Services Department and so as part of that they do a lot of work with Outreach creating uh trading material and just managing their waste shed very very well and we have benefited we're looking when looking at recovery numbers uh Statewide recovery numbers the number one or two in terms of recovery Statewide that's uh for for our relationship so that's that's the Benchmark I'm using yeah when I say very well and and I just thinking there's so much more we could do yeah when I think of it I'm like yeah the thing that we're like number one of a bunch of losers I mean you know what I mean like it's true I mean I don't mean that but personally it's like nobody's doing a great job if we're number one or two that's what I'm trying to say I would like to say that the household waste whatever out of skirts I think it's open like one day a month it's open six days during a month none of them to 3 30. and then my husband will go all the way out there and like take all the things that we've saved up because nobody's freaking has time to go there during the week and then they're like sorry we can only take four of those light bulbs you're gonna have to take the rest of those fluorescent tubes home and Isaac's like mother of right it's really cool sorry I'm passing on so household eggs to you all and I would love to see that Gene and I'm happy to pass that on to those that manage that facility and we can maybe provide uh provide some other",

        "text": " installations just kind of a percentage of them um but we do not have uh we'll provide more information about that as uh where the program gets I was gonna add James that there's not a an intention on our part to hold payment for units that we plan to inspect we would process payments as usual once we receive the notice of a complete project um and our verification that we do for quality assurance um may come in the same time frame where it may come slightly delayed from that thanks to both of you Rachel asked whether the PowerPoint will be emailed to you um no it will be posted to the web page for this program um which is accessible both on this um slide but also um on additional documents and emails that we have sent out including the one advertise this webinar um so that's where I would go to find the materials the most up-to-date Mitch asked does the income of either the tenant or the loan or factor into whether the rebates are granted know the income of only the tenant so it'll be the end user of the heat pump is the relevant income for the purposes of determining whether a higher rebate is available for the Daniel asked can I upload an electronic load calculation I don't know if I don't know if you already answered this happening with your previous answer um but yeah I would say that I think that there is a space in the application or the reservation request pardon me um for uh contractors to upload documents if they need to to support their request and so you could upload your load calculations there if that's the way you want to share your yeah Ronda asks to clarify everyone for Pace first peace for space in the mobile home park is eligible but they render on the trailer that's correct um it's has to do with the rental of the space rather than the ownership of the of the trailer for this program Jeremy asked do you have a method for dealing with multiple identical applications like identical units in an apartment complex oh I see what you're um I thought you meant duplicate it for the same unit um there's not currently a functionality within the um platform within the reservation request to apply for multiple units at once however that is a comment and feedback that we've received previously and so we are exploring um how that might be made possible but for the initial rollout of the request it will be per unit for each application they'll ask what customers be eligible for both Odo and Ira incentives um presumably yes I know we don't have full guidance on the IRA incentives yet but this is a stackable incentives so it could be combined with other ones including once from NG trust a utility other examples as Kayla pointed out in the presentation which I think answers the next question from Sydney so the controlling factor of course being that the incentives cannot um amount to more than 100 of the purchase and installation cost and it asks is the incentive amount cap for project um is the 4000 installation grant part of that no that's separated right so I think right so if I think if I understand correctly right there's a there's a separate dollar amount cap for the heat pump purchase installation versus the upgrade um costs so right so it'd be up to four thousand for an upgrade cost um for income qualifying uh households and then the cap for non income qualifying it's two thousand yeah and then for the rebates the incentives start at two thousand dollars and the abbreviate cap um for the actual installation of the heat pump is seven thousand and not be on the higher end Aaron has a question about mechanical um permits which I will pick to either James or Stephanie they say city of Portland is minor label mechanical permits most don't get an how do we preside with this proceed with this type of permit for proof with a photo of the permit in the panel work as proof or do we need to start full mechanical permits we are not asking anyone to go through the any permitting process that is not required by their local jurisdiction so following the local permitting process and getting just that minor permit um and sharing a copy of that permit or a picture of that permit in the space is acceptable and only inspection required as the local jurisdiction requires thanks Stephanie we have a question from Dave that I believe we got in the previous webinar which was whether units can be considered when they're between tenant occupancy and James can jump in and correct me if I'm wrong but I believe yes they are um eligible but they wouldn't be eligible for low to moderate income consideration since there's no existing Tim asked how much funding is available in this program to expect it to last through 2023 I would put that to James or Han yen a bit more experience in this incentive uh hey yeah this uh the uh bill that um established this program uh appropriated 15 million dollars uh for the program that includes obviously some uh program uh program Staffing costs um and everything but the the bulk of it um for rebates um there is a program Sunset um in the Bell uh legislature I think the and I can put that in the uh chat um once I find it thanks Jameson thanks to Scott for putting our web page for this program in the chat um appreciate that I think we answered Abby's question that yes it's possible for one project for one dwelling to receive up to 11 000 in a grant and rebate um see Scott asks looking on the website there appear to be two efficiency tiers but no information listed how are those tiers broken out so you'll find all of that in for the efficiency tiers Broken Out In which I can share in the chat now okay if I have it up somewhere and I can add that the the Baseline tier is just the new federal minimum and then the I can't remember off the top of my head with the increased efficiency values are like Patrick will get those linked for you shared it thank you Patrick can I just jump in with the uh yeah date for the end of the program uh so the original Bill had the the this section of the this program uh repealed uh the start of 2025 however um the bill was just passed to kind of and make sure that the the program would run through the end of the the 2025 so there will it the uh the whole Act is um the whole program is repealed uh start of 2026 uh and the program will run through the the 23 25 biennium assuming we always starts to go across the the governor's desk to be approved though thanks Kayla for entering Daniel's question in the chat about writing Anna asks about special considerations for multi-family properties they're a limit to the number of dwelling units that order will incentivize at once if I understand correctly is there a limit to the number of dwellings that can benefit from the program within one property in the answer is no to that as long as they're qualifying eligible each of the units could qualify or a rebate or Grant I've covered pretty much everything we've had a few repeat questions if I haven't answered your question feel free to put it in the chat again we certainly have the registration open um and there is not currently a date for the reservation Open start date we're trying to get as many contractors approved before then so that way you guys are ready impression has to follow up about a date and that's right Kayla mentioned there's no specific date for stranger accept reservations they're still um some updates to be made to the reservation request prior to release um including from feedback that we received from well we've got a one payment question and one technical question so first I'll read the payment questions and toss that to James uh what payments we made to contractors as paper checks mailed out or done by electronic transfer or what we need to set up any type of System payment portal or anyone who wants to answer that it's fine um I can start and uh maybe Doug if you have some additional experience uh you can add any additional details um so we're able to make payment by check all electronic transfer and it will depend on whether you have um set up electronic transfer with the Oregon Department of administrative so there is a form you're able to submit to them um to set that that up and Doug if you want to add anything please feel free I'll just say if there's questions about how to uh set up electronic transfers um please feel free to email the the program as well so it looks like Stephanie has offered some guidance on the technical question having to do with Douglas systems and a little calculation that can put in the chat so Tim let us know if that clarifies things and then Chris asked is this intimate to oh I see I don't know that the rules considered the hspf to requirements if someone can jump in about that I'm not sure I'm not sure of the records um Chris that you're making oh I guess you added the rules above it looks like there's two different hsps 2 efficiencies for the two different identified types of people I think I see what ducted systems typically have a slightly lower efficiency than a um non-ducted unit uh I can take a closer look at that and back to you or we can incorporate it into one of our FAQs if uh you give me a a little bit of time to look back around for how we were coming up with those values Chris let's think of that question if you want to drop uh contact info in the chat for us um that'd be helpful we can make sure we uh get back directly to you once we get our response for you thanks Stephanie um Kayla Scott was asking again about the no sorry wait let's go a bunch of comments just came in someone was asking about the income information again so I don't know if you can talk a little bit about the anticipated guidance documents for the income verification stuff um yeah eventually they'll all be posted on the website on the um contractor portion which I can show you that on my screen um it'll be in the more information or in the resources portion um there will be a guide um that will show what household what the household income must be to verify based off of the number of occupants in the household um and then we do have the options already on here I don't believe those have the income chart that I'm talking about right now but that will be added but it's under forms if you want to see the voter motor income options that are thanks Kayla Matthew asked how long does it take for a contractor registration to be approved",

        "text": " you yeah thank you I got it all right and so uh maybe I'll just jump to the Chart here but again as you're saying I think what what we find in this scenario is that by creating some additional bonding capacity it will help us to address that backlock of projects and begin ramping up with newer projects a little bit sooner than we would otherwise and so what we've tried to do here is again depicting that potential um Feathering if you will of existing Project work with new project work over this next say five to six year cycle so the dark blue in this case so the there's light blue there's medium blue and there's dark blue right for what my eyes see yes so the medium blue is the completion of the 3D 3E projects correct and the dark blue is that ramping up of the funding towards 3F new projects correct okay correct yay I'm still Debt Service and the gray is Debt Service yeah and you'll see the debt service has increase here because we would be bonding twice as much right so the debt Services higher in this scenario and what you'll see and again these are these are still conceptual they're not super detailed at this point but what what we're trying to depict here is that again this helps to initiating new projects in the upcoming fiscal year that helps to reduce that pipeline Gap that we were anticipating between prior projects and future projects yeah and so we think that this is really the the scenario and and our recommendation to proceed would be based on this scenario and we think it achieves the best balance between incurring Debt Service to try to help catch up but also helping to ensure that we have a somewhat consistent project pipeline so so that we're able to keep staff busy and continue doing doing the good work and and I know you'll have heard and we'll probably continue to hear there's lots of demand for these Services as or um you know improvements as well so we think this is a good balance between those different competing um desires if you will and then the final scenario so this was the scenario we called the 150 scenario so really looking at bonding both the 60 million for bonding cost sharing and potentially bonding for the entire $90 million um funding Gap this is not our recommendation also because we really don't think as I mentioned it it probably swings too far on the side of taking on additional debt that we probably don't need to um and again additional Debt Service simply you know uh reduces our potential for what we do with those funds in in real time if you will and so you'll see see here we also propose bonding over four years but at a slightly higher amount so about 37.5 million per year over four years achieves the full $150 million in bonding and this one again just simply helps to advance new projects a little bit sooner but um we think again the the the prior scenario really is achieves the best balance of all these different things that we're H to achieve could I pause there for just one second I'm not going to put you on the spot on this one I'm going to put Miss Angie on the spot for this one uh if I heard Stephen right um this is not the preferred scenario because it goes too far for taking on additional debt I'd like to unpack that a little bit um because folks take on mortgages for houses right the idea of taking on debt debt isn't necessarily A Bad Thing uh but I need you to help bring to life why it leans more towards bad versus good and I'm thinking about things like does it mean that what are we putting at risk if we were to make this decision is it our bond rating or what what what is put at risk um so that's a good question um I would also defer and get a further answer from Greg mun when he's here what I will say is the more the board um ties up uh revenues in debt it limits the opportunity for flexibility in in the future of those funds so there could be um opportunities to further leverage Transportation projects to be flexible and Nimble so that's where issuing more debt um it really contains you into what you're currently issuing the debt for with the flexibility in projects but we have the ability to issue debt that that's not a concern but what looking at this slide and commissioner Rogers you might want to chime in to see if I'm on the right school of thought commissioner Rogers has been influencing us to bond as early as we can and so that's one reason why exploring this is just a flavor of that bonding that amount earlier versus waiting later uh as far as I haven't until I'm told otherwise I'm going to assume that if we choose today to do 150 million that you have what you need well you have what you need the MIP d and e projects are all defined so um and it only put you in a better position for completing the definition of a 3F list right so this you're being too vague for my taste uh on why it would be a bad thing so I'm just going to leave it there for uh to come back to it with Mr mun because I'm seeing it as the opposite okay yeah and I might to to your point I I may just add I think I think there is this notion that we we think that the 120 million scenario sort of carries us through this current Gap issue and so it is that tradeoff I think of just what's the amount that we need to bond in order to complete this obligation if you will or commitment and not as uh Miss Angie was just suggesting you know not tying up future revenues uh more so than may be needed and um I think this is a good might be a good segue as we start to Pivot to thinking a little bit more about what the future of a program might look like too so these we know we as much as we're trying right as much as we're trying to step through these in a very sequential and somewhat segregated way you really can't because everything is implicates the fut you know you do now implicates the future and vice versa so yeah so yeah thanks for coming on the journey with us because so I think chair that's an outstanding question we will take and take that back and work on a concrete answer to that thank you yes thank you I don't think we have a clear enough answer right since 120 still doesn't get of d and e done done and 150 does get all of d and e done I still don't see that we we have a clear definition of what the difference is between a 120 and a 150 but from the standpoint of a value for us to make a final decision I don't think we have enough data okay we'll bring that back that's a critical piece that's missing in my opinion sorry great it's good feedback thank okay so um we just took a quick look at some of the pros and cons so this kind of ties into our discussion that we were just having here so um as we looked at these again just thinking about balancing out that ongoing Debt Service um required for the improvements uh along with the availability of both um County staff but also contractor and consultant capacity so again as we were considering those those factors we just felt that the $120 million scenario looked like a sweet spot for all of those different reasons so the right amount of money over the right period of time to help mitigate um that funding Gap uh but not taking on maybe additional Debt Service if it wasn't necessary but we uh definitely appreciate your your point and we'll come back with some additional analysis looking at these two these two options any questions before we move on okay I would make a comment if I can um first of all U Stephen thank you for uh moving a whole bunch off your conservative position before about not bonding as you know I I I was set to do this and hope that we'd do this a year ago because I could see that costs were accelerating and you might share with the board what they are I mean they between 12 and 20% and we I knew we could bond at that time at 3 4% so I want to congratulate you it's always hard I know in the public sector to take a little bit of risk a couple other little points then I'll listen to the rest of presentation uh when the chair was asking about colors and how they how they work and what that means the public will ask the same thing so I I think that you've done an excellent job I certainly wouldn't criticize that but I think it needs to be a little more descriptive in what you're presenting because it it it's confusing uh you you've got people five people sitting there four and myself who uh who've been through this a bit and we're still saying well what does that color mean and what does this do and how does that do so I I I would say that as far as your U ask on the you know whether the 120 or 150 I I tend to swing for the fences because I think that we know our costs are going to go up are we going to be be in a recession I don't know about that but if we are then we've bet wrong at the 150 if things go uh kind of bumping along like they are now we won't complete a bunch of projects and those who come after us are going to say what were you thinking I mean you you could have done what you needed to do so uh I I tend to go to the 150 but if you're I mean you've come a long ways from nothing so I I mean 120 at least gets it somewhere uh the last thing I hope that you presting your presentation these are just the projects that are in the pipeline we're not talking about the opportunity fund and you might want to that's been such a hugely successful program and are there opportunities and I know we get into the big city versus little cities and who has money and who doesn't but we do have a gas tax that we share even though it's very modest and we do have the ability to go after State money and federal money is there an opportunity and using that opportunity fund question to say to cities GE we could do a bit more if you're willing to come in with some of your funds I mean we all know how they you know the 503020 works uh these are projects some of them I can pick them off if you went back the list benefit cities as much as",

Rogers uh seconding uh all in favor of uh establishing a subcommittee please say aye aye any opposed very good um you know uh with the subcommittee that went over the applications that's was that three board and one or two applications yeah there is that was the plan originally but unfortunately one of the facility operators the county person wasn't able to attend any application um Matt could I anticipate after the ark Festival you would potentially be interested in participating on this subcommittee yeah thanks for the orientation and definitely after art fair thank you yes it's almost over it's all right um so uh we can go offline to kind of yeah if there are people interested we would want to have at least three board and two uh Grant recipients on the subcommittee so if you have an interest if you want to email Chris and then he can draw straws if we've got more people we can use for uh making sure we don't have a quorum at the subcommunity level so but uh uh I think that'll be great so thank you very much for bringing up the points Matthew and uh are there any other comments regarding the boring criteria I'd be happy to serve on that committee thank you Sally and then all right so uh we have the or you know we need to vote on the the Grant application changes uh changes that were reviewed last month and up for second reading and they have emotion in the second or okay okay so we can get a motion to approve the changes yes I would like to make a motion to improve the changes made by the subcommittee to the event project and facility applications and then the second oh second all right thank you Roger uh okay so we have a first and the second all in favor please say aye any opposed very good passes unanimously Chris if you'd like to go over the culture institution funded reports these oh there's not one sorry we've got the long ones yeah this is the busy season yes indeed yes uh facility operator Grant reports we just have the US North theater any questions about that their application are reporting report sorry and these are all reports Sally you guys have definitely been hopping lately so yes we have it's um been a busy tune and busy July um where August will be a little quieter normal summer quiet for us it's great I mean to have so much on the calendar all right uh and uh Americans for hearts uh report got a party plan so there's a party plan for November 7th um starting sometime around nine o'clock in the morning over at the Salem Art about how the surveys went next steps and reports come in that you achieved the goal we fell short of our goal probably Nationwide you were in the 10 or I think we we hit 80 of the goal 80 85 yeah it's from uh from as hard as it sounded like it was to get uh feedback you probably that's pretty adamable also yeah it was definitely a heavier list than most people expected all right and uh Matthew thank you for offering the host that event got our uh Roundtable so if we uh I want to go ahead and start uh sharing what's going on in your world we're at summer and uh Christine with those Willamette Master chorus and we in the process of putting together all the information for our next uh input we have the information but putting it on paper to get it out to our our guests and take a purchasers and um looking for sponsorships and all those other good things that happened over the summer our first concert is our veterans concert um in the middle of November and this year because of a donation from a veterans family we are giving free tickets to All Veterans for our concert and it will be held in Smith Auditorium so there will be plenty of seating for hi hello uh my name is we're hosting our two events our first event which is in August of 2020 August 24 and 25 uh this year which is our competition uh for fungal competition and right now we are out of June and July we've been really busy with all the time trying to get our sponsorships uh we recently just got our acceptance by our music our live music so we're gonna be posting live music as well and we are going to be doing our event and the oh thank you owner yeah and our second event which is tielo Muertos we are hosting it in November first weekend of November and we are still we're still working on that as Chris if you want to call and order where's the online there it is so uh Michael I see your first face sorry was that Matthew was that me Chris Matthew yeah that was that was you um so big thing for us is Art Fair next uh Friday Saturday Sunday we'll start at 10 o'clock with the Children's

        "text": " was a lot of information but these are just kind of examples um of the types of work we do right now you know our work is um we're still working on a lot of tribal projects um but with the recent portland clean energy fund awards um and the community renewable energy grant program we do also have a lot of projects that we're focused on in portland and in oregon so happy to uh answer any that people might have thank you all thanks rob good to see you too yeah thanks uh the community solar project you said that the local electric co-op is providing bill saving is doing the transaction on the customer's bill were they already doing that under kind of a structured community solar program offering and this was just one of the projects or did they actually start doing that for this project i find that remarkable they started doing that for this project which is you know one of the reasons why glacier electric co-op that go up um out there was just terrific and you know we we have relationships with utilities throughout the region and they're obviously not all the same and some are a lot more progressive than others and their you know desire to support virtual net metering so this was kind of a shining example of that and they were willing to try that out for the first time i will say that after this project um they did provide feedback in that it's been a little bit of an administrative burden managing all of the information and so i think for the next project with the tribe they're they're not interested in virtual net metering um just because they have their hands full right now but it was groundbreaking just to kind of um see them take that step forward for the first time thank you great i don't see any of their hands up but i do see a comment um this is nikita she's just saying that she really appreciates the emphasis on relationship building in these projects and in meeting community needs so i just wanted to share that anything else from anyone before we move on to the next topic and of course we are happy to have questions in the chat rafaela can stay for a few minutes after see if any of those questions come up she can answer and then we can also email her after if any of the questions come up after you know there were a bunch of people that were really excited to have you come present so thank you so much for making it work yes thank you all right well i don't see any other hands so i'm going to turn it over to megan levy from um so is she there she is okay pass it over to you and again just let me know when you want me to change slides great thank you so much and thanks to um all the folks at the oregon department of energy for uh inviting me so i've got a few slides i'm gonna whip through them pretty fast just talk a little bit about the wisconsin perspective um and and mainly about critical infrastructure microgrids for resilience and and why we decided to go that route um and it may be some way that will uh apply future infrastructure act funding so next slide i won't even read this one to you but just like the oregon department of energy we are a state energy office and we were created by the energy policy and conservation act of 1975 got a few statutory things we got to do the big one that i'm going to focus on is create an energy emergency plan that we can utilize in the case of an energy supply disruption and so the risk assessment along with creating that plan is sort of where a lot of these programs have come from next slide please why do we think about this stuff because we have a 14 billion dollar problem in wisconsin we consume six times more energy than we produce um from transportation to buildings we're we're getting it from everywhere and uh it's not sustainable and it's killing the planet next slide please um and so what have we sort of done i've been at the energy office for about a decade now started off taking over our energy independent communities program it's a lot like oregon we're fiercely independent in wisconsin and nobody likes a mandate but we love a voluntary program so we invited folks to set a goal the governor's goal at the time was 25 of the power that we consume should be from renewable energies in state by 2025. a lot of those goals so 150 communities signed up between 2007 and 2010 a few have straggled in over the years in between um we gave big grants from the american recovery and reinvestment active folks to plan to implement we had eecbg at the time energy efficiency conservation block grant which is coming back in the infrastructure act and it was really great to have these energy plans and to have folks following through now many of these goals are 100 percent by 2050 and uh and it's pretty exciting that about 60 percent of our total population actually lives in an energy independent what we learned from those grants was that the biggest barrier other than funding for communities is technical assistance folks are just not quite sure is this the right project should i do solar first should i do energy efficiency first should i do them at the same time and it's a role that energy offices can can fill i'll just mention our petroleum shortage contingency planning because we stole a concept from you all that we think is uh is pretty brilliant called fueling points of distribution uh we're actually looking at doing a clean energy version of fueling points and distribution where we use solar and storage or hydrogen fuel cell a battery something to back up fueling location so in the event of a shorter long-term power outage we can still fuel those utility line trucks and we can uh get the lights back on as quickly as so that's part of our overall energy security planning and response and out of that we decided to merge this sort of community energy planning thing with energy emergency plans we did a survey of local emergency managers we found a lot of them didn't understand the energy profile the state didn't have a specific energy emergency plan but many of them were super interested in things like hardening critical infrastructure with energy that's created closer to it so along with alternative fuel vehicles going to the next slide please so and this is just in that statewide assistance for energy resilience and reliability got to have a good acronym safer too we've recruited tribes and communities to do this deep dive analysis and we don't prescriptively tell them what it is you don't have to have a critical infrastructure microgrid feasibility study done but many have opted for that we do tabletop exercises we walk folks through planning processes we create their own field coordination group and we usually have them identify feeling points of distribution we've wrapped up with a tabletop exercise in april and a regional exercise where we had deanna henry from oregon come and talk to us about your western petroleum collaborative uh which was very interesting because even though we're trying to get off petroleum we need to understand it and we need to we need to collaborate across the midwest to to be able to get through extreme situations we'll go on to the next slide please i don't want to forget about biogas we've done a couple of surveys in wisconsin in 2020 we did a biogas survey where we identified certain policy drivers uh unlike many west coast states we do not have an aggressive rps that's a problem we do not have consistent incentives in a state where it would seem to make so much sense to have something like cow power next slide we don't have that in fact most of our utilities have have opted out of ppas with large farms and with farms with digesters but although the cow fart backpack is not on the streets yet we are having some more kind of success with smaller digesters and our dane county landfill which is the county i'm in has now a loading dock on the interstate pipeline for folks that have smaller digesters to bring their gas clean it up on the skid and insert it to the pipeline which is in wisconsin the most uh sort of economically viable thing to do uh but we you know the recommendations from the farmers from the municipal uh operators was mandate food waste let's have a standard more funding more and and certainly something to deal with the upfront cost next slide so there's some resources for you you can access those uh those surveys on our website we'll move on to the next slide because i just want to mention that energy justice is such a crucial component of energy security which is a crucial component to the clean energy transition and especially when we're talking about small-scale renewables and looking at you know who is going to be left in the rate base if we're able to lift uh these critical infrastructure microgrids off i think that's why we started with critical infrastructure everybody wins when the water utility is uh using less energy because all ratepayers are going to benefit from that i'll point out the labs are doing a lot on this right now i was involved in this energy storage for social equity initiative with sandia and pacific northwest national labs um keep your eye on that there's a lot of folks in the northwest who were at least a few who were awarded um this is a technical assistance program with an eye on implementation in the future we'll go on to the the next slide please um so wisconsin's program critical infrastructure microgrid and community resilience center pilot grant program uh like i said we borrowed ideas from oregon in our petroleum planning and we're not shy we researched new york connecticut new jersey rhode island maryland massachusetts because people get all mad when we research california they're like that's not the same so we looked at these other folks and we designed a program memorandum next slide please where we outline the strategic objectives and i just want to point out you know the biggest thing was energy security and clean energy equity um these two us are are sort of the biggest issues because this is born out of this risk assessment from this atmosphere that we have in wisconsin where we're vulnerable to directions tornadoes flooding big blow downs that are harder to predict than hurricanes that you can typically see coming for quite some time but we're also we're really concerned with disadvantaged communities and how we can make sure that we're serving them appropriately when they don't have the upfront costs typically to invest in in so i'll go on to the next slide and we defined critical infrastructure your",

        "text": " fees are based on the engineering News West record uh tables upon construction costs and so we'll take the fees from for example this year 20 223 adjust those basically think what has happened in the past move them up so it's like a year I guess my concern was I would want someone that hey what will cost 10 years in the if your fee is assessed at the time had a related questions on that um administrative rule that will be written to include the cost per linear foot discussion if that sounds like it's part of the administrative writing could we get people from the construction industry and part of that conversation because I think you'll have better buy-in when you're writing a rule that's going to affect them if you have somebody at the table representing that the answer yes a huge thank you for really providing such a thorough and love research response to my questions like this is huge and really answer a lot of my preliminary hesitancy about this um yeah I'm really excited about the potential of being able to apply these family payments to uh you know actually get things done in these projects forward I think this has a lot of potential and I think it is really Innovative so um I just really want to just express my I just been grateful for the little that you put in to respond to that I do have a few kind of uh things that came up like as you know go through your responses and you know did some looking into the CIP and trying to wrap my head around what this would look like in um and so the first one I kind of wanted to address um you mentioned Transportation at ccs and and one of your examples in the supplemental software um did a breakdown based on Transportation assistance but there is um under be in one of the sections the um that addresses being moved now um it says payment amounts except for mitigation measures associated with the traffic transmission planning analysis shall be limited by the following proportionality constraints and that's the section where it goes into those SDC limits for um what I would assume would be up like secs other than Transportation so can you explain the implications of that and why uh basically Transportation projects are presented from that SDC cap so my understanding um is that when a project comes so the segment of new application or subdivision application comes in they submit a traffic impact analysis that's looking at neighboring intersections and um and how that development specifically impacts those things and we're exempting Tia mitigation that's required so an engineer and traffic engineer looks at the proposal they recommend mitigation that would be needed to ensure that the streets are um adequately operating and so the reason CIA mitigation is removed from that is that we need the ti mitigation to allow the development to um to proceed and to ensure that the streets are packed adequately operated capacity so those are those Gia mitigation is generally above and beyond typical Boundary Street improvements um that we would see if it would be used the kids I appreciate that and so I um my second question is um the criteria for determining when a when a family will be allowed and I think that the way that it's written is really broad right it's not like a fear and objective series of criteria is allowed um and I think that in the past that just that particularly been such a huge issue because typically those feelings are basically what you could be paying anyways to construct the mitigation so it's like whatever the director or public works you know thinks it's applicable that's pretty in line with what because we propose like I don't think there's been I know a ton of conflict over whether or not um should be allowed but when these SDC have I think my concern is well I have two concerns I guess uh the first is I think this might open the door to more developers and more projects be really pushing for this right whereas like they might have like a say a 50 000 Street Frontage Improvement due to specific site constraints but because that's not proportionate in terms of the SDC cap there you might have more people saying like well that's actually significantly less than what I would be paying otherwise and so I feel like this maybe will make it more difficult for staff to or you guys might maybe see more developers pushing back or really like advocating for let me do the feed and Lou so that's my one term I don't know if you guys have thought that through or kind of address how that might look in practice I guess um we didn't vet the criteria a bit more to make sure it's more clear Effectiveness to when it's allowed and in the draft administrative rule we also have some additional criteria of when staff should be using family that helps um that's not necessarily the code language but that is in how we would apply it based on the administration yeah I mean I think I'd like to see a doctors presented to council that's more specific and more objective in terms of when doing don't apply these because I mean I think the idea here is really clear that there's you know we only want to see things applied when it's clearly something that you don't want to just put a sidewalk in the middle of a quarter mile of you know sidewalks or you know 12 inch sewer line connecting the two eight inches through lines for 400 feet right I think it makes sense and I understand that I just think that it would be I think it might be pertinent to have that more fleshed out and now that this is probably going to be a more I don't know desirable thing for some developments then I will just answer I just add that um part of the issue with feet but you know seeing Luke is that it's not a right it's always a choice uh by the director and what is the best option there because a lot of direct developers find Value and pay forget it would take care of you but in some cases it's not even if the project might qualify for those things we still might not say no because it's it's a discretionary did you have did you have another question before I went to Commissioners later I do have other questions that um I think I think maybe that's fine to defend second important we'll come back to you if your questions thank you I'm trying to understand this in the context of something I could understand in my own neighborhood and when uh commissioner Global talked about the criteria that made me think a little bit more about this so what I'd be interested in understanding is under what context a developer or I'm just going to call it an applicants an applicant can can choose or the city would use fee and Lua and I'll give you an example that this warranty kind of knows quite well which is my hobby course of rubitz Road um which is a important in my neighborhood industry that doesn't have a lot of sidewalks and I've been told if I never will have these sidewalks because it falls exactly between the priorities for the bond and what the what the state or the federal government will fund um so my question I guess is that if if people are not doing it incrementally on a street like rubitz where it would be kind of an island okay we've got six houses and one does it that may be the best we're going to get for a long time or the second that it could be if two or three people wind up doing that all of a sudden that it costs the city less money to fill that space um they can say oh this used to be a million dollar project but because we've had all these little incremental improvements now it's a 300 000 project and we can fund that uh and I worry that this fee in lieu of can be used as a way or as the consequence the unattended consequence of avoiding infill improvements that could generate long-term improvements is that hypothetical or is that scenario make well you illustrate that it is trade-offs really we do we collect fees in Louisiana and completes that record that visas have not been used because there's no value in a ten thousand dollar whatever there's no value and on the other end they'll say all the time we also have examples where we put little gaps the sidewalks in and the gaps are still there some years later um so we have examples where we had had more money could have done more we might be able to do more with this it's a policy call but you are correct there's aspects where one neighborhood might say no we're never going to get a qualified but if we're able to be flexible on using a payment of a female lieu of constructive sidewalk in 20 different places to build it in one there's a benefit for that for the trade-off is the other whatever that comes out doesn't work that's that's part of the challenge in this um so the example of Rubik's we could have someone improving their lot on Rubens make a fee in lieu of developing their portion of the sidewalk on that street and then that money in this proposal would instead of being used on rubitz or the right neighborhood could be used to improve South Mill Creek or some other part of the community that is our recommendation that's a trade-off again right well I appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on the trip and then also too um my understanding of reading the report is the CIP has determined those priorities are determined by Council so I would assume your counselor would be very vocal and you know Advocate every fun yeah I'm going to move thank you two questions one of which is almost a might be a copier finals but beauty is pretty familiar with this because we have a situation on Salem Heights where it had a big to them they put in they're required to put in Cyclone particular location behind the street five foot locker only sidewalk on the street Community sponsored City started a process work with the community and we're about to close a plan for an improvement plan where the primary alternative is a multi-use path so and I'm wondering how would that be an instance where if this was in place that the discretion and seeing Lou would be an option development heights yeah um they're asking whether we could have accepted a fee including them really that sidewalk I'm I'm asking if what you're proposing would have been in effect at the top of that yeah I think we could I mean the option would have been that would have been caught us off whether we would have accepted it or not uh I don't know uh because I understand there's a lot there's complicated that is a fascinating question yes but it's a similar situation where low priority in terms of improvement Transportation plan the whole reasonably developed an improvement Place hopefully",

        "text": "5050 um committee uh we also have three advisors to that committee so I serve as an adviser our safety coordinator serves as an adviser and our risk manager also advises to that committee um and then one person out of the 10 person committee is appointed as chair um and facilitates meetings so the Safety Committee like I mentioned has been a longstanding committee but now we just have that second role of looking specifically at security incidents that's great thank you does is the composition of that committee is it a self- selection self volunteering could you help me understand the process so normally for non-represented staff they volunteer or they're appointed based on the role and their organization and for represented staff they are voted in by their peers to represent the represented staff on that committee that's great to hear and if I am a member of Staff however not a member of the security committee or the Safety Committee do I have a a formal venue to make my concerns heard before that committee the committee members part of their respons responsibility is to reach out to their co-workers and get feedback and concerns we also um have reporting tools mostly on the safety side we haven't formalized it as much on the security side because this role of that group is fairly new but we have Hazard reporting reports and things like that for the safety side that we can definitely incorporate to help bring information in from staff to the security committee meetings as well um but we also look at incident reports we look at a lot of policy that that is occurring unfortunately there are enough security incidents that we have an idea of what the trends are and that's what the committee's focused on at this time really kind of addressing the things that we're seeing on an ongoing basis that relate to security great thank you um and last I I just want to say that I appreciate the systemic look that you and your team are taking with this in particular you you mentioned system specifically when referring to that committee and I I think that's invaluable um as others of my colleagues have noted and you yourself have noted that what we are witnessing today I mean public transit I think is I'm I'm changing tracks now um public transit is a microcosm of the public and uh it is wonderful and challenging at the same time for that very same reason um and so many of the societal issues that we collectively are facing are reflective in transit but that's for many people the only time they're confronted by it and um I think that is one of the Beauties uh of public transit so uh that's all to say that that is a reflection of systemic issues um there are multiple systems there's CommunityWide systems but there also agency systems and so I just really want to appreciate uh extend my appreciation to you for thinking systemically so thank you thank you other questions or comments please um thank you director Davidson I am wondering um you know I'm sort of looking at our entire packet all 7133 pages of it um and you know thinking about the title 6 report that we received just a a little bit ago um I'm wondering how the the demographic makeup of you know our our whole body of security officers reflects our community I know let me let me start by saying and I meant to um I know last year when you were here um we talked about uh Spanish language access and people who were bilingual as part of that um group and and and you talked a little bit so I was just kind of thinking you know maybe in addition to language access or um bilingual individuals uh filling those roles is does it look representative um or is that not the case director Carney I think we're getting there I I don't know if we reflect the community as well as I hope we can at some point um but we do have male M and female officers we've got a variety of different age groups represented on the security team um we opened it up for eligibility for the contractors to have a variety of different skills and backgrounds from corrections to law enforcement military private security so we've got a variety of different backgrounds there too um we do have a a couple of officers who are bilingual so I think as we add more officers we'll be able to increase the diversity of that team as well that would be good news thank you manager Garcia thank you very much for your report thank you next up we have our final informational report of the evening dealing with battery electric buses I'll ask our chief operations officer Tom Deets to present the good evening vice president Davidson members of the board um Greg's on vacation so I'm pinch hitting for me so surprise uh so yeah to just bring you up to speed on where we're at with the battery electric bus um and I I changed uh the first picture of Greg's from the catalog image to a chariots beb caught in the wild so that was the the first beb to roll off the line in Livermore California um so I can tell you without too much of a spoiler alert we're so close you can feel the electricity not a Bo I have more uh so just kind of a recap uh this is old news even for old news so um we the Chariots submitted for alono Grant in 2015 uh we were not successful um so we continued to work and uh applied for and received uh pretty amazing back-to-back Lono Awards in fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 uh for a total of 10 battery electric buses in addition uh chariots was then awarded a congressionally directed spending grant for an additional five so those uh will be going into production soon so we'll have the those um in about 18 months 20 months uh is a lead time on that uh so uh we have a number of Partners and I'll get to a slide where um I can brag on them as as um much as you'll allow um so we partnered with uh charge Point uh for plug-in charging at Dell web um so and the these pictures I'm going to refer to these a lot so um seal these two images in your brain cuz I'll go back to them uh up there you'll see uh four little refrigerator looking boxes uh and then one that looks like um your standard uh EV plug-in charger so those are distribution blocks so when I say power block or distribution block those are what I'm referring to um one of those distribution blocks Powers two dispensers so um you'll you'll it'll make sense in a minute uh and then we also have partnered with uh well we started with momentum Dynamics and they changed their name to induct EV uh for inductive pickup infrastructure at Kaiser so what you see there is a marketing image but um uh you'll you'll get the real deal here in just a second so here are our chariots partners and I will apologize in advance if I have neglected anyone um but I think I got most of them uh but you know you see up there of course gillig uh for the actual bus cumin for the batteries uh and then we've got PGE which uh they've just been incredible partners and we're in their partner program up at Kaiser um for the charging infrastructure at Kaiser Salem electric uh for our power needs at Del Web and of course induct DV charge point and our contractors um uh CTE Consultants that are helping us through uh all of this and then the actual contractors JH Kelly for work up at Kaiser and ec electric for work at Web so where are we out so far so uh we did a bus procurement um checked that box uh the buses were built uh and delivered uh in they started arriving in June of this year and right now we have all 10 of them on property and I got to say they look amazing so just I wanted to show you this CU this is kind of a peak behind the curtain um so this is the actual build that is our first bus um going down the line uh and Seth Hamlin uh was living it up in an imaginary driver's seat and then uh almost a driver's seat uh and then there's the bus uh just outside the plant at the charging uh at the charger uh where all the team was there and they got to go on their first ride so now uh fast forward to uh just last month a construction at Kaiser Transit Center started uh and it is taking shape so I have lots of pictures uh so Kaiser Transit Center um is a very familiar uh aerial view there you'll see it's very difficult to see but you see the the bus stop icons all around the island um but the lower right hand three you'll see have little yellow dots on them those will be the inductive pickup p pads um at those uh it's Bay uh e f and g if you're familiar with that uh so it went from what you see on the left to trenching so we had trenching and line boring going on um and they have really done tremendous work in a short period of time so now you see uh this is obviously less glamorous than the marketing photo of the induct evv charging pad um but what you see here is a charging pad uh in the ground uh each one of those squares um represents a 75 kwatt per hour charger so all four of them when the bus kneels all the way down to uh create the magnetic field 300 kilowatt per hour uh will be charging uh the vehicle and each pad is uh supplied by 12 conduit uh so it it is quite quite a sight to see you can see as you navigate around there you've got the the 90 degre sweeps that are going under the dryve apron to the charging pad hole and then the stub UPS where the cabinets will go so what's next um so we'll finish uh construction at Kaiser Transit Center should be uh done in December of this year we are approximately and I don't want to uh say it too loudly but we're about a week and a half in some change ahead of schedule at um Kaiser so the one that I the picture I showed you with the pad in the ground um that was that picture is two weeks old and right now all three locations are backfilled and ready for concrete we were uh scheduled to set the last pad on October 12th we're ahead of schedule so that's that's great news So the plan was to energize um energize ktc the week of December 18th so um right now with with our schedule and UL testing and certification and um signing off uh we",

        "text": " benefit or cost on the vertical axis meaning up and down uh and below the line meaning they're a net benefit above the line meaning they're a net cost and the uh the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions is represented by the width of the bar or on the x-axis so in this particular case the new construction building codes uh the most cost-effective net benefit for uh in this modeling it shows a significant benefit to be had net benefit to be had that total cost minus savings equals net and it has a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions some of them are are have have less benefit some of them have costs i like the yellow one and uh and and some are are wider and and some are are skinnier depending on how much greenhouse gas emissions they reduce so that's kind of the basis of of what a mac curve is um and in the the legend up here it shows the the build the the different programs that we have in each scenario and they're segregated out by the ones that have provide net benefit and the ones that have net cost from a lease cost planning perspective the way you would implement this is that you would start on the left and do the most cost effective blue one and go to work your way through the mac curve all the way over to the right to the other blue curve or blue box and that would be the least cost effect and by the time you got to the other ones on the far left you hope that either technology or other things lowered the cost so that you didn't that you uh that they would be more cost effective one of the key things about this kind of graphic is that all these programs that and actions that are over here on the left the most cost effective ones are the ones that create net benefits so they have kind of built-in incentives or built-in market mechanisms that allow the marketplace and and uh private industry or third parties to be able to implement these or or have them occur relatively quickly by by government action and uh as opposed to the ones that are on the far right which have a cost and probably uh will need incentives or programs or regulations in order to achieve them um the many of you have heard of the the uh resilient energy building task force or rebuilding task force that's going on right now they're kind of working on the book ends of this you know i think this will be a very interesting curve to them i'd like to turn this over to chris at ssg and yule and and have them talk about a little bit more about how they built this mac curve and what they put into it excellent um yeah so i guess the underlying data around this so ever we've built a financial dictionary that we've shared with uh with the with odo um and and kathy and i'm sure that they're happy to share it with uh with the rest of the the rest of the group um which outlines kind of the cost uh capital costs for example for building retrofits or heating equipment or vehicles as well as maintenance and operation costs associated with those and energy costs associated with different energy currencies that were represented in the and so by applying those those uh those costs to um to the actions that that we've modeled um and taking the difference uh from uh the the the fraud scenario or the the kind of the the the planned action scenario develop under development and applied uh actions and taking the difference between that and and these um and these scenarios that we've represented we can get what the what the difference in costs uh and cost would be across both cost those kind of areas so the main areas being capital costs operation maintenance and then energy costs so some of those will be a positive some of the savings and basically we we look at those action by action we take uh a net present value of the of each of all of those costs over uh over time so and we discount using a discount rate of three percent obviously we can do some sensitivity around different discount rates to get different uh different lenses which with which to view this but once you've uh once you've discounted those the those values then we divide that by the emissions reductions on each of those actions that we've seen so the wedge that allen showed you earlier we would take the cumulative total of those emissions reductions over the whole time frame of that action um and that'll be the uh the that'll then we'll take the the cost and divided by that that emissions reduction then that will get you um those the graphs that alan are showing right now yeah anything anything else you wanted me to talk about out there alan well you have the floor um chris commissioner magnara was wondering if uh manufactured home replacement was included in both scenarios or not saw that i was typing her message but i can definitely uh speak to it maybe a little bit quicker um so so you as you notice there you or you may notice there that there is an action called resident retrofits of a residential and so these these were deep residential retrofits that we that we modeled um pretty much i think almost 100 of the buildings um i can't remember off the top i don't think it was quite 100 um by 2040 and so that would be covering a wide like across all the different building stocks uh in oregon so even though we didn't explicitly kind of single out manufacturer homes as a single part of the wedge um that action would include either kind of a home replacement or you know a significant upgrade to that to that structure or to that mobile home uh or manufacturing home so um it would be kind of kind of included in in that action although not explicitly separated right but you could because you do know the building stocks across the state we could look at this a little more a little more granularity if we wanted to yeah we could definitely do a deeper and then uh my question from a non-commissioner but about whether the tax credits in the inflation reduction act especially for commercial buildings would affect the net cost of the two items on the right at least retrofits in commercial i don't that we have been we have not included the provisions of the ira and in modeling um as we've discussed at our last meeting our intent is to update the projections as new programs come online and we and we hope to be able to get resources to be able to do follow-on modeling to keep this work really current so we have kind of as much as we can of real-time real-time information about how the how the programs are going to work and then angus has a long question maybe i'll just if you have do you have um kathy can i add one more thing to the ira thing that you're talking about before we move on to angus's question which is the ira will certainly help us meet these goals all our what we're going to achieve through the goals that we have is is deeper reductions than what the ira is going to provide so we'll actually go we'll go beyond that um but all of the incentives and programs that will come out of ira will will help us meet our goals so it'll help us meet the hb 2021 and help us meet our cpp and all these different programs as well so it'll make it much easier for us to be able to get there linda is going to unmute you angus so you can ask your question hi kathy hi welcome hi and everybody first kathy i'd like to know how much you paid your i.t people for the capability to mute and unmute me at will because my wife would be interested it's a good business opportunity yeah exactly big one big one there might be a few others and and mike my question is not to challenge the results but to try to understand particularly the the issue of uh substituting electric heat pumps for um either resistance electric or gas heating systems and um cooling and and electric cooling systems separate cooling systems and whether the analysis looked at you know these kinds of sensitivities in trying to decide where to place uh electric heat pumps on the mac curve and i won't go through all of them and i'm not sure i captured all of them but um i expect your your consultants could look at those and just tell me whether those were incorporated or not yeah so i guess you know consider like so heating and cooling degree days are considered uh as projections as part of this by five different counties so the different counties will have different numbers uh or different values for heating and cooling so the ones on the east will be a little bit cooler than the ones on the west um um so so we do account for that we aren't this analysis is not at an hour level so we're not looking at kind of like different peaks for different uh different at different weather or different times of the year so that would change kind of the analysis a little bit more obviously you know more specific so we are just looking kind of a total annual which obviously is a limitation for doing a deeper dive into understanding energy needs um at that but we do account for the change in kind of weather or climate overall the demand for heat pumps would probably adjust uh the the scale scale cost or reduce the the cost we were being a little more conservative and keeping the cost kind of kind of constant because we don't really you know have you could say it could go up could say it could go down and both both arguments could be valid um but we're just kind of keeping it we're using the eia's uh projections around um heating and cooling equipment for both residential and and kind of non-residential spaces um so we're using that as our guide um and again yeah smart circuit boxes would allow for that more kind of hourly load and load management which again we're not really uh we're not really doing at this level of analysis but we could kind of apply that going forward if if uh somebody deemed to look deeper into that and i'm sorry chris are you looking at um the the cost benefit of being able to incorporate you know cooling uh in into a system for no extra cost versus existing systems where you know cool ac cooling is a a separate function and a a less efficient efficient one is a rule but that requires sort of projecting forward into into a a a weather a climate weather model where there are more hot days that uh heat events that need to be addressed uh but clearly we are already at least in the in the uh um the early",

        "text": ", or the applicant is actually requesting a b two, which is a community type designation, and we'll go over the projected uses in a few moments. However, this property is within the urban growth boundary. So it is. Municipal services are available to it. It's in the secondary springs protection zone, not in one of the primaries. As I mentioned before, it is a developing commercial corridor. If you look at the areas within this, you have b five, you have m two, you have m one, b five, and b four. You also have commerce district, which is directly north of the airport, and that industrial area, which is specifically meant to accommodate b four, b five, m one, m two. So not only is this a burgeoning commercial corridor, it's also for heavier uses. This is the 2035 City of Oak, Cal envisioning Plan. As I mentioned before, this is the airport at this location. The subject parcel is located immediately to the west of this area. Their plan did not immediately carry that far west because they did cut it off at the city boundaries. But you can see on this corridor that you have a number of areas that are designated at medium high. And with the uses that currently exist within the county, it would only be rational to think that those kind of uses are going to continue, at least on the north side of the road, while there have been some additional commercial developments that have occurred a little bit farther west. Staff findings as far as the land use amendment is concerned, it is compatible with the public interest. We have compared it to multiple elements of the comprehensive plan, which they were satisfactory, and also our transportation element 2.1.4. We find that it is compatible with the surrounding area and it is consistent with statutes. Staff is recommending approval of the small scale amendment, and now we'll move forward into the rezoning request. As I mentioned before, this is going to be from. They're requesting going from general agriculture to community business. This is one of the last remnant a one parcels that are actually in this area. There are a few left, however, the ones that are existing. This is the only site that actually maintains an zero eight exemption through the property appraiser, which that is the agricultural exemptions. The properties to the west, to the east and to the southwest no longer carry those exemptions. I'm sure they were probably used for agricultural purposes at one point because they do still carry a grazing designation on them. But the property to the west, which we'll see an aerial up here just a moment, seems to be unimproved at this time. It had a manufactured home on it, but the property is overgrown. Going back and checking aerials, it doesn't look like there's any kind of residential or agricultural activity that occurred or has occurred probably since about 2008, possibly 2004. The property to the immediate east is a residential development, and then the property that's designated a one to the southwest is heavily treed and it would not be suitable for the grazing. That is the grazing classification that it's designated with under the property appraiser. This is the a one designation that currently exists. This is the b two designation that is proposed to your right. The existing use map identifies this as a grazing area. I do have a photo on here. The southern portion of the property is continued to be used as grazing on this south of where the proposed land use amendment and the zoning change occurs are proposed. You can see this is the existing site now the top left, you can't really see too well, but those are cows back in the back. This is a manufactured home that is on site that was built in the seventies and is planned to be demolished. This is the area, a portion of the area that is planned to be rezoned and then immediately across the street. These are the WEC manufactured home modular home facilities that were put in place to accommodate that facility for residences for their workers. This is the property that is immediately adjacent to the west. As I mentioned before, this is. The opposition had actually come from this particular property. I don't know if there's anyone that will be speaking for this today. As I mentioned before, it was mentioned as a commercial farm. But our indications show that there's been no commercial activity or agricultural activity on it. Probably better than a decade. This, as I mentioned previously, we are within the urban growth boundary. We are in the secondary springs protection zone. We are outside of the farmland preservation area. Any development on this property will be required to hook up to municipal services. The owner has a number of recommended services that they are proposing. This is not something that we typically include with the rezoning, but we were given this information, so we wanted to make it available to this board as well. What they're proposing at this site is approximately 20,000 sqft for accommodation of a laundromat, a small grocery store, possibly a restaurant, a storage building to the south. Storage is allowed on this. I'm going to be clear about that. As long as it's internal, it is allowed on b two, and then as well as an ice kiosk, somewhere that would be located on the property. Staff is recommending approval. We find that it is consistent with all three conditions based on our analysis in comparison with the land development code and the comprehensive plan, we have any questions for staff? All right, is the applicant present? Good evening, Paolo. Master serial. Master Serial Engineering. 170 Southeast 32nd Place, Ocala, Florida, 34471. I appreciate Ken's analysis of this and description. He did a wonderful job. I mean, I think he's laid it out. So I'm here to answer any questions. Let's see what kind of opposition we have. Yes, sir. All right. Is there anyone else here who would like to speak in favor of this and any opposition? Anyone up in who would like to speak in opposition? You can come forward. State your name and address for the record. We'll let you speak and then we'll write it down. Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this issue? Okay, will you come up to this podium here, if you don't mind? Good afternoon, sir, and thank you for allowing me to speak today. Name and address? My name is Sherrietta Prince. I'm sorry? Sherrietta Prince. My address is 7402 West Highway 40, which is the property that is west that was shown in the picture. Any other questions before I begin, ma'am? You're good. Thank you, sir. Yes, we have. Our family has owned this property for the past 100 years. And it has all been zoned agriculture for the past nearly 100 years. And we would like to preserve the agricultural portion that is left that belongs to the family. Now, the picture that was shown of the property that's to the west is my property. That's a picture of the property that's got to be a year or two old. That property was zoned agriculture as recently as two years ago. So not more than ten years ago. So that's an old picture. During the off planting season. I do have pictures that I brought with me that show that we have fields of crop that are planted and that are this high now spring crop. So we are planting. We are doing agriculture there on the west side, also on the east side, it zoned agriculture. And when we just went through an heirs property issue, and this just came down to our generation of heirs just now, and it was zoned grazing, as the gentleman stated. And we are intended to continue the agriculture zoning. And we are preparing the land to do other than grazing because it's small enough now that we're going to do crop on that piece also. And we have prepared to do that. We're working on that, sir. And what we'd like to do is request preservation for us for the right to farm. And that if this is allowed, that there's a buffer between us and that property to preserve the farmland and to allow that the development not be a nuisance to us. And that once there are people actively on that site, if approved, that we not be a nuisance to them, but we like to protect them from. That's your two minutes. Stay right there because we may have a question or two for you. Do you want to explain any of that? Because I mean, the buffering will be required. There's no ifs, ands or buts about that. If the property is used as residential and agricultural, it will be a more intense buffer. It would be approximately 30ft wide. If it is solely used for agricultural, it will only be 5ft wide. So there's quite a bit of distance in that. I would be more than happy to speak with Miss Prince. I'm sure Mister Mastersario would also to get some additional information, give her additional information on what's going on with this. Probably that would come from Mister Massachario more so than me. But when we have a better idea of exactly what the intent of the family would be, I'm sure that staff will be more than happy to work with you to try and accommodate your concerns. There are minimum requirements, as I mentioned, for buffering and that depends on what you intend to use the property for. Basically, if you have somebody that's living on the property while you're farming it, you'll have a much wider buffer. If you just farm the property, those buffer requirements are more minimal. However, in talking with mister masters and the owners, there could be some accommodation for you in order to make some changes with that. All right, so 15ft or 30ft is what we're going to be looking at. 15 or ",

        "text": " to um how you see or you and your members see fsac and just as i i view f sex process as pretty tight with pretty tight timeline lines and uh to do the work this significant amount of work that needs to be done and how do your members see f sex process in terms of in light of the timeline that you just certainly focused on here today how do you see f sex uh timeline within that more comprehensive timeline that's a great question um i would say increasingly your assessment of it being pretty tight i think is increasingly an observation from what i'm hearing from our members because of those things that are taking longer after the site certificate so the off take the interconnection the questions around materials procurement you know finding all the labor and everything is getting all that done in the three years for start of the three years works if everything goes and so uh that that would be one observation general observation that i would share um for that and and sorry i should have i i view the tightness as for staff oh that too yeah to review and kind of get back to people and and if i'm not mistaken once that sector certificate is issued the timeline can be extended extended with an amendment you know um so hopefully that provides some flexibility to get that work done uh yeah i think the amendment does um although i would defer to staff on on the if that adds extra work for them um you know from the applicant standpoint i think it it does add extra uh work and cost i don't know if it's similar for staff when they have to review an amendment but um yeah no i i definitely appreciate the the uh tight timeline for the staff and the amount of work that they have to do for these applications okay thank you again thanks for being here today are there any other questions comments sure grill if i may i just want to let that all the comments play out so councilmember talk to us brought up one question about offshore um energy and so i just want to provide a little bit of comment about that um just i was thought somebody might somebody else might talk about that but but since they didn't i'll bring it up um so just to be clear anything offshore is not f-sect jurisdictional and that's why we typically don't have conversations about those types of facilities not that there have been any yet or beyond demonstration facilities but there is currently um some evaluations going on between or the state of oregon the state of california and the federal government for some pretty you know significant offshore wind in the future there's certainly a a desire you know i think by all parties that i just to have that and if it's beyond three miles offshore it would be federal jurisdiction if it's within three miles it's state jurisdiction but that is the department of state lands and not fsec so where that might trigger some connectivity to f-sec is if you did see a large wind energy facility likely that would also result in a pretty significant transmission line to get that to the power grid and that's that transmission line would very likely be our jurisdiction unless there's some change in in state or federal policy right now um it would likely be our jurisdiction but that would be the limit to our jurisdiction but you know um max and diane talked about sort of the we're likely to see you know a lot of new you know future projects uh the forecasting that we're looking at we're seeing the same thing that's in addition the potentially big offshore wind projects so i think it's at least in the forecast to try to you know get into you know 100 renewable or as close as we can it will include all of those elements and not just either offshore or onshore it'll be a combination of those two i know it's pretty generic but if council members want any more information on the work that's being on offshore when the department of energy is certainly part of that not us in within the sighting division but other parts of the department of energy are participating in that and we can certainly provide you some updates on that if you're interested thanks i'd quickly just add to that that oregon state university is uh by next year i understand we'll have a wave energy test facility up and running off about seven miles off the coast of thank you patrick any other comments other questions well then again i'll say thank you to max and diane for joining us today and we appreciate the information it was thorough and extremely helpful that will transition us to our last agenda item which is agenda item h the west end solar energy project hearing officer appointment we this is an action item and we have kellen tardy weather odo senior sighting analyst to walk us through this item madam chair we've got chase is stepping in for kellen who was unable to be here today so chase mcvay walker will be doing this presentation instead all right on hi chase maybe you're doing it time oh there let me put my hand down now okay okay well thank you for joining us and thanks for stepping up to handle this agenda item for us no problem okay i can figure this out okay well share my screen okay well can everyone hear me first of and are you able to see my slide screen and we'll get started good afternoon madden chair vice chair howe and members of the council for the record my name is chase mcvay walker senior signing analyst at the oregon department of energy item h this afternoon is a request to appoint a hearing officer for the proposed west end solar energy facility let me see okay i think this is good the agenda item will be rather brief and administrative as my presentation consists of only a few slides with that being said feel free to stop me at any point for questions on this agenda item and i can do the best of my ability to answer them the appointment of a hearing officer does require council action as uh chair stated so following my presentation we will need to have a motion and a vote on it west end solar energy project is a proposed 50 megawatt solar photovoltaic energy generation facility to be located in umatilla county two miles southeast of the city of hermiston within a site boundary of approximately 324 acres of exclusive farm use zoned land additionally as proposed there's going to be up to 70 megawatts of energy storage as part of this facility in a little brief uh procedural history the department received a request for expedited review from the applicant on december 11 2020 and then received the preliminary application for site certificate in november of 2021 the department then issued an expedited review project order on february 10 and is currently reviewing the pasc or preliminary application for site certificate for completeness following the completeness review the department will issue the draft proposed order and hold a public hearing on the or draft proposed order which it to occur in 2022 the dpo public hearing will require a hearing officer to run the hearing and this is a map locational map for the proposed west end solar energy project and if you can see my cursor which is a tiny white arrow right in the middle is a purple box and that is the proposed location of this energy facility two miles approximately two miles southeast of the city of hermiston the oregon office of administrative hearings or oah provides an independent and impartial forum for citizens and businesses to to dispute state agency actions and it also employs 65 professional administrative law judges or aljs that are utilized by approximately 70 state agencies however odo and fsec are not legally required to utilize oah since 2017 however fsec has exclusively used oah aljs as hearing officers in the list uh following the last bullet on this slide below shows the last seven projects that have featured an the department has coordinated with our counterparts at oah for a recommendation of a hearing officer for the west end solar energy project oah has recommended administrative law judge miss allison green webster to be appointed as the hearing officer for the west end solar energy project the staff report for this agenda item agenda item h provides a short bio on alj green webster and includes some of her relevant history including her current and previous f-sec most recently miss green webster served as the hearing hearings officer for the boardman solar energy facility proceedings which occurred in 2017 and and she is currently serving as the hearing officer presiding over the contested case proceedings for the boardman to hemingway transmission line additionally miss greenwebster also presides over hearings for the city of portland fire and police disability and retirement fund she has been a presenter at administrative law conferences and the oregon dui multi-disciplinary impaired driving training conference she is a trainer and peer reviewer for other administrative law judges and has a bachelor's degree in communications from ucla she received her jd from loyola law school in los angeles prior to joining the oregon office of administrative hearings ms greene webster worked as staff attorney for the oregon workers compensation board before that she spent several years in private practice in both oregon and miss greenwebster is a member of the oregon state bar and the state bar of california and that leads me to staff's and staff's recommendation to council this afternoon is to appoint alj green or allison green webster as the hearing officer for the west end solar energy project and if you have any further questions i'd be happy to feel them at this point or any questions period i'd be happy to feel them at this point and if not thank you chief yes it works uh thank you are there any questions for madam chair this is kent i'll move the council appoint administrative logic allison green webster from the oregon office of administrative hearings as a hearing officer for the proceedings for the west end solar project as recommended by staff thank you we have a motion and a second there any further discussion hearing none mr secretary please call the role hillary jenkins perry chalk dude kent howe marcy grill cindy condon yes motion carries madam chair thank you mr secretary chase thank you handling that presenting and we appreciate your assistance that is our last agenda item are there any further things that mr secretary you need to communicate to council yes thank you madam chair one one follow-up item so um so chris reminded me that we already actually do have a bond letter of credit rule-making uh agenda item or",

secretary report Flor is yours thank you chair um first our council member updates so Katie IMS was confirmed by the full Senate on February 9th in her first term uh of the energy facility sting Council officially started on February 16th so welcome council member IMS on behalf of the staff we thank you for volunteering your time what we do is incredibly important important and your role is um the at the decision making side of that is incredibly important as well so welcome thank you Todd I appreciate that chair Vice chair members of the camp I just want to take this opportunity May on okay um this opportunity to say um I'm very excited to be here and um I look forward to serving alongside you and um I understand I have a lot to learn and U but I look forward it's been a very welcoming um on boarding everybody's been very um gracious and so just appreciate that and leave at that thank you thank you and welcome and we forward to working with you also in terms council member updates uh council member Cho Toot's first term in on March 15th of this year um council member Chu has submitted requests to the governor's office for reappointment um so moving forward on that process um as you know you know It ultimately result the legislative process has to go in front of the Senate rules committee and be voted on by the full senate for confirmations outside of a legislative session they schedule those at varying times we believe the next legislative dat would be in April that's and thank you council member chaku for your continuing service and your willingness to continue into a second term so we very much appreciate yes on behalf this is chair bra on behalf of all of us we appreciate it you bring a unique perspective to us and we are glad that you're staying on thank you okay I'm G move on to project updates first is the Summit Ridge wind farm so this project is an approved wind energy generation facility it's located in northeastern Wasco County County it's been approved for 72 wind turbin with a peak generating capacity of 194 megaw it was originally approved in 2011 since then there have been five approved amendments and there is the sixth which is currently under review these amendments uh have related to varying things including change of ownership time extension beginning and ending construction time extension requests um as well as one which is proposing to add solar PV and battery storage to the project as well um the project has uh been appealed uh in a couple of different uh Ways by the friends of Columbia River cge uh to Circuit Court those have been going on for some time U and those relate to the denial and contested case on one of the Amendments as well as sort of the status whether stat project is actually active or nonactive so on February 14th we received a request to decommission the facility terminate the site certificate as well as withdraw amendment number six so the decom conditioning request requires a notice and a public comment period we have not yet sent out that notice to the public establishing a public comment so that will be in front of you um whether it's March or April it will be coming to you at some so we're starting just beginning in that process um following on that even though that project is not yet been terminated um the same applicant or developer um has submitted a notice of intent for a new project which is the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility functionally it is the same project as the approval through amendment number five as well as what they're proposing in amendment number six so they're they're effectively resetting project that would include 32 wind turbines equaling 201 megaw solar area equaling 60 megaw and battery storage equaling 21 megawatts that came in relatively recent we have set up a website the notice of intent is located on the website but as part of the notice of intent process we have to provide notice to the public reviewing agencies and see comment we've not yet done that um we will also have a public informational meeting uh We've not yet set that either so that will be Council question about is that a strategy that does away with all the activity and then we just start from I'm just curious what what's behind it in terms of uh the activity so far and then going forward well I'm not really inclined to speak for the certificate holder or this case the applicant but on its face that appears to be what's happening I guess from from our position we'll get a new S for S that starts a new we know about a lot of that work um but the analysis is still the same um or similar yes you know in that assuming all of the standards or requirements are all exactly the same in terms of all of the characteristics and facts on the ground are all the same um it would be largely the same you know but things Chang you know this originally was approved in 2011 there has been multiple amendments but you know it's also an opportunity you know we know in this area but for example in other areas in the Columbia Plateau Washington ground squirrel migrate you know and move into new areas and we've had where project has been approved um taken several years to go into construction and by the time they did Washington ground srel had moved into that area which then eliminated their ability to develop half of the project now I don't know if there's any circumstances like that in this area of this project but that's where new information is valuable to assure that everything is the same we don't we don't assume it is we have to valuate the facts thank you um next is the Boardman solar energy facility this is an approved 75 megawatt solar energy project on 790 Acres located in North moral County uh was originally approved in early 2018 with a deadline to begin Construction in February of 20121 council approved amendment number one allowing a three-year time extension um for the beginning of construction which ends today um certificate aler stated that they will not be seeking another time extension or let the site certificate expire um they've indicated that they will be seeking County approval instead uh if you recall last uh last legislative session there was a change in jurisdictional thresholds about what go to counties um and they're going to be seeking um to have this project permitted by the county instead next is the cardi Generating Station so this is Project is located in moral County uh not too far from City of Boardman it consists of two two components um it's an an operational 450 megawatt combined cycle natural gas field electrical generating plant and that was approved originally in 2012 and it's been constructed and operated they they did have a another unit that was proved that they didn't build Ander valid um they also had requested under amendment number one 50 megawatt solar PB facility um so I don't know picture the location but you have the cardi Generating Station then across the street was the bman coal plant then there is a big retention pond water area it was related to the P coal plant and south of that was where the um solar facility was approved so the solar facility was approved in 2018 not yet constructed they requested time extension begin construction through 2025 is their February 2025 will be their new timeline to begin construction earlier this month we received amendment number four requesting to increase the solar components from 50 megawatts to 1885 megawatts and adding 156 megawatt of battery storage um I don't had not looked at the details I believe um a lot of that new area would be on the site of the Ord next on my list is the Muddy Creek project so at the last council meeting we spent some time providing comments that were submitted directly to some council members um and we talked about those comments were outside public comment period since they were specific to a couple council members um it was important that we provided those to all council members as as well as the applicant to make sure you know that there are no procedurals associated with project um so we did that um think that was exactly what needed to be done and then lingering question um that was asked by council member was uh council members was were those comments part of the decision record or not and um our doj Council Patrick grow indicated that he would do a little more research and come back to council and provide you with that information as to whether that constituted being part of the decision record or not an alternative to Patrick to respon so as we discussed at the last meeting there's uh the difficulty that comments made separately to council members poses there's at least two difficulties that that poses one the it's uh the applicant has not had you're the decision makers uh In fairness the applicant needs to be able to review and respond and provide their input would need to if they were to be made part of the decision making record uh and second from an administrative standpoint it's difficult for staff uh if you were to get a lot of those types of comments whether they be provided to you separately uh as they were last month or if they were were to be provided just as part of public comments during one of your regular meetings if those comments had to be part of the decision making record staff would then have to keep track of that make sure they got into the record and also allow the applicant to respond to those comments we have a process that's in place right now for comments Project Specific comments there are two opportunities one is through the when the the notice intent is issued the public is given an opportunity those comments are made part of your decisionmaking record and then of course on the draft proposed order public comments Project Specific comments are made part of the record the applicant is given an opportunity to respond staff evaluates and provides you their input uh there is nothing in your rules that requires separate comments made uh comments made separately to you or comment made during the course of a public meeting one of your regular meetings that requires you to make those part of the decision making uh I want to point out that Oregon public meetings Law requires that the public be able to observe and monitor public meetings there's nothing in Oregon public meetings law that requires you to accept public comments during a meeting you have a rule FC itself",

        "text": " on a possible project out here in forest grove that would involve um upwards up to about 400 kw of community solar but our project would involve us um taking all the production credits and pushing them back into our low-income uh assistance program serving all of our customers that qualify for that program would that uh under the direction you have now would that qualify for as part of the this grant funding for direct energy cost savings to our families and small businesses from that language does that seem like that would rob um yeah definitely so the eligibility requirements are are pretty straightforward that there's technology eligibility and that has to essentially just be a renewable energy technology so 400 kilowatts of solar apply without question or would be eligible without question and then the the other eligibility requirement has to do with the actual applicant and so as long as the applicant was either you as the utility or some other public body that would make the applicant eligible and the way in which the benefits flow back to low-income members of the community would help it to score points within the competitive review process so yeah it sounds to me like it would be an eligible project that would do well in the program all right thank you rob charlie let's try again you're off mute you should be able to speak now can you hear me all right great um thanks uh and thanks for everything you guys are doing on this uh it's it's a really neat uh program um one of the we've we've got a project our community solar project that we're planning to build uh kind of late fall this year and it's starting to look like uh supply chain constraints are going to make it so that we have to uh start ordering materials uh soon we'd still like to be eligible for the grant and i'm wondering how you guys will handle you know any kind of uh costs that happen before you know you know before award i guess um can they count as the 50 or or is it does everything have to wait until after the award james do you want to take that one maybe yes um so eligible costs to be funded by the grant will only be those that are incurred after the application deadline and i just wanted to we'll check our definition of the project costs so the project costs will be the costs um incurred by the applicant as a whole so that is um just like the whole project for the renewable energy system but the only eligible costs will be those incurred after the um application deadline does that kind of make sense uh i think so so you're saying that if if it's all possible you know we would wait until after as it was june 10th to expend those funds for those funds you're hoping to claim uh by the grant yes okay so yeah and i think we have a really related question to um charlie you can stay off and did you want to follow up at all before i michelle had a question which was well projects that have already started purchasing materials or began prior to completing the application potentially qualify and i think well i should but it's the answer to that yes but those costs would not be reimbursable is that correct um so it's kind of how the rules have been written um in that the cost the project's still eligible but only those costs incurred after the application deadline would be um eligible costs for the grant um to be to fund for the grant funding to be used on roger just one thing and i think i think charlie mentioned that the for a renewable energy only project that's a constructive project the grant is only able to cover 50 of the funds and so i think the part of the question was getting to you know those funds that are expended prior to the grant deadline could those be counted in 50 of funds that are provided by the you not as necessarily as match but um as those funds that can't be reimbursed by the grant and therefore you know if you were starting a project now and incurred some costs anything that you purchased now i think would not be reimbursable but potentially could count as the 50 of project cost and i'm not sure i wanted to just clarify with james how we think about that um would those be eligible to count as the 50 of project cost that the local you you know that the partner is yes as we got it written in the rules that would uh that would be count but the funds expended could be included in that kind of total project cost but our funding would only be able to cover those costs that are expended after uh the application deadline so thanks for that clarification rob does that help charlie yeah i think that answers the question and and so um so long as we didn't spend you know uh beyond 50 we might still be in a position to to reap the benefit of the um of the funding okay and and that's that's how i see it at least at this point as we wouldn't we wouldn't be exceeding that so um so that uh that helps thank you and i think leah's question just got answered as we were chatting about can you use incurred costs before the application deadline for the matching portion for that matching portion for clean energy projects that then the answer i think is yes right yes and it's not like it corrects me if i'm wrong but it's not like precisely a dollar for dollar match it's just we can cover up to 50 of the cost for it for it all right any other questions any other i don't see any other hands raised nothing in the chat this is usually the time where like five questions come in at once uh keith i'll let you know when you're off mute all right you should be good thank you yeah keith horman again city force grove lighting power hey um does as part of that 50 match does in kind work done by the utility constitute a portion of that is it all just financial 50 percent um so i'm just looking at the precise language because we have um some language in our roles not covering kind of staffing costs that uh kind of would be covered in the ordinary um kind of work processes of the the project sort of thing all the the the organization i should say that's in the statute actually it's in the rules and the statute yeah yeah so if it's like if you hire a consultant or something like that that could be covered but staff for its existing staffing costs that's the limits that okay so you mean like we couldn't construct portions of the project or prep work that would not count towards it then our own crews i think that's correct we can keep we'll look into that to make sure because i think things like the could be covered you know but i think it's just the actual staff time it's like if it's an existing staff that seems like the statute was trying to dissuade against that gotcha okay thank you all right jennifer has her hand up go ahead jennifer um point with community solar um if there was storage added to something like that would that be considered a resilience project and be eligible for 100 or is a community solar project always going to be a just a renewable so adding storage to community solar could definitely turn a project into a resilience project so long as that storage was serving some community resilience function and so yeah definitely i think that we'll probably see more and more community solar projects adding storage for exactly that reason and within the competitive reviewing so you know there will be an evaluation of just how much resilience benefit is brought to the community through the project and so um you know a project that's a community space a library a fire hall things like this are really clear uh but if it's a you know a small battery that's just providing you know enough backup to charge some cell phones in in one location that probably won't score as but certainly adding batteries to community solar brings a project over into the side of the the projects and that's a 100 um reimbursement under the statute then okay thank you thank you jennifer all right tucker um i'll let you know when you're off mute with where jennifer was taking that there you go we can hear you now tucker can you hear me yeah okay better i'm just trying to follow up with where uh jennifer was taking that that question and just trying to better understand the resiliency side of this is i'm in the community working with community partners and they're gonna ask questions about kind of what resiliency means and another interest too and things like electric vehicle chargers and that sort of stuff is that rolls out kind of from the federal side so if you solar into an ev charging station or stall does that is that something that would qualify here too just from the transportation sector and kind of the importance of that for resiliency and whatnot by the way i appreciate you guys entertaining that oh yeah yeah no problem tucker and i owe you a phone call too i catching up for my vacation but i saw that you're in my voicemail uh rob do you want to take that one sure yeah so again if there's a if you can make the case that the solar part of the system is able to provide power to those charging stations in the event of a grid power outage it would be providing resilience benefits and we recognize the value of you know in the event of an emergency that could be very valuable resilience benefit to a community to have a fleet of vehicles that don't need when all the pumps at the gas stations are down you know that's potentially a very good resilience benefit but it would just have to be designed and constructed in such a way where the solar was able to provide you know charging to the to the station when the when the grid was down um one one follow-up to that just to understand what this project covers if you're if you're to do a project with multiple components like that where you're you know you're including ev charging or anything of that nature does it just cover the the actual power production itself you know in the solar array or wind energy or whatever or does it also cover the cost of your electric vehicle chargers and that and that piece of it electric vehicle charging infrastructure is eligible and i may kick it over to james if there's any specific reference to that but within the statute it calls that out as an eligible cost and so charging stations yes but thinking the vehicles no yeah yeah makes sense okay thank you great thanks tucker anybody else have any questions",

        "text": " out there looking at rto formation across the west of course plenty of them are inclusive of oregon the questions have been raised around whether there is a need to specifically look at any technical analysis of trying to project the benefits to oregon in particular so that's what this question was really trying to get at are you know are there reasons to believe why these benefits may be greater or lesser in oregon in particular you know separate from those regional evaluations that are out there so some of the feedback we got here general feedback i think most but not all commenters seem to generally agree um with the literature that regional integration and coordination can reduce system costs as a very high level general comment one commenter certainly uh suggested however that the complexities of modeling the existing bilateral system may result in technical studies of rto formation that could actually overestimate the benefits compared to the status quo i saw some other comments and certainly i i've seen in some of the studies out there suggesting the opposite that the potential to underestimate so there's definitely a range of perspectives there and in some cases it's been pointed out the cost may simply simply be shifting from one customer group to another i think we've already heard some of this feedback during the workshop today multiple commenters urged a collaborative process with regional stakeholders to ensure costs and benefits are allocated equitably across the region as opposed to an exclusive focus on a single state so i think certainly that's most of it most of the efforts out there have been looking regionally to date and then also this is also come up today there may be complications with estimating state-specific benefits due to the physical regional interconnectedness of the grid all that notwithstanding uh there were plenty of comments on some potential opportunities for oregon specific one commenter noted as a result of oregon's reliance on thermal resources compared to say its neighbor in washington it's more likely that oregon consumers would see net benefits from an uh at a potential exporter of clean energy or even to benefit from lower wheeling charges across the region as a result of rto formation and multiple commenters expect that access to more diverse resources across the broader footprint to serve in-state load would benefit oregon and then in terms of oregon specific the potential was identified for a reversion to the mean across the region with customers who currently pay less for power and transmission such as many in oregon ending up paying more while customers who currently pay more uh such as in the kaiso might end up paying less as prices converge all right so universe uh kind of related to that uniform transmission costs for example was identified as one area in particular where this could adversely impact oregon customers and one commenter noticed that in low hydro years in particular oregon customers could be more exposed to greater rate variability driven by increased dispatch of resources with a fuel cost i feel inclined to stop on this page before moving on to the rest of question two to see if there's any feedback midway before i keep going but i'm happy to go through the rest of the feedback for question two and then talk all at once again like we did before okay i will keep going uh so some some other potential oregon specific concerns that were highlighted uh local control concerns were identified about diluting the value of local control particularly with consumer if they were to join a regional rto with load-based governance structure transmission congestion there's a perception that oregon quote experiences relatively little transmission and that a well-designed rto should mitigate against inequitably shifting costs to oregon customers to relieve transmission congestion outside of oregon out of market actions uh one commenter noted rtos often supplement their markets with out-of-market capacity mechanisms to ensure sufficient capacity well the status quo in the region may offer a more efficient and certain mechanism for doing this and then in terms of we asked a specific question about at least one commenter expressed that they were not aware of any specific risks to underserved and low-income communities associated specifically with rto formation and it was noted by another that out-of-market processes may evolve to address specific considerations for underserved and low-income communities where the design of an rto administered market optimization may not be the appropriate mechanism adam can i ask a question about the second bullet under the other potential concerns transmission congestion there's a perception that oregon experiences relatively little transmission and then a well-designed rto should mitigate against an equally shifting cost to oregon customers to relieve transmission congestion i i'm a little lost on this one to be honest i mean my initial response here is that an rto is not designed to shift costs from one state or transmission congestion from one state to another so i i don't know i'm just hoping somebody could shed light on what the concern is here and and i mean i haven't talked to anyone that thinks oregon doesn't experience transmission congestion thank you nicole i i would open that up if anyone has feedback uh you know i sort of uh neutralized the phrasing of these comments so i didn't associate them on the screen here with particular commenters but certainly some of these comments uh came from a particular set of comments so someone may recognize the comments and uh uh wish to clarify or add some more information but i mean did someone want to speak sorry i guess one comment i would just add here is that i mean the idea of a sort of regional transmission planning and and you know energy dispatch market not the idea behind it but one of the benefits of it is you have a much better understanding of where the transmission congestion is on a regional basis sort of sends the price signals to the places where we need the relief the most and should that situation identify that there's more congestion in like let's say oregon versus another place the idea wouldn't be that all of a sudden oregon has to pay for all those additional upgrades that are needed to that system the idea would be that those costs and that investment is spread out over the entire market so i guess i just want to make sure that's kind of understood and maybe maybe someone could correct me if i'm wrong there this this isn't from the opuc's comments but i'll just reflect that i think what what i sometimes hear when i'm in regulator is a sense that that's spreading out my customers will pay for an upgrade somewhere else that doesn't directly benefit them and that they wouldn't have had to pay for if i wasn't in an rto so i think that's that perception now the flip is also true right if if oregon is congested then the upgrade costs are peanut buttered across more customers so i think there's if i had to guess it's not my comments but what i hear in other forums would lead me to think that's the sense of the concern and that's why from my perspective those questions about governance and ongoing discussions about cost allocation you don't see an iso or an rto in the country that has finished their cost allocation discussions for that reason thank you litha that's very helpful and i think that also points to this first bullet where it talks about that that you're losing the value of a local control i mean this is more on we're talking about transmission but with a load-based governance structure i just want to point out that there are other options out there besides just a load-based governance structure and for those who don't know what that would mean that would be basically your your ability to provide um input or have a say in the governance structure would be directly tied to the number of customers you have or the size of your load and there are other models out there and like litha said they're still kind of working on details of a lot of this cost allocation issue um across different markets so much to be learned here hey nicole this is frank um it i'm i think that was eweb's comment um related to transmission congestion not not that we don't think there's not transmission congestion in oregon i think it was actually as commissioner tawny described it was a socialization of costs if you're in a good position entering an rto versus in a challenged position there can be a perception that you're going to be sort of pulled up or pulled down and so that that was the basis of the comment not necessarily specific to oh there's there's no i think it does get back to the importance of of some of you know how the market gets designed the government the governance in particular and how that works it really just i think we were trying to point out the the importance of that so that's just a little clarification on where that came thanks frank i appreciate that thank you frank adam this is robert i think the second half of that statement as frank alluded to really is the essence of the comet a well-designed rto should mitigate the problems that are raised so i wanted to ask a follow-up question i'm happy to talk about that issue but the out-of-market actions um you know there's a lot of discussion nationally frankly about sort of the you know i'm curious to get perspectives from the advisory committee on you know does an rto need to solve all of our problems or can we are we comfortable with the need for out-of-market actions for things like capacity planning and which happens in most rtos i i you know what i um i suppose when i think about rtos and read the literature i don't expect an rto to be designed to sufficiently procure and plan for capacity needs i see it as uh typically they're designed to efficiently dispatch the resources that are there as cost-effectively as possible so i'm just curious if there's any more discussion on that point sort of how much of a what are the perspectives there on you know the need for out-of-market capacity planning is that how much of a barrier is that hey adam it's sarah i'm just going to take a general approach to your question and not necessarily go on a deep dive on ra capacity or capacity markets per se but i think the answer at least for me generally is i really hope that we don't want the market to solve all of our problems because we will never get uh we just will never get there um there are some things that make sense to embed in the market particularly those items that respond best to you know the economic signals of supply and demand there are some more difficult things that have made sense in other places to do out of market uh particularly if there's a variance among states about how to do certain and",

whole motion right now or is there need to be a second oh no go ahead and make a motion Mr chair I move the council find that Miss Wendy King properly raised the issue of compliance with the cumulative effects standard for wind energy facilities regarding visual impacts of nighttime Aviation safety Lighting on the record of the draft proposed order public hearing with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to the Mr chair I further move that the council Deni the request for a contested Case by Miss Wendy King on the aforementioned issue because as recommended in the staff report while the issue is within the jurisdiction of the council it is not an issue or fact or law reasonably likely to affect the council's determination whether the facility With The Changes proposed by the amendment meets applicable laws and Council standards okay we've got a motion do we have a second this is Marcy I second motion okay thank you um got a motion in a second secretary cornet could you please call the role Richard Dublin I kenal yes Cindy Condon yes yes Marcy yes Kitty yes and buer yes motion carries Mr chair okay thankk you um okay so uh having denied the request for contested case the council does have the opportunity to um make your final decision on the proposed order and this as far as I understand you do have the authority to um make changes to the proposed order on your own motion if you do so those changes would be subject to a material changes hearing as we've kind of noticed in this agenda um I haven't prepared anything specifically obviously because we don't know what you might want to discuss but you do have that opportunity um before you do deliberate I'll just revite you that your duty now is to reevaluate review evaluate and issue the orders uh approving and denying applications and request for Amendment um and then issue site certificates and amended site certificates um and to do that you must determine that the proposed facility complies with all applicable Council standards um and then all other statutes and administrative rules identified by the project order as amended um uh and this is more specific to the ASC process but uh the general standard Remains the Same um in the proposed order the department has recommended that uh the facility again with the proposed new existing and amended conditions um does comply with all applicable standards and state laws and rules um and that we do recommend that you approve the proposed order and I guess if you could go to the slide um so we do recommend that you approve the proposed order as the final order um your other options as I mentioned would be to um make modifications to the final order and have a a material changes hearing um or you can reject the proposed order and explain the basis for it okay thank you do we have a motion yes um councelor delin thank you Mr chairman Mr chair I move that the council adopt the proposed order as the final order and issue the first amended size certificate for Wheatridge East Amendment East as presented and recommended by staff okay we have a motion is there a second Mr chair this is Marcy gr I second that motion okay got the motion in a second uh secretary corette could you please call the role before we do that can I just have a little bit of discussion sure um one of the things I struggled with and I actually uh talked to um Dr grette about um that is I did struggle with um the extension of the construction and part of it is due to it's a complicated project because of the splits that happened and the assertion or the the decision that construction had started and so the extension was appropriate the extension for um time was appropriate not sure I would have done it that way but um or thought of it that way but I am curious um are they subject to two two extensions for constru for completion what what where are we in the process right now so I'm a little has hesitant to I'll do I'll do my best so for the approved area which is you know up towards the top of the facility I believe they are getting their first extension with this decision and they would be eligible for one more if I I I believe that's correct if the limitation in the rule applies um and that's where I'm having a hard time just remembering without going back um for the new sections this would be like a new deadline and they would I believe be able to request two more extensions for the the new areas but we're not um but construction is deemed to have started on this project and so it's only completion that I understood we were so and and the way that we we went back and looked at the rule and and when the rule changed in 2018 there's an applicability Clause that kind of makes this a little more complicated which is why we ended up with two sets of deadlines um in part but so they they do just have one more construction they have just a construction completion deadline and sorry if I misstated that just before I'm like a little bit talking without thinking but um yeah so they have a completion construction completion part for the previously approved components um they were determined to have already started construction of that those previously approved components because they started construction of the wiid facility before this was split up right where everything that's newly added they do have a new construction commencement deadline as well as a completion deadline that would be triggered 3 years after whenever they start construction um so they yeah both they have to start construction within three years of the new stuff they they have to complete construction three years after of the new stuff they have to complete construction of what was previously approved within three years right and just to be clear they don't have to complete it because there is an opportunity for extension right they could come and the reason I um rais the issue uh for discussion is I think we may see more and splits of projects and um I guess I would like more discussion of that and how they are treated having started construction you know on the larger facility and then the split recognizing that started construction U business so um doesn't really affect how I'm going to vote here but um I did struggle with this A bit thank you okay please call R secretary KET Katie IMS yes Richard delin hi Kent how yes Cindy Condon yes Anne berer yes Marcy Grail yes motion carries Mr chair okay we're running about an hour and a half late um and we need a break I need a break um so let's take 10 though it's uh we come back at 10: 11 okay um it's 1110 we're back from a quick break the next item is public this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment including the Wheat Ridge East request for Amendment one draft proposed order and the Leaning Juniper 2A request for Amendment three draft proposed order so um do we have anybody in the audience that uh wants to provide comments ment and then do we do we have anybody on the phone or WebEx that wants to provide comment there are no hands raised at this time we will reiterate that after okay checking we'll check again okay so Miss Gilbert um yes thank you for give you a bit here like 15 or so oh oh minutes I only need a couple of minutes today sounds good um let's see u m I wanted to comment on there was some discussion about the council not having any kind of definition for significant and um and this is just but uh I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that division one does have a definition for significant and so when you're looking at and it really kind of encompasses a cumulative impacts kind of thing it talks about duration magnetude intensity and uh basically significance of the impacts so that really does accommodate um an opportunity to decide that something is going to be significant and and I think that um you should just be aware of that in the future when you are evaluating go back to division one and and what that definition is because it basically is the same as the legal definition which is kind of where I started with uh trying to figure out what significant is and I think if you look at some of the um um draft proposed orders there it's defined in where in those orders where you're deciding that there's no significant impact it really talks about what is significant so that you can make that decision um that was the main thing I wanted to bring up and the one other thing is there seems to be a lot of discussion and concern about whether or not any decision you make is going to cause a precedent and your decisions are sight specific so I think that you know that focus on whether or not because you allow one thing to happen in one instance that automatically is going to mean that future requests are going to end up with having the same result is is uh pretty unreasonable you are you're here to make decisions if that if it were as simple as that um your rules would just say everybody gets this um and one size doesn't fit all and so uh you're basically supposed to be justifying the decision that you make and that doesn't mean that the decision is always going to be the same so um I think it tends to to move you in a direction of denial when it may not necessarily be the right decision in the instance that you're evaluating so I I'd encourage you to not get all hung up on precedent setting those were the only comments that I had today thank you thank you very much M Gilbert no one else is in the room to give comment and let's just check one more time the phone and the web act Wendy King does have her hand raised Wendy I'm gonna unmute your mic and you will be ready to make a comment Miss King oops just unmuted Wendy okay thank you um I just wanted to share that I appreciate the careful deliberations all of my requests for a contested case I'm uh disappointed that none of them made the threshold for a contested case I um I was unaware that I had to um present all my materials",

grouped in the realm of leveraging federal dollars so if we if we are part of a program or know of a program or a grant that will leverage say one to two or one to four um federal dollars we need to note that because we don't certainly don't want to leave any money on the table absolutely you mentioned a few minutes ago our upcoming meeting with our commission that will take place at the end of next week in Lebanon um will'll be meeting April 25 and 26 with them and part of the discussion that we're going to have with them in that meeting is their to get their put on how process-wise how they would like for us to prioritize if we have a very tiny ask and very big ideas and lots of need um you know what what would they put at the top of the criteria list presumably um climate change and resiliency um housing production for us of course Equity um and so we are trying to get some input from them and would invite folks who are interested in chiming in to provide not only public comment for that time period for that meeting but specifically around how should we one go about prioritizing um when we have very little probably resources to to um secure as part of process thank you for the added context director baitman it's really helpful um Madam chair can I ask a question absolutely yes Brenda following up on that um very very useful information um presumably that you know let's say 1% net increase for really good ideas um could be higher if it's if you're looking at um a cut somewhere else right I mean there could be reductions you know a program that maybe is you know less crucial than this new program that you want to do so you know where there was a you know a reduction elsewhere that could be packaged together together with an increase that could be above 1% right that's correct in fact um I think ideas that end up being Revenue neutral because they've been paired with something else or because they've been creatively structured or maybe partnered with another agency um those are very well received and and often of course are more successful if you can demonstrate um a savings or um a a greater efficiency in the process that's that's good great I look forward to it thank you so dumo other comments questions I had a comment chair McDonald that that one% guidance 1% on general fund I think that's across the board from from the governor's office not just on the agencies present here and so that's just a a little con FYI thank Youk uh chair McDonald I I would just add um I think you know one of the things at Oda we're running a little behind uh because of the transition and so we're still working on our strategic plan um and how to align that with our budget ask uh knowing that we have a pretty small amount of money when you talk 1% of our general fund um in this agency and then uh some really key core programs that are important to oregonians uh in terms of natural resource stewardship uh water quality and food safety and consumer protection quickly have very little in terms of things that are unobligated um and we're we're really concerned in in assuring that we continue to hold the foundation and we need to do some work like internally around our it infrastructure and other things to bring it up to speed to be able to provide the services going forward that oregonians expect um on a on a crumbling infrastructure thank you appreciate that acting director Pig um thank you I just wanted to mention that due to the um the instructions director bitman mentioned we've already taken some of the pops off the list that is linked on this slide and so our our request is ever evolving and uh we're we're consolidating and prioritizing to make sure we stay within the instructions thank you that's helpful other comments right thank you um and um good to be to have this uh a lot of resources in one place and uh information that can hopefully help uh folks know how to engage in the process and um and try and make sure that important climate programs are being Advanced so thank you um chair chair McDonald just yes real quickly just wanted to note I will take the information from these slides I will add the information that I recently received from other agencies and I'll compile it all into a single document that will be uploaded to the commission's web page appr appreciate that Amy thank you very much great um well with that we'll go ahead and move on to um our next agenda item which is um thinking about our meetings uh that are coming up um and um some changes to the meeting dates but also then thinking about what are some of the priority topics that we want to make sure we are engaging in um after we settled on the dates for the um for the meetings we discovered that uh there's a mandatory director meeting with the governor um on that overlapped with several of the dates that we had selected so um the the May meeting was one of those and given that we didn't have very much time we just uh decided that we needed to cancel the May meeting and then we're looking at some of the meetings that are further out and trying to look at how we might reschedule the meeting um to make sure that some of the assignments that we uh have in front of us um that that the commission will have enough meeting time to to get together and and dig into those so this is our new um schedule and I think it is going to be a stable schedule um so we'll we'll stick to this um and what I wanted to do is just do do some brainstorming today about topics um that um people feel like are timely and important for the commission and uh to discuss and where appropriate to act on um and uh I went back and kind of walk back through all the things that we identified as part of the developing the road map um and then looked back at the natural and working lands proposal and then considered some of the assignments that we have uh for on our plates in terms of uh things that we need to to get done in the coming year and so I kind that was a good process for me to um think about what we should be putting in front of the commission um with the with the um dates for the meeting kind of scheduled out in front of us and um some input on the agendas we hope to do a better job of reaching out to agencies and and to other invited guests um earlier so people can get it on their schedules and we can and we can really kind of plan our our coming year or so out so just want to open things up and um would love to hear from agency directors and Commissioners um from our um legislative members you know what topics uh you'd like to um to make sure we get on our agenda for the coming year or so I know we talked quite a bit about uh Transportation being one of those topics that's going to um be front and center in the next um in the legislative session next next year so that's probably a broad topic area there may be subcategories underneath that um but that I'll just open the floor up um maybe we could take the slide down and then we could just um go ahead and people can raise their hand and brainstorm about topics one that came up earlier today um resilience and Equity are the two two um kind of overlapping ideas and I um the Oregon Health Authority was interested in in getting um that equity and and resilience on the on the table as well as um director baitman Senator there we go Senator Deo yeah thanks uh chair um you know I really appreciated the presentation early on um that Colin did on the EPA uh climate reduction Grant and I wonder if it would be useful for us to consider a sort of standing agenda item on uh Grant proposals and maybe even more to the point news about Grant receipts you know that the grants come through um just to kind of keep the commission a breast of what we're asking for and what we're getting um uh you know I just think that that would be a kind of useful thing not anything you can plan for exactly um the way that you can a topic uh but um having that as a standing agenda item a potential agenda item I think could be useful I think so too that sounds a idea director baitman um thank you chair I'm still trying to gather my ideas around this but um you know we we've mentioned throughout the meeting earlier the concepts of resilience and equity and adaptation and I'm wondering if um as we kick off some of our guest presentations and discussions throughout the rest of the year if we might do some context setting and talk a little bit more about some of the landscape or systems wide approaches that we we need to be considering as a state I think um dror Bell put it really well when she was talking about housing and she was talking about the cost burden of Transportation where you put your houses compared to where you put your jobs compared to where you put your schools um how you group things and whether you even have to get in a car in order to get all of these things accomplished is going to be huge and that's systemwide and that's where your multipliers and your amplifiers come from right I was looking back at your um figure seven I've lost it now and in your prep materials about the types of um scenarios that really get your emissions driven down and at the top of the list is you know higher Urban residential density and reduced residential floor area this is how you design your communities and where",

        "text": " that's been voted on uh we don't have anything to bring forward you know so we were just working on generating our studies getting our ducks in a row so we we had um all the necessary uh supporting documentation to uh make a ugb expansion proposal so um we did work with the county as uh we've indicated you know as part of our pack they were on that uh advisory um so there's been conversations with staff but in terms of coming to the Planning Commission it was a matter of you know completing that proposal completing all the study we're getting everything nailed down so we could demonstrate that we have done that work and that it does comply with all the applicable rules and regulations and we've been um in regular contact with the district commissioner commissioner Willie at the county level for a number of years and finance director Reed and I gave a presentation to the Board of Commissioners in early 2022 on our progress so I apologize if we haven't made it to this body yet but but right now we're the applicant so we'd be just like any other land use applicant coming forward you know I do want to add that uh this actually is something that has been proposed in the uh uh in the planning work program and for the record I just want to highlight that we did have a um a work session back in June of 2023 with the Planning Commission highlighting uh this and the tiger ggp yes I remember that um the reason I'm I'm pausing over this a little bit more because I just I guess I want to impress on my Commissioners but I feel like you all are asking a lot of questions and and understanding the significance of this I've been on the Planning Commission this is my seventh year and this matter is by far the most significant that's come before us when we've done worked on code revisions um you know code can be put in place and then it can be revised again at some point and um so they're not they don't have this sense of permanence and then when we do sometimes we do plan amendments and those are permanent but they affect much smaller areas a few Acres at most as I recall so now we're doing we're looking at something that is a big change and it's um it's uh the use of farmland and that you know that's not going to go back that's once change that it's it's done so I just feel like um this is something really significant for Washington County and it and it deserves our careful attention so I do appreciate the three of you coming tonight and talking to this about to us giving us all this information I guess I have one more question which is um the blue areas seem large you know the the they're around 600 acres I believe and the employment is shy of 200 how did you come I know you've done the studies but can you talk a little bit more about how you came to that sizing of the areas Bill do you mind taking that question I don't mind at all um so um for the for the state rules that we have to follow um we updated our economic opportunities analysis which is uh basically goal nine economic development in our comprehensive plan and required by the um your city with its own ugb and in doing that back in 2021 getting a little bit of the weed City Council made it clear with a resolution actually that they recognized that because of all the residential development that had been um you can kind of see on the map right below the word West Union Road on the east side and next to the 77.3 Acres that are golden there's a new residential develop newer in there Sunset Ridge that's just under 400 housing units that are fully built and then the Bryn Hill development north of town and the area that looks vacant on this map just north of North Avenue that's about half built out now and that's around 500 residential units and city council recognize that um the city in five years was going to have the worst ex-urban bedroom community imbalance tax base of any City in the in Washington County and one of the worst in the Portland metro region and so by resolution it directed um effort on ugb expansion to explicitly balance the tax base so that the city had resources to provide basic Services we don't have a Parks and Rec Department um we have to rely on grants or have in the past tend to rely on grants for certain things like Street improvements and sidewalks certain Street improvements certain sidewalk improvements in addition to our own ability to pay for things and Council made it Council directed that future future residential need was obvious and we would need to plan for that by the rules but we needed to rebalance the tax base and an ability to provide services and do things on our own like development services like commissioner Kaiser mentioned a little while ago that's one of the services that um we'll be looking to scale up on our own but we have to do that with so we found our eoa found that to have a higher quality of life in the city and balance services and work-live balance and walkable services and employment among other things um that was the amount of employment land and opportunity to grow the economy that's what you see in the in the hypothetical blue areas in this map here so that that was really kind of the okay thank you for that answer it's very helpful um commissioner Frye um I just had one uh one question really um and it's kind of been involved to share Lockwood's comments um the slides are really helpful the conversation is really helpful um but I was wondering if we could have easy access to some of what I'm sure is public information on what's been done on the process so far so we can review some of the additional studies and documentation to make a really informed decision here I'll kind of share that answer maybe with Todd but we we are bringing the full record forward you know so everything that we've generated uh around this proposal we'll be moving forward through the county um it's it's quite a bit of information um but you may focus more on the studies and and maybe some of the testimony than some of the other aspects but uh that we'll all be coming forward and I'll let Todd kind of share with you maybe how that will be presented to to you um so it will be part of the record that goes to the state the county just to clarify the county is doing a separate ordinance that is that the county will be making its decision based on a lot of the findings um in the housing needs analysis and the opportunities analysis but the county will be doing its own findings also um so I I just um but in terms of uh information on the process that North Plains has gone through I would probably uh direct you best to the North Plains website I know the economic opportunities analysis and um uh housing needs analysis are are posted there from what I recall and I believe there's meeting minutes from uh from the stakeholder advisory committee that was involved in the ugb expansion for the last couple years um yeah and we can um as part of our uh reports we can provide links to those documents um I've got them here and they're they're quite lengthy documents um but they will be part of part of what the what the criteria are um considering the um the ugb expansion um the adequacy of the analyzes that the city did and whether um what they're proposing kind of matches with what those analyzes are and those those are the basis for their proposals so I think um at the least we would provide links to them so that planning Commissioners can can read those and see what the what the city did in preparation for um proposing their expansion that'll be great to have those um easily accessible so I'm sure there there's a lot of information there thank commissioner will uh thanks chair Lockwood I have um another statement I actually look at this is not very aggressive at all uh knowing that uh the 140 Acres that I reference in Woodburn when it was annexed I remember there was something like a five-year land Supply so I this if they think that this is going to get developed out over 20 years they'll probably have a plan back on the table in in 10 years to to um expand the ugb further so I'm actually a little bit less concerned about that but what I what I'm I'm sort of the opposite I'm curious if you could anecdotally maybe briefly explain like uh I know a lot about the the 20-year land Supply rule but it's always just sort of a vague thing like did the city of of North Plains try to get the ball rolling earlier before you kind of felt under the gun and and and not get Traction in what happened historically that that or that you finally got going now or or are you actually on a good pace and just development just happened here at the tail end so quick that it looks like you're running out of land I can I can take that actually so um the history of North Plains is really kind of told in terms of um before voter approved annexations were ended by the legislature and after um North Plains for a very long time was a 1100 1200 1300 population city and that was largely because um in the state of Oregon prior to 2016 2014 or 2016. I need to clarify that um cities uh in order for annexation to be to occur into a city voters actually in the city of North Plains and some other cities voters had to approve it and for years and years way back when um voters would deny annexation of anything really just because of sensibility back then um when the legislature ended voter approved annexations because it was holding up housing Supply mostly Development Orlando was already in the urban growth boundary for a number of um suddenly was able to annex by legislative decision by city council only and so that began a building boom in the city of North Plains one thing to keep in mind is it's not obvious in this map right here but if we were to roll back to the map that shows the urban reserves and Rural reserves and undesignated lands one thing that we um one thing that that that we like to press upon people about why North Plains is has been growing and why it we ex we have to plan for it to grow moving forward is that North Plains right now is a shorter commute a a shorter in time commute to Intel Ronler Acres than South Hillsborough is people who",

        "text": " star single family new homes uh prog program requirements and those are substantial you might check that out online uh manufactured homes also gets a $2500 bump available for certified eligible energy star manufactured homes uh lots of program requirements around that and then multifam there's a $500 uh incentive is available for home certified eligible Energy Star multif Family new construction or f f mfnc program requirements with a larger tax credit of $2,500 available when prevailing wage requirements are in place and then also the Zur or zero energy ready home receives a $55,000 if it's sold after January 1st 2024 it's probably going to be happening now um these are all brought about by the inflation reduction Act of 2022 amended by the re Revenue code under 45l you'll see that used here on the slides so that's a Revenue code and they're to provide eligible contractors with a tax credit for eligible new or substantially reconstructed homes that meet each of these qualifications the energy star the Zer so some pretty substantial tax credits that are available there any of you that are working with Builders or are a builder um good to pay attention to those and and and uh understand them so you can add them on so I'm going to jump over to the next slide these are some Odo or Oregon Department of energy incentives that we have available as well um Oregon solar and storage rebate program funds solar and storage with paired storage systems for low or moderate income home homeowners and organizations that serve them um H the note of the lwi income or moderate income um you'll see more and more uh investment in these areas to help uh folks that are underserved struggling um to get into uh buildings that uh are are less expensive to uh operate um so we're we're trying to support that uh direction also we've got the energy efficient Wildfire rebuilding incentive um back then uh when we had the wildfires in 2020 there was substantial damage um there it funds $3,000 to rebuild a home that was affected by the fire uh up to code and then 5,000 for above code there's also more for low income in manufactured homes and multif family units um we also have the heat pump incentive program uh Senate Bill 1536 directed Odo to develop a $10 million heat pump deployment program so some money going out there for heat pumps and also to create a $50 million Grant rebate program for the installation of heat pumps by landlords trying to get after that tenant market and then also a fund uh $2 million uh grant for a commun community cooling center program for extreme heat events um but I want to back back up and talk just briefly about the state of Oregon's uh storage and solar and storage rebate program for homeowners that's up to 60% of the net cost or $5,000 Which is less for solar and storage a applied to your building so some pretty good incentives there as well to think about as you move along and try to build buildings that really sense any questions about that information let's see Kevin you asked for the 2024 orc do you have a commercial incentive program in mind not from Odo at this point in time I think Scott me touch on that with Energy Trust incentives so I think that's where we're going next hold on just a second Advance the slides yeah introduce you to Scott Leonard from the Energy Trust of Oregon take it away Scott thanks Roger hi everyone I'm Scott Leonard I'm the program manager at Energy Trust of Oregon I oversee the EPS new construction program that's our residential new construction program um I think just to address the question there um there are incentives for Builders building uh to Commercial Code or commercial new construction um that's not what I'm talking about today um but if there's a specific question about how those work um I'd be happy to answer those just send me a message here in in teams or um I can give you my email um so Energy Trust is independent nonprofit U we serve investor own utilities uh that's PGE Pacific Corp Northwest Natural Gas Cascade Natural Gas and a Vista and so we have incentives and support for developers Builders subcontractors excuse me uh working uh in those territories I'm going to talk a little bit about our 2025 program um and so the way that we set up our programs is it's uh we set our Baseline on the code so the 2023 orgon residential specialty code that went into effect um so we have a bit of a delay and the reason for that is uh the Builder will pull a per and we want to make sure that all of the previous codes permits are built before we implement the the new program um so starting January 2025 the new baseline or the 2023 code would be in effect once we have that Baseline we set our incentive options or Pathways or tiers whatever you want to call those um those are in development right now um we'll probably have those done in the next two months and start sharing those out typically we start by sharing those out with the verifiers verifiers are those uh Consultants inspectors uh working with Builders uh to verify that the projects meet Energy Trust specifications and requirements um so as soon as those are available we'll we'll put those out um a recommendation just because of the way the code has changed and the way that um we address Ducks inside um we're seeing that a Ducks inside strategy being um the thing that Builders need to start considering uh in order to qualify uh so looking at bringing your ducks and your hbac within the conditioned space um or deeply buried in the Attic uh those are kind of the requirements in code and so reach out to Energy Trust if you're a builder uh talk about how you can qualify for those incentives and uh never too early to start thinking about the next program 2025 is right around the corner so um uh reach out to Energy Trust or reach out to a verifier to start figuring out how uh it's going to look 2025 next slide Roger the way that we set up our incentives is it's a performance-based incentive so uh once we have our Baseline which is the 2023 code we'll use some energy modeling software that's either ecotope or REM rate um and we calculate what the percentage above code is and based on that we produce an incentive and we're also uh calculating savings which are reported to the utilities which the home is being built built in so there's a sliding scale or performance-based incentive uh based on how well you do or how much above code um the home is in addition to those base incentives or EPS incentives we have some other um call these kind of more prescriptive or kind of a set incentive um that go for doing other things like solar ready uh that's getting your home ready for a solar system so not a solar system installed but it's ready to accept one same thing with electric vehicle ready SAR and storage ready building the home to be Net Zero so the home over the course of the year uh produces as much energy as it uses and then some other um really helpful incentives are um these two around affordable rural or tribal I hope that's self-explanatory but it's meant to help offset the cost or um additional cost that might be um in those projects and the last one I'd say is probably the most important incentive that we have which is early design assistance which is getting a meeting a charet a design meeting with all of the contractors stakeholders involved um as early as possible um so you can set up a plan a strategy uh to know what you want to do to reach the code reach uh Energy Trust incentives reach the reach code uh reach any other certification that's out there and early design assistance meeting helps um really get those goals uh in Place uh and the incentive is meant to help offset the cost of that meeting and coming soon we don't have this yet but it is on the way is a solar Plus Storage installed so those systems actually installed in the home now it's very exciting we did some tests on some homes um and it proved to be positive so we're going to try and get some incentives out there for those builders that are interested in doing that that's all I have any questions for thanks Roger absolutely Scott hey we got a couple of questions here one from John kosaki uh has Odo shared if when the Oregon rental homes heat pump program will be refunded yeah those are uh in the works right now so soon to um post information and also what is the proposed efficiency requirements for dual fuel systems maybe that's a mark question um if the commenter could I guess clarify is are you looking for what it would be in res in the actual residential code organ residential code for people selecting say to do a dual fuel system for their additional measures or are we talking about a minimum in in code or I guess guess a little more clarity on the question I guess if wouldn't be more happy to help on that a minimum in code is my question so minimum encode the the bare minimum en code will be set by uh Federal standard so it would be the efficiency for the furnace in a dual fuel system would still be an 80% furnace and then the heat pump itself I think it's what H I'm trying to remember the HS SPF 2 now U but I think it's something like 8.2 um but whatever is in the federal um standards for all manufacturers so the minimum code will be set by federal regulations and wouldn't differ from the minimum whether whether we're strictly a furnace with an air conditioner or a air conditioner and or a heat pump and a furnace those minimums would never change so okay and then how how about the the to meet the reach code if you're wanting to use that as one of your measures would it be uh what you earlier so you could probably still do dual fuel you would just pick one of two um one of the paths so you're either doing a high efficiency um furnace or a high efficiency heat pump I would assume it would probably be um if doing a combo you you would sort of pick one path or the other meeting one of the minimums we haven't set up anything in any of the Oregon codes for um credit to go dual fuel so to say have a lower minimum furnace efficiency if you're going dual fuel um we don't have anything in there currently would just either pick on the heat pump path or the furnace efficiency path currently but",

        "text": " an overview of City Limits and our growth area Sherwood west of course to the west of City Limits again about 1300 Acres um inside to the South is our Brookman Edition you see the annexations that are starting to come in here with the Brookman Edition mainly we're seeing residential in this area which is what the concept Plan called for as we move closer to Highway 99 we get into more commercial mixed use a little bit higher density housing as well um so we expect the the Brookman Edition to start filling out this way and this way and for Sherwood West once it's brought into the ugb to start around the high school as one key uh development node area and then have that move South um and then we have our tonen employment area to the east side of City Limits along 12ton Sherwood road you can see the annexations that have been happening here recently as well a lot of uh really exciting growth um and new development in this area as well in our Industries um this is uh a map that Sherwood staff put together recently just really kind of looking at the the full picture of recent Westside Urban growth boundary expansions and how Sherwood West fits into their on a map but also in terms of land uses as well so uh just really interesting what's what's happening a lot of planning going on um in this Roy Rogers 175th Corridor that's the outline here in blue and um just moving north to south South Cooper Mountain uh brought into the urban growth boundary in 2018 River Terrace 2.0 was 2023 the most recent ugb expansion King City of course was in 2018 as well and now we have the Sherwood West expansion here in yellow so it's a lot of growth along this along this Corridor um through really even just in this small area for different cities looking at uh ugb expansions and growth and get into it in just a little bit about uh land uses then of course even further north of this we have the witch hazel Village South as well which came in in 2018 so between all of uh these planning areas since 2018 there's been over 10,000 housing units planned within those uh ugb expansion areas and that gets us to the the Sherwood West concept plan and again to the west of Sherwood City Limits I'll just give a brief overview of it and then we're actually going to go back into the uh public Outreach that we did and some of the some of the details of the land uses for resident unemployment U but again starting here in the north along Roy Rogers Road this is in purple we have about a 250 acre employment Zone uh we're targeting this for what we're call it mixed employment um we really hope and think that we can attract our Target Industries here in advanced manufacturing there is an opportunity to create about a 95 Acre Site along this corner of Roy Rogers and SCH Sherwood it would require land assembly but there's relatively few property owners in here and relatively large lot so optimistic about the opportunities for economic development and employment land uses here we have two Community Parks you can see here in in the darker green um chicken creek which runs through the Sherwood West planning area is really really the key uh Geographic um you know I don't know divider of the area if you will but also hopefully a place where people come together and connect uh we do have a Regional Trail that's planned on the south side and um it'll run straight into this area right here to the east is the Talton River National Wildlife Refuge so if we go back to this to this one here really interesting what's happening you can see the Wildlife Refuge here um and you know frankly Urban land uses planned around that and I think it's just as as time goes on I think it's this uh protect of the National Wildlife Refuge is going to I think be more and more uh more and more important and just serve more and more of a uh value to the community as as we continue to grow in this area um and so we do have a strong Vision to connect chicken creek uh straight into the twon river National Wildlife Refuge and have these neighborhoods to the North and South be able to access uh that that Refuge the Sherwood High School is here in uh White it's already in the urban growth boundary and in city limits we have mixed um mixed land uses proposed around here mainly higher density mixed use shown in red um apartments or multif family shown in purple um housing kind of mixed in uh throughout is the yellow color and then as you get to the South here we have what we're calling the hospitality District or the Gateway District really taking advantage of Sherwood's location as the gateway to Wine Country and these you know these Hills the chaha mountains um up here lots of Vineyards here and so Wine Country really starts you know to the to the west of Sherwood West and even to the north a little bit um but the heart of wine country Newberg Dundee that area most drivers coming along Highway 99 and so we have vision for this area to take advantage of that uh economy just a little bit different view three-dimensional view um of the planet area shw or Highway 99 is this dotted line here it comes in to Kings TW and then King City this is Roy twon Sherwood road which turns into Roy Rogers Road our mixed employment Zone here in the north um the king city concept plan uh this is the Wildlife Refuge here their concept plan starts about right here and heads to the north uh this area here is a town center um proposal from King City so a little bit higher density a commercial node right in here and so you know the way we're looking at this and and fitting our proposal within existing and and plan development of course we have our own Town Center here at the historic Six Corners that includes Old Town Sherwood U but King City um as they continue to grow out will also be creating a new town center here so our mixed employment Zone really uh I don't know nicely located between the Future King City town center and our own Town Center if we're thinking about you know these employees um a maybe coming to work from the those higher density areas to this employment District um but also you know potentially going back out for lunch or you know lunch shopping whatever it might be uh pretty nicely located between between the two of them uh chicken creek comes in of course you can see chicken creek runs through and connects to the to twon River National Wildlife Refuge again higher densities and mixed juice around the high school more residential and then the employment or I'm sorry the hospitality District along Highway 99 as you make your way Newberg and that's a high level overview I'm going to turn it over to Joy Chang our senior planner talk about the background work and engagement um and then we'll get into some more details thank you Eric uh so this slide reflects the planning and engagement process timeline so sherard dest concept plan was developed between spring of 2021 and spring of 2023 through a collaborative planning process that engaged a multitude of Sherwood residents businesses and Property Owners local organizational uh organizations technical advisors uh City staff and Consultants next slide please so the city convened two stakeholder groups to help guide the project the community advisory committee CAC and the technical advisory committee Tac uh which represented a broad range of interests together these committees represented um interest and expertise that helped shape the direction and results of this process uh Washington County Lut and various AB budding cities were active members of the TAC in addition to the CAC and the TAC meetings the city provided a wide range of Engagement opportunities including Community open houses online surveys targeted Outreach to high school students meeting with neighborhood associations uh stakeholders interviews and uh we created a project web page and periodic emails to interested parties um as reflected on the slide with every step of the way Sherwood Community members provided meaningful guidance and feedback and this guidance has uh been essential to Sherwood W's planning process and the design of the concept plan reflects this work next please part of Sherwood's vision is that Sherwood West is a walkable Community with a balance of mix employment residential commercial and green space land uses um it is a place where families can safely live work shop and play uh so from this Vision comes six Key Community goals uh the area is designed as a natural extension of Sherwood and is in integrated into the existing pattern of growth in order to preserve the community's Heritage and small town feel um another vision is uh the area attracts a variety of businesses and employment opportunities which helps satisfy the city's need for expanded tax base um another vision is transportation facility served to connect rather than neighborhoods uh fourthly residents have access to a variety of parks and natural areas anchored by of course the chcken Creek Greenway uh the area served by a robust network of active Transportation options that are integrated into Sherwood's existing Network and finally um community's goal is to the growth and development are well planned and implemented of the areas or implementation of the area is pragmatic next slide please so um as you can tell uh these are the residential land uses proposed in uh Sherwood West we have multif family Cottage clusters middle housing uh typical neighborhood um zoning uh these residential land use in sh West is planned for a variety of houses options that will meet the needs of a wide range of Sherwood West residents um was a key objective of the concept planning process providing housing opportunities for firsttime home buyers seniors who may prefer to age in place or downsize their housing and moderate income household will require a wider range of housing types than has typically been provided in Sherwood um example of housing types that have designated places in Sherwood West include single family detach homes on smaller Lots Cottage clusters Town Homes duplexes triplexes fourplexes Garden Apartments and midrise apartments uh these types will be in addition to the standard single uh family detach housing that has characterize Sherwood's development so far next slide please in 2019 hille 2001 legislation stated that the area zoned for residential use uh that allow for for development of detached single family must also allow for all housing types so the total estimated amount of future housing insur would could range roughly 3,17 up to uh 5,582 units depending",

        "text": " the 1980s the comprehensive framework plan for the urban area called the cfp and the rural natural resource plan contain policies policy 10 um is is for the urban area and it is uh includes um the policy to protect and and enhance significant natural habitat and then there's some strategies included within that policy the community plans contain the maps and the design elements identifying and describing the community's um out outcomes for the sites with significant natural areas when um excuse me significant natural resources when development occurs and then finally we have the Community Development code um mainly section 422 which is our significant natural resource chapter and those are the development review standards um for the sites that have map significant natural resources so each of the 11 Community plans contain a significant natural resources inventory maps for the urban area this is an example of an original uh Community significant natural resource map showing those resources for the Bethany area with the blue identifying the water related resources and the green areas are um what's called the wildlife habitat areas these Maps were created without um computer GIS capabilities and they've remained relatively unchanged since the 19 uh since the 1980s the community plans also contain Design Elements some very specific that call out local community natural resources and the desired protection measures when development occurs and so you will see changes to the design elements through the ordinance process well so turning to the standards in the um Community Development code section 422 we have um significant natural resources terms to describe the categories that were mapped in the County's original process water areas and wetlands water areas and wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat so those areas that might be near the water areas and wildlife habitat kind of a general category of sensitive habitats usually forested areas that are nearby water areas and wetlands but a little further away so here are the categories that we have um listed in um section 422 for the significant natural resources the water areas in Wetlands um are what we call kind of strictly limited there's um uh no alteration to the riparian corridor um or within the water area in we but there are certain allowances um including an enhancement of a degraded riparian Corridor and then there's uh requirements that you have to describe how you're enhancing the uh requirements and so you can see there's a lot of subjectivity in those uh requirements that we need to address the other category wildlife habitat um and water areas in wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat include another Cate uh include another standard where you have to make a finding the finding that the proposed use in a significant natural resource area will not seriously interfere with the preservation of the natural resource or how the inter interference can be mitigated so there's a couple of terms in there that don't really um give us a good guidance or not very clear and objective of what is serious what is seriously interfere mean and then how can um the de the developer mitigate for any of those impacts that are um seriously interfering with the habitat so one big change to the Oregon administrative rules division 23 was that it set up a rule to allow Metro to develop minimum requirements for regional resources versus having local jurisdictions comply separately with Goal five to comply U metro map the natural resources at a regional level which I'll speak to on the next slide and they using that in ventory as the basis for compliance um by providing a set of options for local jurisdiction it's called Ti title 13 nature in the neighborhood and the port Portland Regional jurisdictions May comply with these standards rather than comply with the standards found in uh division 23 oars um included in title 13 are policies for local jurisdictions to Pro protect water quality and repairing habitat and to encourage habitat friendly development practices to comply the uh the county developed the twon Basin specific program and applying Metro's inventory for riparian habitat and amended our comprehensive plan to implement that program in 202 20 20 2006 excuse me including uh which included some uh uh CDC changes it basically relies on clean water services to review the water related resources and encourage habitat friendly development uh practices for fish and wildlife habitat so here's the uh example of the that same Bethany area on the uh earlier slide with the Metro regionally significant inventory map overlay this ma mapping was completed in the early 2000s and it included categories of riparian habitat those blue areas um show and areas that might be adjacent to the um to the creek beds and the Upland habitat areas which are mapped in the green and showing those areas a little bit further away from the streams another important distinction from the County's Maps is that these areas were mapped using GIS mapping and had classifications of the quality of the habitat and for the purposes of the regulations under title 13 the county is required to protect those riparian habitat areas shown here in blue so here's a a graphic depiction of the different habitat types and habitat is generally the place where a plant or animal species naturally lives and grows providing for food shelter and reproductive needs the riparian habitat down in the center there are the rivers streams the wetlands maybe some undeveloped flood Plaines includes a limited Forest canopy of those adjacent areas or on on the creek beds and they provide important habitat for fish and wildlife as well as other water quality the Upland habitat is like what the name says it's Upland from the riparian habitat and that it's the vegetated areas Beyond um that habitat including larger forested patches that provide habitat for wildlife I touched on this at the beginning of the presentation the state law changed in 2017 through Senate Bill 1051 it required that all housing is needed housing so you must only apply clear and objective standards to residential development and it applies to all land not uh not just buildable land further changes in 2023 um clarified that the clearing objective requirement applied only within the urban growth boundry until a later date when it will um be expanded um and appli to some more uh areas of lands examples of uh clear and objective standards could include things like a numerical standard non-discretionary requirements where you can say yes or no or the the reviewer could could agree with or say that the applicant has met the standard or performance standards that describe an desired outcome so the Crestline subdivision in 208 uh 2018 and 2019 2019 was an early test case for the clearing objective requirement and their effect on significant natural resource regulations EIC County it was a proposed subdivision on a site with county map significant natural resources in the meter area the applicant preserved the Wetland and riparian areas as required by Clean Water Services requirements and County regulations and proposed a preservation of a portion of the wildlife habitat area that was mapped on the site the county hearing officer determined that certain um standards that we talked about earlier in section 422 were unenforcable because they they weren't clear an objective and the land you uh and and uh were those uh were later appealed to um Luba and Luba and the court of appeals agreed with our hearings officer that our standards were unenforcable because they were not clear objective so during during this time as well um the there were some in the community they that have felt that the county didn't go far enough to protect natural resources and that the significant natural resource standards may be inconsistently applied to address this the board authorized a significant natural resource assessment and Report which provides a much lengthier history um than what I talked about tonight and some recommendations and alternatives for moving forward to get clear and standards and uh there are some um board adopted um uh recommendations included in that and the board directed work on an ordinance um to make our standards an objective and so um I just brought this down here you can see it's a pretty thick book it has a lot of information that you might be able to um reference as you're looking through your ordinance and you can see if have questions about how we got here um outlined up until 20120 that's available online as well um in the spring of 2020 while we're work on completing the significant natural resource assessment report the land conservation and development commission found the county out of compliance with Goal five because of those three um subjective standards um that were unenforceable so they said we didn't have a goal five program in place um because we didn't have rules in place to follow to protect our natural resources they issued an enforcement order directing um us to amend our regulations to be clear and objective and gave a deadline um of October of that same year um they also put in place a stay on development that might um impact a county mapped wildlife habitat and it was in place until we made those changes to our community development code so uh we quickly did that in 2020 um we adopted um ordinance uh 869 and some habitat assessment guidelines to to address the enforcement order the objective of the ordinance was to address the standards that were not clear and OB Ive and make some minor changes that would Aid in the development review process for water related resources it meant retaining the same limitations on what was allowed in these areas while making the standards clearent objective um and they also needs to be compliant with title 13 for the wildlife habitat areas it meant retaining a certain portion of the wildlife habitat areas to be preserved as the mitigation amount and allowed the remainder of the site to be developed habit assessment guidelines were adopted later through uh rno process that um detailed uh gave us details and guidance on the process and requirements for sites with wildlife habitat so when the ordinance was adopted uh the enforcement order was lifted and um but the 869 was appealed to Luba 2021 so Luba issued their decision in the fall of 2021 and remanded the ordinance back to the county uh the habitat assessment guidelines were also remanded by a separate lubba order that followed the main takeaway in that decision was that the county needed to follow the most current state Oregon administrative rules under division 23 when making any changes to our natural resource regulations so that means that rules and standards that are referenced um also must be clear and objective and uh we uh the Luba also found that the county needs to make findings based on the record that the Statewide planning goals are being balanced um with uh the natural resources Pooler especially um goal 10 housing balance housing with um protecting natural resources and um",

        "text": "you're on good evening everybody and thank you for joining us for the public informational meeting for the nolan hills wind energy facility tonight we're going to be providing some information about the proposed and also about the energy facility citing council review process and we will provide an opportunity at the end for public questions and so please hold your questions and comments to the end you can raise your hand i'll talk a little bit more later about how to raise your hand and make a question or a comment at the end of the but first i wanted to do introductions my name is kathleen sloan i'm a sighting analyst with the oregon department of energy sighting division i am the lead analyst on the oto review of the nolan hills wind energy facility application for a sighting certificate as a signing analyst i will process and review the application and provide recommendations to the energy facility siting council the energy facility siting council has the jurisdiction over the proposed and they are ultimately the ones that make the decision on to whether or not to approve or deny the application for a site certificate next slide so joining me here tonight are a couple of my colleagues i have todd cornette and sarah esterson and they will be here to assist with the q a portion nancy hatch is hosting the meeting and we're getting some technical support by walter adams we're all with the signing division of odo um i do not see that we have any members of our citing council so okay we do have uh council member cindy condon is now on the list so she's joined so thank you okay so we do have a member of our council uh council member cindy condon is is listening in and participating as a interested member of the council the developer is nolan hills wind llc they are owned by capital power and here tonight to present for the capital power team is matt martin and matt martin will introduce himself now and the members of his team that he will be leading their presentation so matt you want to say hi thanks thanks kate uh i'm matt martin i'm the director of business development for capital we have a few members of the team here jay shukin and jennifer schroeder from capital power as well as linnea fossum from tetra tech so we'll be available to answer any questions i'll go through the presentation in a few minutes but welcome any questions as we go along thanks kate okay great thank you so we have a few logistics to cover before i get into the details of the presentations um just for starters this meeting is being recorded and it will be posted to the project website along with the copy of the presentation that is already available on the website i will show you the link to the project page in a subsequent slide later in this after i provide the overview of our process our energy facility sighting council process then the nolan hills team will describe and present on their proposed facility and we will open up the meaning for questions and comments at the end and please hold your questions and comments until we get to the q a part of the agenda which will follow the presentation by capital power so i am going to get into asset review process next slide so i'm going to give you a brief of our process and where we are in our process for this facility so just really quickly um department of energy sighting division has one primary objective and that's to follow its mandate was established in and its mandate is to review large-scale energy projects for compliance with applicable standards and rules for reference citing refers to the technical permitting review of a proposed energy against a number of predetermined standards and i will talk more about this later based on the site-specific locational issues that may be affected by any particular facility please note that land acquisitions land leases and easements are outside the fsec review process in addition to reviewing projects seeking a permit known as a site we have a compliance program that oversees compliance with each site certificate including the during the pre-construction construction operations and decommissioning phases we conduct sites visits at least annually and more frequently when a facility is under construction the oregon department of energy citing serve as staff to the energy facility siting council and we call it fsec for which i also say as amsa the council consists of up to seven members who serve in a volunteer capacity council members are appointed by the and are approved by the oregon senate and represent a diverse array of professional backgrounds from across the state while odo citing staff make recommendations to the council the council itself is the final decision-making authority for energy facilities under its jurisdiction including the proposed nolan hills wind energy facility next slide so i'm going to briefly go over the seven major steps in our citing process and let you know where we're at in this process and give you a sense of what to so our process starts with the note of notice of intent the notice of intent is the applications in the applicant's intent to submit an application for a site certificate and it includes general information from the project and this functionally is the conceptual plan from the applicant the information in the notice of intent allows the reviewing agencies local governments and the public to identify applicable requirements and special issues of concern that the applicant needs to address in the application so this is the the pre-application phase the next step is the project order and the project order is issued by the and it defines the analysis area for various types of impacts and identifies the applicable statutes rules and ordinances that the applicant must in the application and this establishes the applicable requirements for the application at the application step the applicant describes the facility it's anticipated impact and provides information to prove that they meet the and as you can see in our flow chart the red arrow the third step is is where we are at so the application has been and it is going out for agency review and we will be moving into the draft proposed order phase next i'll get into a little more detail about the draft proposed order step in the subsequent slide but in general terms the draft proposed order is the oregon department of energy's initial findings of fact conclusions of law and recommendations to counsel on whether or not the facility would comply with all applicable requirements the next phase in the process is the proposed order an important part that i want to mention in the draft proposed order process is that once the draft proposed order is issued it is open for public comment and we'll talk more about that later once that period has closed a proposed order is following the public hearing where fsec reviews the draft proposed order during a council meeting and based on the direction from fsec odo issues the proposed order and a notice of contested case the proposed order is staff's revised based upon the comments received just a note about the contested case it's important to note that only persons who raise a relevant issue in person at a public hearing or in writing by comment deadline on the draft proposed order may participate in the contested the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer the last step in the process is the final order and the issuance of the site certificate fsec reviews the hearing officer's recommended contested case order and issues a final order approving or denying the application for site the final order's findings of facts and conclusions of law are based on the proposed order and the outcome of the contested case if the council approves the application fsec also issues a site certificate next slide so this slide is showing you a little bit of a timeline on where we're at in the process so the applicant for nolan hills wind submitted their notice of intent for this facility this proposed facility on september 11 in 2017. odo issued the project order on january 2018 based upon review of that notice of the preliminary application for site certificate was submitted by the on february 27 a review of that preliminary application resulted in an amended project order issued by odo in august of 2021 the complete application for site search certificate was filed by the applicant january 31st of this year 2022 we are now in the draft proposed order drafting phase where we are reviewing the project we anticipate that we will issue a draft proposed in april and that is a tentative issue at stake at which time public comment would be open for the record next slide so what is a complete application an application is complete when the applicant has submitted information adequate for council to make the findings or impose conditions on all applicable council standards and the application is used to draft the findings and recommendations for fsec review in the draft proposed order it's important to know that a complete application is not the same as approval a complete application basically is the trigger for the review process to begin for the dpo and part of that process we notice reviewing agencies we give them an opportunity to comment on that compliance with agency regulations um we also let them comment on proposed or recommended site certificate conditions for respective uh areas of authority and we hold a public information meeting um which is what we're doing this evening this is not a this is a public informational meeting and the purpose of the public informational meeting is to get the word out to the public about this project and to give them an opportunity to participate in the process and also for the applicant to explain their project to the public next slide so this slide is taken it's a screen grab of a document that is available on website our our project and our sighting facilities website and it's basically a one-page document that helps explain the relationship between what the application is required to contain which is the division 21 and how it relates to the council standards and rule as you will see in this example that there are several of these exhibits that cross over multiple standards and rules for example the one at the top is materials analysis it links to the general standards of review but it also is tied to the soil protection standard and so for each of application requirements these exhibits are intended and required to demonstrate how the project and how the applicant will meet the requirements of the standard or the rule so the magnitude of what an applicant actually has to provide um to document that they have met the burden of proof for each of these standards varies based upon the type of energy facility and the location of the project next slide so the draft proposed order the draft proposed order is where odo makes findings of fact conclusions of and",

        "text": " in-depth analysis of available Storage Solutions on the market and identified the Pure Storage array as the best value for Marion County the new array is easy to operate in the manufacturer's support plan includes proactive monitoring replacement of hardware parts when needed and ongoing software maintenance the new array will have enough capacity to meet our projected storage needs for the next five years and the cost of this array plus three years of service is 839 thousand dollars and will be purchased through a so that was a nice easy approach for us we didn't have to go out to RFP because these storage arrays and many other are already available in these Cooperative and that's what we have for you today do you have any questions any questions um yeah Mr chair if I mean Gary it does say that there is a 36 month uh yeah so part of this storage degree comes with a very good subscription service for support okay so on a regular basis every three years or every 36 months the vendor actually provides newer Hardware to us as part of the agreement and that 36 months also includes all software firmware security type patching and then we have the capability after 36 months to go year to year to extend for as long as we want thank you because you're saying the life of the hardware is five years but the subscriptions for free yeah thank you let me show you questions and I will take a motion yeah Mr chair I'll move that we approve a purchase order with uh CDW government LLC in the amount of 839 576.50 pennies for the purchase of capacity optimized primary storage array and a three-year extended service I'll second the motion the motion a second is running for the discussion see none of those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye thank you okay Ryan oh Brian's not here we're going to consider approval of an order revising the bylaws and the handbook for the Marion County Solid Waste Management advisory Council good so I'm going to fill in for this format side of things here seeking adoption of changes to the solid waste management advisory Council by walls and handbook just a little background Marion County Board of Commissioners formed the solid waste management advisory Council or swamak on February 1 1989. the swamac is a public body that was formed by the Board of Commissioners to make recommendations on matters related to waste reduction recycling composting and disposal of waste Marion County policy requires that the Board of Commissioners approve any changes to the bylaws and handbook of the council the current proposed edits to the bylaws and handbook would change who can be acquainted to the chair or vice chair position the member review process meeting location specifics and updating electronic meeting procedures at a regularly scheduled swamac meeting the council approved the proposed changes to the bylaws and handbook and made a motion to send them to the board for review and approval this is brought to a management update recently and some of the changes that were discussed there have been incorporated as well any questions I yeah can you tell me what what the reason for who can be appointed to the chair and vice chair position is um so typically in this Council we've we've struggled to maintain a chair and vice chair it's a it's a pretty big um so making this change would open that up to people who maybe hadn't had the opportunity to participate in the past what is what is the change exactly though I I it you know what's it we didn't talk about this we talked about some other details in the in our uh I don't know whatever it was management updated work session you came to us and I don't I understood I understand that there's a challenge with filling it but I don't know why it was restricted before let me in the red one two member commissioner Tom I might be able to help you out here I believe and I'm I'm not really clear but I believe there was a couple of the members that are industry members that were limited to become chair or vice chair correct because they were in and I believe that was the change was to and those people obviously have you know they're they're paid yeah they're paid to be there and not by us but they have full-time jobs that are involved and I believe that was the change was to allow them to become chair they're still voting members or maybe some of them were non-voting members if I remember right uh yes I believe they can all they can all vote now okay yeah I'll support this but I just want to say on the record that industry members are very valuable to our process but they're also very biased to the process because it's very self-serving to them to engage and I don't mean that disrespectfully but I I um look to to Brian and yourself to make sure that the committee's voice of representation from the community is the priority over the industry in the event that an industry person becomes chair Vice chair and it's not over controlled by them yeah so this this says it it comes to us and then we to decide whether or not they actually become the chair correct all this all this says is that they can recommend somebody approved to be chair and vice chair and then we get to decide whether or not yeah and I don't have an issue with that if we were to appoint them I'm just stating that in my experience the chair Vice chair in an advisory type committees typically are the ones that work with staff more directly more purposefully and therefore things can be you know controlled in a manner that there's less focal input from the citizens and I don't want to see that yeah it's under um I believe this is where the change was it's not redlined I don't have the red line copy but um number 10 appointment of Officer swampek shall nominate and recommended Commissioners members at Large and or members that represent business or a community Organization for the position of chairperson or vice chair the council shall appoint the chairperson vice chairperson who sir Shall Serve at the pleasure of the Commissioners yeah I would also just add I've I've been attending this one that means last year and um I feel like it's very balanced actually right now that that industry Representatives do not dominate swalmac it's actually primarily dominated by citizens who have a policy interest in this area yeah if I were to articulate it not having the numbers in front of me my my feeling at these meetings is about two-thirds independent citizens with policy interests and one-third industry representatives and my experience is that there's actually a pretty healthy dialogue that the industry representatives are often asked difficult questions by the citizens at large and there's a really good uh exchange of ideas and education process that occurs because often the industry folks are explaining to all of us myself included how they do their work so it's the outcome you want is more recycling or or people to to consume less waste or put less waste into the system these are the levers that industry has to effectuate that and um and I would say my experience that there's a really healthy conversation where a lot of the citizens say well we'll have you thought about this I know this is how you do it but what if we did this instead or if we did that instead and so at least right now my experience is that it's actually a really healthy dialogue and and there's a bit of tension right where the citizens would like a little bit more maybe an industry is dealing with the constraints that they have and trying to bring the community together to to get to a common goal right which is waste reduction in our community but that's definitely something that we as you've mentioned need to safeguard to ensure that it continues to be a healthy space with that healthy tension and isn't dominated by by one group or the other yeah good thank you I'm glad that it exists that way I just I know that when people sometimes get into positions of power in my own experience not here but that things can be taken advantage of and I don't want that to happen so thank you thank you okay and Mr chair I just we did I remember one of the discussions at the work session was about the business and industry member one of those three could be a citizen at large so you have eight citizens at large potentially nine citizens at large if one of those members was so you've got a majority or a potential of the 16 members being citizens at large so it's heavily yeah heavy opportunity for our citizens to participate in this besides the the industry there's four industry members that are represented in the in the waste in great I will take a motion okay I'll move to approve an order revising the bylaws and the handbook for the Marion County Solid Waste advisory Council I'll second the motion do a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye aye motion passes Tom it looks like you're still up yep and I'm actually going to have Matt join me as well to talk a little bit about the uh welcome to that work under this contract I wasn't going to bring it up hey come um he's wearing a sweater that's pretty good right now I wish everybody before the meeting so again for the record Tom Kissinger Parks program supervisor um here seeking approval of contract with Ash Creek Forest Management LLC for noxious weed mitigation and native plant restoration in the amount of 790 thousand dollars uh Marion County Public Works manages 250.69 Acres of

        "text": " just gonna kind of uh lick these split here however we can totally stop and go back at any point in time if council has any other questions or wants to go back waste minimization it's pretty simple before you go on to waste minimization this is handling um so i see that the applicant does not intend to join the rural fire district we do have structures i'm not as worried about the panels as i am about the operation and maintenance buildings and so i'm kind of surprised that there's no willingness on the part of the applicant to annex into the rural fire district i realize that there's taxes associated with that but it does seem that it's uh important that there be some kind of fire protection associated with those is there some other provision for fire protection for the maintenance buildings i would have to and i don't know if sarah has it open or can pop it open but if we went into this the attachment u3 which is the fire protection and emergency response plan um i believe that there are measures that uh the applicant represents of how of what equipment they would have on site during construction and operation i don't off the top of my head the details of the offer like the equipment that would be at the o m buildings during operation to address buyers joining and working with the rfpa is that they they basically participate as a member have and share fire protection equipment on site and i believe that we have details or examples of what some of that might be i don't know sarah do you have that in front of you or does it have that level of detail so so i believe that over in the fire protection plan that there are measures of fire control equipment that they would have on site and then participation and membership in the rfpa means that they work in conjunction with the rfpa to make sure that there is fire protection equipment on site or that could be shared with other members that are in the area yeah i remember reading something about the fire district would have access to that equipment but i guess my concern is that there's no obligation on the part of the to provide structural fire protection which they're responsible for um unless the project is within annexed within their boundary and so you know they may or may not respond and they're not obligated to now one of the this is dara one of the requirements in the draft fire protection and emergency response plan is that they would the applicant would be obligated to provide evidence of its participation in the high desert rfpa or um and include a copy of the agreement okay so this may not be accurate then in the dpo or in the following presentation okay and you have it right there is this something that we can con this is marcy is this something that we can uh maybe later if i'm needed trying to see just one minute here let me look at my slide and maybe it's just how i represented it in my health words this is kent and picking up on uh what um councilor jenkins is talking about there i seem to recall that even though they may not it may not be plausible or feasible to annex into the fire district they could still contract for services and so maybe that could be a solution to provide the fire protection needed i think we're all on the same page i think we see that there's potential for liability and risk and i don't know that it feels like we're satisfied with the answer thus far this is sydney and i i'm just on page 170 of attachment three i might be reading this wrong um but to me that read that the department includes in the plan that the applica applicant either submits an application for annexation to the christmas valley rural fire protection district or becomes a lifetime member of the rangeland fire protection association to provide fire protection and response so i guess i i thought that was covered so are you reading from public service condition number four i am reading from page 170 which is sorry of just um it's the paragraph right before public services condition 4. the the just in the discussion so the last couple sentences includes in the plan submit an application for annexation or become so that's all you can do is you can you can ask to be included you can't force them you can't force the district to accept so that's that's that's adequate cooperation with the local rural fire protection and emergency services so yeah i'm just concerned that the doesn't at least make them ask so i guess that would that would be something that i would raise yeah oh to me it's they are going to participate in the and then may annex into the fire you know again all they can do is ask to be included in the rural fire district or as kent says contract you can't i don't think you can require them to be a member of the rural fire district because that's up to the rural fire district to make that decision and what right now what the condition says is in cooperation with the local fire protection and emergency services you know that's i don't think that's you know requiring them to ask but i think that requirement is in the plan that the condition is referring to okay okay i don't have that open so that's what is on in in front of the screen here this is the attachment u3 that the department compiled based on the representations and the only reason i'm bringing this up is because i don't believe the other agencies are responsible for structural fire they're responsible for wildland fire and so it's the real fire district that's responsible for the structural i think that's why it's important that they have play a role here so if that last sentence what was on just on the screen were included in that can if you go up a couple pages there the last sentence the last sentence of a previous paragraph um was saying that they must provide evidence just back up a little bit well i guess i in the proposed order or in the attachment knowing what you were just showing on your screen the the plan yeah i don't have the plan open uh and i don't either that's why well prior to construction yeah that sentence if that were well but the so the condition routes you you know the condition says do the plan and so and then the plan it's it has so it's one of those situations where could put it in the condition but it becomes a redundant requirement i know i don't i don't think it has to be in the condition but i am concerned that this says that it that it is a particip you know it is participating participating in the royal fire district and again i think it's they can only ask they've asked to participate and then and here it's i don't know i don't you know the desert roll fire protection area or annex into the christmas valley rule for fire protection area i think the idea is that right now it reads more like this is marcy that it's an absolute that this can happen versus it's not guaranteed and how do we capture that well i think uh it's you put the word request participation evidence of requesting participation in the high desert rural fire protection area and that makes sense to me of its i don't i think i'm accurate here i might ask the other planners in the room kent and uh um and todd my experience is you can't you can't force them to be in the royal fire just because it's not their decision it's the real fire district's decision yeah and that's my experience as well business can't and but i also had the experience that if requested for annexation into the district but were unable to get that they could still contract for services from that district and i think that might be something that we want to add in here they request to annex into the rfpd or contract for services or particip request to participate in the rfpa um yes sorry i'm like so we have a letter from fire protection or from sarah this is this is from the fire district correct but we don't have a comment letter from the rfpa right right the fire district basically says yeah you can annex um but the applicant isn't necessarily representing that they will do that they're representing that they will i think maybe what is missing here is just the it is not it is likely that um coordination or like membership in the will happen but it's not a guarantee and it's kind of framed as a guarantee here but in a way it isn't uh councillor jenkins uh question about structural protection and the high desert rfpa is going to be more for wildfire and less for structural protection whereas the rfpd would be the provider of services for structural yeah i don't have the boundary maps but i assume the structure structures are in the rural fire protection district and i guess on long after is we probably need to go beyond um coordination with local rural fire protection that's here's the keys to the truck you want to drive it go ahead well i think we need more than that helen do you think maybe we could table this and go back and evaluate the relevant information on the record and make sure council has everything they need to propose a potential change yeah yeah i think so yeah it'd be a good idea if council is comfortable with that i appreciate that this is marcy and i just want to say i think these are the type of things that councils should do is have this kind of conversation but i definitely think it would be great to allow you time to go back and assess or whatever and then come back with us okay we will do that all right thank you one one other thing this is ken it might be that some of the response from what do i want to say here the the the applicant i guess will do maybe not wanting to annex to the district is because we're talking what 4 000 some acres but and that would that could be a big price tag to annex uh to the fire district possibly i don't whereas the structural fire protection would be just a portion a small portion of that area a contract for services with that fire district might be a lot or something that they could uh as opposed to annexing the entire boundary of the yeah so what you're recommending is um that that would be an ore or or a contract for structural protection yeah i i think that's i think that gets at you know what my concern was is structural protection going to rely on sarah to help me with these notes to address what i think um i think we want to be able to move forward and i think that maybe we'll con this and council will proceed maybe through",

        "text": "defense okay okay terrific that's what we'll do then so at this juncture we'll pick up with solid waste and recycling annual rate review findings and with Mira samantel and Thomas Eggleston to the Conservancy good afternoon chair Harrington border County Commissioners and we are pleased to be here before you today we have two agenda items that are back to back but they are separate so we'll just remain at the table after this the second one and the first one is that you're mentioned is a solid waste of recycling annual rate review findings and recommendation and I will turn it over to Tom Eggleston good afternoon Joe Harrington Board of Commissioners as mayor mentioned we do have two back-to-back land items that are in very linked together um so the second one should be fairly go ahead get started on talking about the rate review for this year so a quick overview of our rate review presentation we're going to have an overview of the purpose and desired outcome the policy questions before your board today the rate review process the findings from this year's right review talk about a proposal for urban unincorporated residential Foods waste collection program so stakeholder engagement and staff recommendation first uh to frame the conversation the purpose is to provide your board with an of the annual garbage and recycling rate review analysis and for findings regarding service in unincorporated Washington County that our desired outcome is for your board to provide direction to staff to regarding the proposed collection rate adjustments and authorized staff to return with an action item on the 27th of June the policy questions before you board are two-fold first is should the garbage and recycling collection rates be adjusted to maintain a 10 return revenue for certificated haulers who are our and second should the garbage in our second collection rates be further adjusted for urban unincorporated residential customers to include food waste in the yard debris collection come back to those at the end so a quick overview of our rate review process we do have a annual rate review process here in Washington County it starts on March 15th of each year when our detailed cost reports are due from each of our franchised Solid Waste those reports are reviewed and for accuracy and consistency by staff and our CPA for Marina and Company we do have a enhanced review or a site visit for the top look at my notes real quick top certificate holders by Revenue totally no less than 75 of system Revenue so that we can do a double check to make sure that the supporting documentation agrees with the recorded documentation and we also have the ability to pull in extra certificate holders if we see anomalies in their dcrs as well which is the detailed cost report acronym uh the fourth step is we take we make adjustments Based on data inconsistencies for example if we know disposal should be at 135 dollars a ton and we see some coming in at 300 autonomy would honestly that might be a data entry error we'll check with franchisee make sure they agree with those adjustments and we'd make those adjustments and that's yours we then consolidate the reports all together to have one composite so we start with nine or eight reports now that we have eight franchisees and we can create one master document that's a composite for those then we look at the system return on Revenue based on the composite and we make or propose adjustments necessary to return that to the Target RoR of 10. we then go to the garbage and recycling advisory committee we did that on May 18th and received a recommendation for your board to consider in your decision making as well and now we're here today for Board review and board action um this month and then we would move to notifying customers uh depending the decision and then rates would be adjusted by for customers at the end and this is all for unincorporated Washington County and that includes everything outside of the Cities including the rural areas or all lines of service commercial Dropbox and taking a look at the findings from this year's rate review total revenue collected by the system was a little over 41 million dollars this year the income collected or earned by the system was about 2.6 million dollars and that turned out to be a 6.35 return on return revenue is the calculation we use which is essentially uh Revenue minus our expenses which is our income or profit and then our profit divided by our revenue and that gives us that when we break down by line of service thank you can you define profit for me profit is revenue minus expenses well actually obvious but what's what's an so costs of drivers cost of trucks cost of ownership owner salaries uh yes salaries are part of that we have a related party scale that so if the owner is the also the manager or the president then we have a related party um scaling page you can pay yourself a salary yep and you can recover depreciation on what basis depreciation thanks for asking yeah yeah seven year depreciation schedule on assets so garbage trucks and facilities and things like that pretty much tax basis okay anything else weird in there if we don't know not that I'm aware of there might be some details in there that we could follow up on the site if you have more questions okay um so with breaking down return on Revenue by line of service we see that residential um operated at a six point seven six percent return commercial 7.13 Dropbox um went down to 3.11 and then combining those together an average of that brings us to our 6.35 looking a little bit about what contributed to this change last year we actually did some rate decreases because we came in above at around 13 percent um we did see that the overall system increased um Revenue by 4.7 so that's growth and customer base return of some commercial sector activity um things like that we also saw that direct costs of operations outpaced that and came in with a 12.3 percent increase and that was related to fuel costs which increased by 58 year over year um Solid Waste Disposal costs went up by 11 percent recycling processing costs went up by 56 and that's just a volatile recycling markets took a big dip at the end of last year and that really hurt the system by the tune of almost a million dollars driver wages went up 7.7 percent vehicle repairs were up 27 but related to that we saw depreciation decreased by um 20 and that's because they're having trouble buying new equipment because of the supply chain issues so there's more costs maintaining older trucks as they're waiting for new trucks to come we also saw a 7.2 increase in direct indirect costs and that administrative salaries corporate overhead training expenses those kinds of things so looking at rate adjustments to get us back to this 10 return residential sector would need to collect an additional one million dollars and that would be a 3.6 increase in rates and for the average customer that excuse me I'm using a 32 gallon garbage can which about 70 percent of our customer base uses that size can that's at 96 cents per month increase um commercial a little over 250 000 in Revenue needed to bring back to that Target that's a three point one nine percent about eight dollars and 41 cents for a four yard container picked up once a week and then Dropbox compactor needs to earn a little bit over 400 000 um and that's a seven point six six percent increase a little bit bigger and that is about 12.82 cents per Haul on a 10 yard box quick question yeah I didn't quite catch sent a view use of a 32 gallon close to 70 percent of our customers are in a 32 gallon can I did hear it write it down right thank you interesting factoid thanks for sharing it moving on we also have an opportunity this year um to help meet some of our goals some of our sustainability goals and our waste diversion goals um to add food waste collection to our system we are one of the last jurisdictions in the region and we've been constrained by several factors and I'll go over those that are have opened up for us here um facility capacity at the Recology North Plains facility you might recall last year they completed a update and added about 28 000 tons of capacity to that facility a new modern Mass bed composting system with in-bed aeration it's pretty awesome if you ever wanted to take a tour um we can arrange that and same technology that they were previously using or the same an expansion or same methodology so they're still called aeration posts are positive aeration I'm not sure if I get the technical terms correct still the same concept but they've created a with a mass bed that can create one big pile that has aeration in the ground underneath and so they can kind of fill the voids yeah and compost more material on the same footprint and control it better with um computers can tell exactly how hot it is in the middle of the pile it's pretty thank you pretty amazing okay an investment page yes um so that opened up some capacity for type 3 feedstock which is yard debris with food waste has to have a special permit from DQ opened up a little bit of capacity there in our um in our neck of the woods and then we had the Japanese beetle quarantine effort that was playing out in the cedar mill or still is in the cedar mill neighborhood the department of AG has is not enforcing their quarantine this because of budget constraints and they are winning the battle over the Japanese beetle so they're down to about 2 000 they trapped I think last year um they did offer on a side note if your board is interested maybe later this fall when things are more openings on your agenda they can come give us an update on that project but this allowed us to they're not deep burying the yard debris collected curbside at the Hillsboro landfill anymore and so that allows us to shift this over to a composting process because the Hillsborough Landfill couldn't have taken if it had food in it so kind of removed that constraint I have a would you like me to wait till the end if it's about this please it's about this um I I live in the city of Portland and so I do use this food waste collection process and what's interesting to me is that it's reduced by garbage by a lot so is there as you look at the collection",

been described as a little old lady with a computer so i guess you know that kind of certainly is bad um and anyway when i looked up what the leading department of energy's role is with um why they're here uh basically what the what i came up with is that their job is to incentivize and support uh the development of renewable energy and that they collect data and keep information regarding uh renewable you know that that kind of goes along with the idea that the photo staff for instance are paid by the developers and you know all of their actions are are billed to the developers and and pay for for all the work that they do when i looked up the energy facilities citing council and what do they do what is their role uh what i got from that your role is to approve or deny um energy developments and that you're to balance the and the resources that are impact and impacted in the public impact so so you are not focused so much on you know building everything as you are on looking at the balance between the different things that are impacting personally i became involved in energy facilities diving in about 2010 when um actually hanley was working in union county on having a uh anal bridge wind farm developed so verizon wayne was the one who was composing that and so of course there was a lot of back and forth for years on following that i have been involved with the energy facility and citing council now for what like 13 years it's kind of a long time but um during that time i've come up with some observations that i'd like to share with you folks and one is that the fsat staff are involved with these developers for months and sometimes years and that's prior to any public participation so they developed something of a relationship with these and by the time the public is brought into the process the developer and oregon department of energy have become something of a team in the development of the proposed order that is not i think that complicates the oregon department of energy's role as staff to the council because of this history that they have so there's a tendency for the oregon department of energy staff i believe and these are my personal perceptions to focus on the approval of developments as opposed to presenting balance balance presentation about the pros and cons and you know they're not focused really so much on on the impacts of it to people and to resources and an additional change that has occurred i think recently is has been traditionally the oregon supreme court has has relied on august hour i'm not sure how you pronounce it a er rule that said that they would give deference to agencies in the interpretation of their own rules and so because of that there were preventive court decisions pretty much 100 percent were going in support of whatever logo had recommended in the council by the tree um now the courts have kind of changed that um that you can't and so the last two cases that went before the oregon supreme court regarding uh council decisions and and you folks are the ones whose name is on when things go to the oregon supreme court uh did not rule fully in favor of the decision of the council um they found some of the issues in favor of the petitioners that kind of brings me back to your role in and um because you're the respondent in these short decisions and fsat may be making the recommendations but those recommendations are all based upon their goal and their focus as far as what they are charged with doing as an and so when they make recommendations to council they're going to be consistent with those goals your decisions as council members have really long lasting impact on and sometimes devastating impacts on resources in the state and on people in the state and so you know there's seven people who are deciding things that are going to be important to not only the citizens of oregon but oftentimes citizens of the whole country and i guess that brings me to my ask here i've been i've had somebody say tell them what your ass is you know tell people whether you're sending a comment or what is it you're asking them to do my ass is that as council members that you not just accept heartburn recommendations that come from the oregon department of energy i mean that's the only other easy way out and they always have a basis for supporting their recommendations that's their job what i'd ask you to do is really refer back to what what does the statute say what is the literal language of the statutes that you're supposed to be deciding on what's the literal language of the rules that you're supposed to be deciding on you make the decision about whether or not the interpretations that are being either coming to you in bold recommendation whether or not those really do comply with the rules and the and um i'm pretty confident and you probably are also that the decisions that you make are increasingly going to be challenged in court there are uh for one thing a lot of environmental groups who at least when i started here were human percent supportive of whatever decisions came out of out of the council are now ending up not necessarily agreeing with everything that the council is coming up with and so what's more important is the fact that you're going to be judged by future generations about what you have done to protect the environment and the people and not just building things for the sake of building things um in terms of energy development what i wanted to say today thank you for your time did they have any questions thank you thank you happy new year your mind yes i i heard some mumbling in the go ahead with your yeah um i'm i'm the one who gave you the extra time for reviewing the comments on the uh uh hb 2021 but i would like to suggest that since you're getting a new rules coordinator to make his i think it would say him make his job uh do not schedule public hearings and deadlines for comments the day before you're expected to accept the rules that's it i'm not gonna even though you didn't listen i'm not gonna make comments on the uh the one you're just about to well thank you for your comment taking the time to speak with us nancy is there anyone else do not see the other dancer so we've just asked if anyone would like to make a public comment please please be ready so we can call on you please there is no one else in the room wishing to make any comments last call for public comments all the time is now 10 to 29 and we're going to my watch we are going to close the public comments section at this time um next we have a short break schedule so we will take a 15-minute break um and just for the ease of math we will come back at 10 45. thank you oh there you go all right i'm actually happy with this system so the time is down 10 47 and we are going to get started with our next agenda item which is the party generating station proposed order on request for amendment 3 of the science certificate this is an action item we have kate sloan we could say kate today because we're you know we can do that senior exciting catalyst so okay the floor is yours thank you thank you chair grail and good morning council um as chair ground noted for the record my name is kathleen sloane or kate sloan um i'm a senior sighting analyst with the oregon department of energy and i am going to do agenda item e on the card generating order on the request for amendment three of the site certificate so just a real quick overview of the presentation today i'm going to go briefly over the facility the site certificate history the procedural history for the reflex for amendment 3 the proposed changes and requests for amendment 3 and then the proposed order itself i'll go through a standard review of the proposed order which is the action item before council so just for starters um the certificate holder is the portland general electric company otherwise known as pde the carter carty generation station is consists of two primary components one is operational 450 megawatt combined natural gas electric generated power plants with accompanying related and supported facilities on the slide those are the components in black the components in red are the 50 ml megawatt solar pv uh cardi solar farm and it's related and supporting facilities which are the elemental collection systems within the site boundary for our so rfa3 is specifically focused on the components in red the cardi solar farm so just as uh to orient you on the landscape uh the carne generating station is a nearly 5 000 acre site it surrounds the um party reservoir which is in the center and the upper right hand image is the actual footprint surrounded in orange that is the area for rfa-3 that is the footprint of the proposed and approved kerdi solar fire and it's approximately 315 acres so that is the encompassed within requests for amendment 3. so the requested modifications from the certificate holder is to extend the deadlines for both beginning and completing construction of the kardi solar farm component by three years existing site certificate had the construction to begin on or before february 4th and the rfa was filed february 3rd they're asking to extend it another three years out to 2025 as a result moved the completion deadline out an additional three years as well to 2028 there were no physical alterations being proposed in this rfa to the approved facility cardi solar farm was approved in rfa-1 and they requested and the department evaluated and approved a type b amendment review which basically means while there is public comment there was no opportunity for contesting case so just specifically for the science certificate the proposed changes fall under the general administrative conditions in the site certificate 4.1 and 4.2 supports two in both and this is the strikethrough in the site certificate language of what what it is they're proposing to change also if not someone has any questions one way to interrupt me so very briefly just",

        "text": " the state of Oregon that we can use in a limited way and for one purpose and Eh so I wouldn't expect the city to project that we are going to obtain 10 million dollars each year and because we never know what the legislature is going to be and then sometimes we apply for subsidies those subsidies are five figures or several thousand and sometimes we get them and sometimes we don't And there are really two questions how we project the subsidies knowing that we do not know what we are going to do if we are going to obtain them or not how do we project funds that are going to come in and how can they make that prediction based on the legislation Thank you for the question Regarding the subsidy question history of receiving a subsidy each year would be included in the prediction forecast or in the budget if it is a subsidy for which we are requesting it cannot be in the budget until we receive it there is always the possibility of adding it to the budget as we receive this amount of money we would like money we would like to spend it it would be the process regarding legislative dollars I can tell you that we have an agreement formed that we signed that we cannot count on those dollars Ok one additional question we are having a hard time can you turn up the microphone volume Ok I'm going to move closer to the microphone whatever works some another question from the members acknowledges the member Moca vice president thank you Regarding the question and the follow-up to the question member nord about the subsidies if the subsidies come in a way and can be added to the budget many times also the subsidies have to have equal funds eh I don't know, sometimes it's just the subsidy, managed? Let's see if it's a FA subsidy, you have to have equitable funds, if it's a transportation project and money from the Federal Reserve, you have to have the funds for projects for Lo Same for construction projects it can be the same it's a little different the process you have to do a little bit predicting Yes in terms of the grants awarded that can offset Op costs sometimes the grants are for a specific service that you are interested in to the state like providing services to the homeless Or maybe for a specific project and generally not related to our general fund budget Thanks any other Thanks let's talk about the transportation services fund that maintains the roads of the city's transportation services that provide the budget for the Citizen Council's objectives to have a safe environment economic development this forecast is found on page 23 of the predictions on this slide the blue bars represent income and the gray They are expenses, income and expenses, so we are going to talk about the total total expenses and the expectation of savings of all the funds varies by the fund but you will see the net total. The green line eh represents the balance of the fund or the balance of the fund is like in your savings account all the assets that are liquid the transportation services fund has stabilized since the impact of the covid pandemic if you remember a couple of years ago we saw a decline in it is spending less Right now we are recovering Well, we have already recovered and we have also been able to have a favorable balance, now the gas tax also includes other other items, income is the main source of income and this has an impact on the income of these funds, let's say that if the income grows or they increase, are we going to be able to sustain services? There is a need to correct the decline in the balance. A recommendation of happened. Well, based on what happened 2018, maintenance must also be increased for other projects. I think we have a question from member ston. Thank you, President. I ask. If during the process we are going to get a report on road conditions or street maintenance in the city do you know if we are going to have it certainly it is something we could provide we do not have it ready tonight thank you another question cen member Thank you Josh the gas tax o the gas tax is the only solution that will balance it o it has to be approved first by the state Before the city can take action there are possibilities some cities are implementing a fee on transportation services We are also exploring options on what would happen after the gas tax OR in addition to this as a non- generation fee for high efficiency vehicles are avenues that we are exploring but it also has to go hand in hand with what the state does a gas tax is one of the local is one of the options that we have questions from members This is the potential variability I show you the three funds that we present what we believe is the probable result that will be in the forecast document and is included in this the blue bar metallic is highlighted in green we increase the result by 1% of industrial income and expense savings of 1% Then it is a 2% red the inverse 2% less income and expenses this shows a small change in that a small change in income and expenses can have a favorable result in the in the balance in the balance of the funds or in the balance of the funds and can the debt can be decreasing quickly uh the member Alan asks yes quick question on page 4 the transportation services fund the of is in black but on page 35 only the + 1% is black we would not expect the balance to be the probable expectation the difference between the two is of the balance of the funds is the beginning and the end of of the balance is a continue next we have the service fund with the continuous operation of the drinking water service for the city and also includes avoiding runoff and avoiding environmental risks and also helps pay the bonds to make improvements to the infrastructure and also uh the capital projects in the most detail can be found on 31 uh the services are financially stable but we need a lot of capital investment here it shows us a consistency in the maintenance and operations and the prediction for the services is that If a capital investment continues at 7.3 million during the forecast period and the investment has to be made at a sustainable rate with rehabilitation expansion resilience and modernization of the system also every very high rates of urban costs have to be avoided. The fact that the cost increases is also due to the inflation of the supply chain when the service funds have 55.8 47.8 million and this equal to the operating expenses is for structures such as services that are so important in this prediction we have the viability of 1% better income savings better results in blue and green it talks about the reserves that cover 120 days of operating costs and in the yellow line it is the policy of the balance of the funds By the way this fund does have a policy that is shown In Yellow, questions are still being Yes, the president calls the member. I have a question about this fund and maybe it can be resolved easily. I know that we already have it. We issued these habitability bonds a couple of years ago, but if not, I mean, this is hypothetical. If we are not going to buy land two new libraries because we can barely fund the current one, we can use those funds for the habitability bonuses to compensate for some things that are happening with the services. I am going with the legal answer, Yes, there is language that allows that it be used instead of the city facilities but complying with political criteria since it was not the intention of the Habitability Bonus and the services as an entity can also be self-sustaining and they should be able to have sufficient funds to increase the infrastructure that answer your question mien Thank you any questions yes member Jo please Thank you you said that from the political point of view What does this mean the feasibility of using or technically could be used these profits from the facilities or funds from the facilities but no they were not in the They will not be available for some projects, it would be something that could be discussed, but with a supervisory committee, if it is something desirable, if you want to use the funds for something else, thank you, I have a in accordance with member J's question. Is there some type of Alliance? or some session that can help reach that decision you can repeat the question When it comes to that particular one said that there is a team that makes the decisions or they work in collaboration with the the city council that committee is advisory any recommendation it makes comes to the council questions from members financial director please continue regarding the general fund the general fund supports the of for example the library the recreational areas includes finances HR eti the support to the different departments for fiscal year 2025 first year of the forecast period for details of this prediction can be found in the predictions document something to highlight this document Sorry I have a question I am looking at the second graph on page 7 the sources of different revenues for the general fund and I noticed that more than half is property tax but there is some There is one that says internal charges how much of those internal charges come from the property or income tax none of them come on the Property tax we do not use a process that is the indirect cost allocation plan I could talk about that for a long time basically what we do is that we take the support functions we allocate the funds throughout the city they are funds that are not from the general fund to pay their services, so the distribution of the general fund, there is no charge or no charge for those services, it would be a double budget exercise and I would not recommend it, but all the other funds, those for security and protection services, are allocated thanks to the payment of the funds. continue something that is unique to this document is that we present three scenarios for the general fund let's look at them in more depth the first is the current level of service of the positions adopted by the citizen council after budget that we are going to submit for consideration of the council and three the impact of the proposal that we presented on September 18 we will talk in more detail about these I just wanted to give how to say previously that we are going to talk about three different things in the same background Thank you for the clarification",

        "text": " there was a fitting you know makes people stop shopping for big big purchases so that created budget problems for a lot of communities uh communities that were depend on sales tax gas tax other just general streets of Revenue that shut down under created reduced they still have that due to the city services cities can keep them going Transit people at Transit organizations big big big problem okay look at like Zoo Convention Center so I'm in favor as well I hope we have more conversations and stocks strictly limited too projects or infrastructure we have staffing issues or something we might be able to hold them to be rough for ongoing operations just suggestions I'm all in favor of further one of the reasons I want to segregate because this is very careful investment without saving you away so do you I I have an interaction I know so you can work with Ryan I'm preparing it he had a resolution and is everyone okay with just doing this right after budget season or do we want to get it done soon well I can do the transfer yeah before the fourth deadline yeah um and then after the transfer is done then we can do the other part audit on this fiscal year it would be doing tests on spending the federal dollars and they pretty much said it shows up in the police budget you know police salaries you can see that ratio you can see the 101. I'm sure there's more tests to have to do but it's pretty that meets our obligated requirement and I'm sure we'll burn it down your date no that sounds great and as you mentioned at the beginning for budgeting we'll keep that segregated down yeah yeah during the funding process uh we'll make sure and create that additional fund with the city it'll be a new fund and we'll get money moving over there thank you very much David appreciate it so our next item on the agenda is transient lodging tax and guess who's up again also do this so I'm not going to recuse myself conversations and conflicting all right transient login data tax also known as just basically tonight kind of discuss the the restrictions the the ORS that you puts on these funds potential use of funding one thing we need to be careful of but let's try to stay away from specifics uh just because this fund we didn't allocate any spending on so we'd be discussing a few two years budget and I just don't want to be drawn to potentially violating any budget law but I want to kind of give the figures that were that we're kind of considering here and talking about uh the estimated fund balance at the end of this fiscal year June 30th 2023 is roughly about 350 000 that's and anticipated collections moving forward with uh just with the one hotel we have here in town this also includes dollars for the airbnbs you know folks renting out um spaces their homes you know we anticipate about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars uh yearly um an additional Revenue and I want to kind of discuss some risks now or a statue they've put restrictions on use of these funds and it really depends on when you pass this ordinance I don't know the city was after 2001 so 70 percent of the total net revenue must be used to fund tourism promotion our tourism related facilities Finance or Finance the debt of tourism-related and then 30 percent of the net revenue is unrestricted can you use powerless now possible uses of this Revenue I just want to kind of show counsel during this work session currently what does the city spend that could be considered you know related to tourism well we do support all those special events here in the city of Sherwood Robin Hood Festival music on the greens and I kind of put some dollar figures in there you know how much we spend a year on those um the art center you'll notice a lot of cities here in this and kind of our nearby cities they are actually using using Transit lodging tax revenue to Bill Barn centers uh to fund the art center operations and I just want to give you that's how much prior fiscal year almost 450 000 was spent on our operations also the the public art I know we've talked about that the the the art the beautiful artwork we want to put in the roundabouts you know that is I be considered uh you know could bring in tourists Park maintenance we have beautiful Parks here that brings in and then just some other things uh you know Park amenities Trail projects and then there's that 30 of net revenue that can it could fund general fund operation if you can fund whatever whatever we want here in the city the one risk I just wanted to point out that it was actually in the legal Oregon City's report um 2019 is when if the city decides to pass on this Revenue to say a third um to use the city just has to ensure that that party complies with State stats you um and they spend the money according to what what's online in that section so that that's really the one risk I see and really for that I just want to open up kind of start having some general discussions because you know that time is starting to build the balance so the question about tourism and what constitutes tourism is the purpose to bring tourism to others spending additional money in our town or just publicity like hey sure is awesome right it's the it's literally your interpretation to an extent and if it's because if some communities that have lots of hotels it's not a and they have water in it if they start getting areas that might be gray we're not really proven and supported in other actually get the hoteliers around and say this is the start playing these are already our ideas um at this point we don't have much money that much money can kind of get into some give us some gray areas yeah no I just you know like for instance events or even the uh you know the like the Arts operations funding with the idea that if we are able to draw more people in that are buying tickets or having dinner at you know the restaurants here you know well that's theoretically helping to financially improve whereas you know maybe an art in a roundabout nobody's you know it's it's a quality of life thing but they're not spending money because they're dark you know around about necessary but it doesn't allowed oh no it's an allowed use I'm just saying is yeah I mean like I I love in fact I'd love to add more I would venture to Main people do go to cities to view their public art I mean I know I've gone out I think it's a nice city yeah it's not Forest Grove to look at their murals and I mean I think publics are there yeah so actually that's true so some of it does 100 I think in a roundabout yeah but yeah I'm not gonna try to get a picture next to Art in the Roundup you know other people yeah thoughts on us there's so many of them and even though it's a small amount and it's only so in the Statue 30 is free and clear go to the general fund a lot of people think of that and supporting programs you know potentially young you know it's help pay for what the general fund has been doing already with the community organizations to support Collective City operations yeah so here's my gray area that I was wondering about is can I use if I'm saying sure what's awesome and I'm using that to attract business and to say hey you should locate your headquarters here because it'll go off I'm sure right as that improved use of it because it feels like so so the cities I know that how they use these dollars big waves Coastal um that have a big you know tourism activities that are coastal they will do campaign advertising campaigns yes they will do um sending maps for tourists yeah before smartphones yeah they're doing apps on smartphones for tourists to get around um so they're trying to lure people into their Town um so they'll actually hotels love it if you're doing advertising to draw people to the town they have the hotel for instance could we do that for sure um Pendleton um is one of the sounds they take their hotel motel tax and they do a third of the fixed and the baby public art if you go to Pendleton there's public parking so they don't have a that is their annual stream of Revenue that they use and often leverage to get other dollars so they can do public art because they have no other Revenue you know to really support public murals and statues and all that okay great great um other other communities um yes use money to advertise and support locally to help their Community um succeed do things um to brighten up Chinese their merchant areas or their main streets you know I'll be hard as comparison to redoing downtown something some communities might stream some of it into the mainstream program there's a ton of options potential risk but I want to throw out an option um and uh thinking probably the same idea I think if like I think one of the reasons some of these cities put a lot of money into the rehearse Center because what it does then is they're not funding a person it's five dollars and freeze up those dollars right so if there is you know if we wanted to we put a lot of this toward the Heart what we're not spending on the opposite because we put it there we put it into a Economic Development slash tourist fund is now unrestricted we have you know so if we did give money to a community organization or something like that would be untied ourselves for the levels of environments and stuff like that yeah those staff time and all that um but then like some of the groups come to the CPP you're going to ask for money we get free of the CP if we used the 30 of those of the general fund or yeah to become a sponsor or something of those events I see you know let's let's help the the core maybe potatoes of the organization say okay 30 can go to the general fund to help help Parks police help with Library help with um and and do that and say hey and helps booster the cooperates of the um I like the idea of I'm starting at least I'm only at one hotel about a third to support an art fund any art project has to go through city council through the political Arts board to see if we like it we get another hotel at any point we can revisit the revenue stream but just help get things um with community art since we really haven't done anything um but then you're wrong um then that two-thirds next time suggested to the Art Center in the books create a Community Development Community",

you mean that you would wait for future analysis to be done but rather than delegate approval to the department you retain the authority yes i think that would be at your discretion if you think the issue is such that you want to revisit it and you want to be the the approving body then that would be at your discretion to do that okay thank you for the record this is perry chalk tube i just like to let you know that um how it actually works is um you have an archaeologist do a study and find cultural resources and which are basically non-renewable once they're destroyed they're destroyed they're put on record and they're put on the register on the federal cultural resources will not stop a project um they basically file for a permit through shippo and they figure the the site has been captured towards being recorded so it still can be impacted just with the acquiring a permit thank you chalk two sure how i had a follow-up to counselor condons um we have a precedent where the council taken and instead of delegating responsibility to the department kept that final approval and also thank you to um for the clarification on how cultural resources are council member buyer i can't provide such an example but i would defer to folks who have been who have longer knowledge than i do such as secretary cornette or uh even uh jessie ratcliff who has been uh involved with with this body longer than i have they might have uh examples they can think of but i i do not just curious well and and one thing this is jesse ratcliffe for the record uh one thing i'd like to point out is in this with respect to the bond authority uh the council has retained authority to modify that um as we've discussed so it's slightly different um but you know fundamentally it's it's still the notion that the council is um retaining a final say and just to add i would call that a precedent though you know it's just it's an example there are numerous site certificates that are have a condition that's similar to what you did yesterday where if a developer a certificate holder wants to adjust that bond amount it has to be reviewed and approved by council so you'll that's a pretty consistent one i think that's the closest example i mean we have a couple others where um we would have a condition that says if you run into this circumstance an amendment is going to be required and so that immediately kicks it back to it's not exactly the same but it's like it's kind of a delegation of an uncertainty that immediately would force it through the process historic cultural archaeological resource standard three what's the council's pleasure on dealing the proposed order and the proposed contested case order either individually or separately mr vice chair for the record todd cornett um i do have uh proposed straw poll language would be which would be a combination uh which would include the language uh which uh patrick had read earlier if that's what the council is interested in so i can read that and you can please let me know if you're in agreement so it would be to agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed order pertaining to the historic and cultural resources standard that are not related to the issues in the contested case and in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue hca3 with the following modifications supplement the proposed contested case order to include additional facts from the record those facts relate to ongoing role of the oregon california historic trails association and oregon historic trails advisory council in evaluating oregon trail resources impacts and mitigation i believe that's what the language was with again the correction of including as stated in the department's response i think we got it how's the council are we ready for straw poll okay very chalk tube and buyer cindy condon hanley jenkins yes ken howe yes jordan truett yes thank you council okay now we'll move to the scenic resources standard and protect area standard issues sr 3 7 five and six missed oh counselor condon sorry um chair hound members of the council i apologize um can we go back to um the condition the historical and historic and cultural condition number two and i just had it up here and i i have lost it kellen is there any chance you in the proposed order it's page 506. 506. okay and i um this is cindy conden again in at line 27 and it's in explanation i think but the there is a statement that will was changed to wood to me that changes the meaning um considerably and i'm curious what that change was intended to do because personally i think it should be will or must or shall as opposed to wood so um we generally try to use wood until because it hasn't been approved yet they would once approved they will so it's just a tense trying so as not to be presumptive that it is going to get approved this is cindy again i think to make it clearer if the sentence finished finished with the if so they would do this if sure it would make it clearer even better yet must do it if approved by the council so do we need to take any more formal action on that or that's head nods okay thank you so much tardy weather i guess we're ready to go back to where were we oh yeah this scenic resources for the record calendar weather oregon department of energy by my notes here i have um i am starting with the protected area standard in this as council and other folks familiar with the contested case um understand scenic resources and protected areas issues that were properly raised kind of got bundled um and i think that that worked um through the contested case but as as we've had the conversation with council the lens that council applies through each standard changes just a little bit so we are i'm i'm going to do my portion i'm going to go through protected areas and then but council and i'm but there are these differences so of of what is being asked under each standard and then when we pass it over to jesse there's kind of this bundling of the issue and it has you know it relates to both of those standards so um yeah we'll just we will we will go through it um and and in the proposed as we've talked about in other examples the one off the top of my head is yesterday under threatening endangered part of the findings and recommendations underneath that standard was a condition that we said that was imposed over here under fish and wildlife habitat standard so same thing over here there's there's conditions that are imposed under the scenic resources standard but then maybe under protected areas we point to um as a recommended mitigation or condition approval that helps assist in meeting that standard so that said i know council is familiar with protected areas um because we've been looking at the rulemaking for it as it stands now we're looking at the current protected areas uh standard on the books i don't have it all here councils looked at it kind of after this preamble of protected areas there's a list of the types of protected areas as council can imagine that for a long linear facility with an analysis area of 20 miles there is a lot of protected areas evaluated for this so and i pointed out under the um uh historic cultural archaeological resources council does have a difficult definition for mitigation council does also have a definition for significant and this appears um in almost all of your standards and so i'm just going to read it here pretty quickly sorry crystal and it's having an important consequence either alone or in combination with other factors based on the magnitude and likelihood of the impact of on the affected human population or natural resource or on the importance of the natural resource affected considering the context of the action or impact its intensity and the degree to which possible impacts are caused by the proposed action nothing in this definition is intended to require a statistical analysis of the magnitude or likelihood of a particular impact i know so but we love um we love words and so this is what we do we we go through the rules and then we like apply this and and how does this make sense with the particular question going back to the standard but um counsel we can also come back to this in another standard if we're really asking what a significant adverse impact is second ago my slides are not advancing um the next and i i am going off of a pdf right now so in my powerpoint i kind of had these staggered so you could see them a little bit more and again these are just snippets from tables in your proposed order so because we have a lot of protected areas so these are a list of the protected areas um in the definition of the protected areas i know it's hard to see here um and then it's the type of type of category and then over on the far right column we have the distance from the proposed route or the applicable alternative route and the county that it's in um underneath the protected area is standard i don't know why these aren't advancing annoying okay council evaluates noise traffic water and wastewater disposal and visual um underneath the subprovisions of and i'm going to paraphrase here which is but pretty interesting because we don't we don't see this that often but the council's protected areas uh standard does contemplate and allow crossing protected areas um so protect areas that are listed underneath the standard and one of those provisions is that if functionally the proposed facility is co-located with an existing utility right-of-way such is the case with the proposed route in the area of of lad marsh um that's uh right here in union county not too far away so we have recommended protected areas condition one because lad marsh is a wildlife management area that's managed by odf and w odf and w provided comments and the provisions under this condition protected area condition one um incorporate requests from odf and w and coordinating activities with um odf and and that was for the proposed route um and now and then there's also the morgan lake alternative which um we did have a public comment earlier and i know when i talked about this may help forgive me i forgot who who raised it but we were talking about the proposed route and the mill creek route and then there's the morgan lake alternative so here we are in beautiful legrand union county and so this is",

        "text": " that's not that might just be something to navigate through if you do run into to just second what Hannah said if there are if you really aren't sure who to contact uh let us know and we'll see what we can do um Odo has relationships with just about every Energy company in the state and can probably help make some connections um okay thank you uh Greg go please feel free to unmute and then I'm also recognizing we have eight minutes left and there is a um two questions now um in the chat um great uh so I just I I fully get where this this whole program is coming from and where it's what what the intent is I'm just wondering um you know for for example I'm in Maran County and it we are just getting a Contractor on board from our 2023 uh June 2023 grant funding Point um because it does take that long it took that long for us to go out for to find a contractor to get it all approved to get it through our process to get approval to even apply for that funding um and then to do the work I mean our period of performance is almost two years for that and we just put 880,000 essentially $85,000 towards getting four really small cities eops just updated by a contractor um and that is like the city of Detroit which has 180 residents right I mean it is small you know so thinking about this as a countywide coordinated plan and effort with no subject matter experts in it that are or ganic to the county um and um I I'm just really struggling and I I I get the intent to think about doing a cohort model but even still looking at two counties in the in the wam Valley alone there's a lot a lot of power infrastructure power and energy infrastructure here that we would need to go through and assess and I am just um I'm not really seeing the feasibility in this being a successfully exec Ed program um or just something that we can feasibly do when it comes down to it I again I I understand what where it's coming from I appreciate what you're doing I wish I I truly think it's a great thing to do I just don't honestly know if it's feasible for us to take $50,000 even though it's you know free money it's it's allocated to us um and just make it happen because it it takes so long for us to get a Contractor on board get approval through our government process actually do the planning of a countywide assessment um it's just um you know it's it's just a really complex thing that you're asking us to do when we don't have the understanding or competence to to do it um I oh go ahead Max S I was just gonna say Greg we hear you and it's good feedback you can understand where we're coming from you know we're implementing a program that's been directed to us to implement uh and doing the best we can but believe me we understand $50,000 doesn't go very far especially in you know more populous counties or even more like territorial large counties even if they have fewer people so recognizing the limitations I fully get that we're I can also say that we're making notes for ourselves and uh we'll talk to the people that we talk to about you know limitations in the program and the uh pros and cons of How It's been outlined in statute um yeah and sorry there's just uh two pretty not good questions all questions are good questions but there are two questions and I recognize there's four minutes before uh for the um webinars off so unless there's like a very specific um thought about Gregs I just want to make sure that we're covering everyone before we have to move on I'm sorry Greg yeah no I think I mean the last thing I would just say is that again there's that good faith Clause so if timing is an issue you know you've done your best effort you've gotten the funds and Contracting has taken a long time because it does you know I know there's a trust to believe that we're going to say we're not we're not here to slap anyone on the wrist we want to be a good partner to you we want to help this planning get on the ground and so if you like hey this is what happened we would say please go forth and proceed continue with your planning get the work done so that's the ethos here um the questions in the chat one is from um Shelby it says is there going to be future funding directed to counties that have a resilience plan in place to implement the action identified yeah so Sarah spoke to one opportunity which is our C program um that's certainly you know a very natural linkage to um access funds it's available projects that have a resilience component renewable energy projects that have resilience component um receive elevated priority within that program um I would definitely check out the list of resources and opportunities in that plan development resources document um So within Odo um you know there may be additional opportunities there are some already some additional um and whether or not this program would involve into a specific program I can't say um but I do we are trying to find those connected opportunities for you now I also will just add on to that is that um all of the municipalities that are within your counties um if they are applying for any grant funding for specific grants it's always great great to have some sort of regional plan that they can see identified those plans particularly for federal funding um so that is another like uh benefit I don't think I mean there's not going to be a federal program that's like if you have this plan then you qualify um however uh you know always having that kind of uh coordinated Regional or countywide effort um is is always really helpful in terms of applying for um state or federal grants um and then oh H I would say I agree with you on that since you're taking notes and I know we're talking about limitation of the program but that puts the pressure on the county to be able to manage and take on this money if we have interested cities or special jurisdictions or special interest groups that really want to do this so then it I'm for sharing if since it has to go to the county to pull the plan together it's just putting that resource requirement and that need on the County's labp um and so it puts us in a place of having to navigate that in our respective counties so just trying to share that for awareness um and the difficulty for us at a county level for sure feedback yeah excellent um and then there's one more question um about uh Melinda from Harney county says how would we go about getting the energy map from our utilities I just asked my power supplier about getting the map and I was told they do not give out that map from security reason s yeah so I would say questions like that um Melinda I know we've been in touch over email so I'll just follow up with you and we can try to have a conversation and I can talk to some folks at Odo and think about how we can help facilitate um those conversations potentially talking to our um colleagues at Energy Trust of Oregon so I think that's kind of a one-on-one conversation to figure out what that looks like um but certainly if you run into a barrier like that we want to be a resource and um do the best we can to help navigate those conversations and find avenues for you to get the information that you need um and just in terms of feedback I also do you know if you if your county doesn't end up participating in this program I do have in mind to reach out and get some more feedback um closer to when we're going to report out to the legislature just to make sure I want you to know that we're hearing you and we really care about your Insight and your feedback um so we can you know help move forward on this great work so I guess with that um this is our final page with our contact information for the program you have the website um thank you so much for your time today um really appreciate you being here and sharing uh please follow up with me if you have further questions there's anything I can do for assistance um thanks to Sarah for facilitating Max for presenting and our other Odo staff for being here um yeah thank you so much bye y'all",

        "text": " voted three years ago to end planning for the Salem River Crossing and you face a very similar decision and in making this decision you should give the highest consideration to what our Chief Financial Officer who's sitting over here is telling you in the staff report for agenda item 5B he writes the total impact to the general fund five-year forecast of this action and the continuing general fund subsidy is estimated to be 6.35 million dollars the general fund forecast without commercial air service or continuing current homeless programs anticipates depletion of the fund balance by the end of fiscal year 2026. he writes every additional dollar spent reduces our flexibility for how when and the target for solving the ongoing structural deficit in the general fund what he is saying to put it in plain language for everyone here is that our city is already forecast to be insolvent in three short years and spending 6.35 million to subsidize flights to Las Vegas or who knows where will make the problem much worse you should also consider the promises that you made to voters in the recent Bond measure for the new Fire Station in South Salem two new Branch libraries how are those going to be operated is keeping your promise to come up with funds to operate these new facilities more important than Commercial Air Service I think so is making sure we have the means to continue our assistance to our unsheltered neighbors more important than Commercial Air Service I think so unquestionably so so I ask that when you get to item 5B that you will ask our Chief Financial to elaborate on his statement and that you will have a full discussion of whether subsidizing commercial air service in Salem would be fiscally responsible thank you thank you Mr schepke are there any thank you Bill Carver thank you hi I'm Phil hi mayor new mayor many accountant new council members it's great to see you all thank you for your service I'm Phil Carver I'm co-coordinator of 350 Salem a group dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas the um in my uh 45 years as a professional policy analyst after my PhD at from Johns Hopkins I have never seen anything more cockamamy than the proposal we're talking about we have we have no airport name we have this unnamed Airline has not negotiated with City staff the city staff says it may have four to eight flights a week but it's not confirmed by any Airline this is all hearsay there's no guarantee that they'll stay after two years there's no and and particularly a low-cost new newly established Airline the last airline that was gonna throw by this service went bankrupt during the process of trying to get into Salem so this is this is an amazingly thin proposal and and there's all this statements about I'm a professional Economist how it's going to boost the Salem economy four to eight flights a week to to Las Vegas and some other Southern cities is going to change the economy of Salem that the number of people file a pdx's is incredibly higher than that and so if you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions then you would improve the shuttle service of people driving to the airport that's the way to reduce the car emissions the missions from Airlines are far greater than car emissions more than double and the and Bus and Train emissions are less than half of car emissions and finally the most important consideration is the what economists call opportunity costs what are you spending this when you spend this money what are you not going to be able to spend it on you're subsidizing at four flights a week you're subsidizing each person 68 dollars roughly instead that money could be spent on all the things that people have talked about this is not this is this is a fiscally irresponsible Act this is not being fiscally conservative it's being fiscally wild and crazy to think that this somehow is going to improve Salem's economy to have a few more heads and beds a few more people working at service wages minimum wages I've urge you to vote no thank you thank you Mr Carver any thank you Mark wig good evening I'm Mark wigg I live over on Fairmont Hill and thank you counselor and mayor for your service seriously really thank you this is a huge job and volunteer and I ask that you please do not approve spending millions of dollars on this speculative drive to get commercial air service in Salem the city is being asked to spend millions of general fund dollars to upgrade the airport when we do not have a contract with an airline to provide the service these are general fund dollars that could be spent providing safe place it for unsheltered people to live people are dying on our streets because they are unsheltered and we are proposing to spend millions of dollars so that wealthy people can fly to Salem to taste wine the staff report is filled with optimistic projections of benefits and underestimates of costs a bias that is expected from advocates for example the staff report says the parking lot will not need to be expanded and will have a 70 percent of the occupancy the first year that's 113 spaces in the next paragraph it says we expect to have the number of flights per year increased by 50 percent and after that you'll the next year after that it'll double in the third year without having to increase the size of the parking lot but doubling flights will mean that we need a parking lot of 226 cars that will cost millions of more dollars not in the staff report when the city begins negotiations finally with Airlines to obtain service the airlines are likely to demand additional things such as expanding the terminal so passengers don't need to wait in line in the rain the strategy for Advocates is to get the city hooked on the idea with sunk costs before real negotiations about 30 percent of the people in Salem have never been on a plane and yet we're proposing this please don't approve this thank you Mr wig are there any questions thank you for coming down Lori Doherty push it one more time push the green until the green light come there you go okay um hello Mr Mayor and counselors um good to be back in this room I almost forgot how to get up here again so um my name is Laura Doherty and I live in Ward one and um I'm a co-coordinator of 350 Salem Oregon I'm in full support I think Bill Carver submitted a much longer statement of comments and I am support those as well as comments that you know he made verbally and other people have made I just want to make a few remarks of my own for Salem to subsidize commercial air service at McNairy field is expensive unnecessary and in contradiction to Salem's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions air travel as I said has had the highest emissions per capita of any form of travel for the benefit of a small number of Travelers The Proposal would take millions of dollars from programs that are much more urgent and worthy of City funds City funds by far most air travel from Salem will still happen by a Portland International Airport it would be much better for the city to work on improving shuttle service to to PDX at some point it will be possible to use electric vehicles as shuttles the Salem climate action plan urges large employers to provide incentives for reducing emissions from Transportation employers can use digital meeting technology to remove to reduce the need for travel when business travel is necessary employers can subsidize employees fears fares I'm sorry subsidized fares on a shuttle to PDX as a benefit you know to be a benefit that can provide there are ideas under discussion for commuter rail service and better Intercity bus service in the Willamette the City of Salem needs to get its priorities straight to get serious about lowering emissions from transportation and to get creative about policies and programs that truly serve the needs of our community thank you thank you are there any questions thank you for coming down and Council if you don't object I would like to call forward a person signed up under agenda item eight he's the only person signed up at that time so they don't have to wait until the end of the meeting thank you so I'll call Alex OST be sure and hit that button there with the little speaker on it please thank hello mayor and council members my name is Alex zoust and I am in front of you today because I need help and guidance and I do not know where to turn my wife and I own a J Lawn and Tree Service LLC here in Salem owning my own business was a long time dream of mine a lot of hard-earned hours and money has gone into our business in fact in order to save up enough money I went to work in the oil fields of North Dakota for three years sometimes I would work upwards of 120 hours a week it was super hard and dangerous work dangerous maybe an understatement I actually broke my leg and my ankle nearly losing my leg the work I do today is also very dangerous not just for me but also for others we have all seen the news lately many stories about branches falling killing people damaging property and we all can't forget about what happened during the ice storm me being able to properly do my work is critical and needed so I'm saddened that we are treated as if we are criminal I am here because I am at a point where I do not know what to do not sure what to do I'm frustrated beat down and at the point where I may have to go back into the oil fields what is unique about my line of work is that is I have to work closely with the people of the city I get calls about dangerous trees and have to make decisions on the spot many times I have to contact the city and get permission to move forward which as of lately has not been an easy task without naming names I have had one staff person give me permission to cut down Hazard histories and then another sends me a ticket in the mail this has happened to me more than once and now the fines are in the tens of thousands I would go into more detail but I know my time today is limited my goals are simple I want to have a stable business that provides for my family and have a safer City I charge fair rates my prices are actually lower than most because I want people to be safe while keeping as much money in their pocket as possible I didn't do all this to start a business knowingly to start breaking the rules I want to stay in compliance but it seems like no matter what I do I'm",

Oklahoma, Florida. 32179. I wanna. I don't quite understand what a 7.7.7 is. One regarding animal services center. Rehabilitation or rehabilitation or whatever it is. 777. Did you say 7.7.7? Yeah. Madam chair, that's an agenda item to enter into a contract with an architect to start the design on the animal shelter for the new animal shelter design. Oh, is that what that's for? Yes, sir. Okay. I couldn't quite understand what it was. Thank you, mister Walker. All right. Thank you. You're very welcome. Is there anyone else in the public who would like to come forward with an item on today's agenda? If so, I invite you down. I see a hand raised. Please come forward. And I just need your name and address and the item number that you have a question on. Good morning. My name is Katherine Gandy, and I'd like to. I don't know the number of the item, but it's on the one about the animal shelter. What I'm very concerned with is I. Did I give you my address? If you would please give your address. My name is Kathryn Gandy. 10410 105th Street, Ocala, Florida. In the last three weeks, I've been involved in some of this animal stuff. I had a dog that went missing in our neighborhood, and we went door to door and thank God we found it. Right. But. And we've had a stray cat we've had to take care of, so we own it now because we haven't been able. What I'm saying is we need this shelter as soon as possible. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Yes, we certainly agree with that. Thank you. And the items on this agenda are going to move as fast as possible through the legal process to get that done. Thank you. Thank you. 2025 is a long time away. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Is there anyone else who has not spoken in the audience who has an item that you would like to have pulled, come forward, discuss this item? I missed one. Yes, ma'am. 742 Pioneer ranch. I'll allow it. Go ahead. Okay. Karen Arman. 22 34 Northeast 6th place, Ocala, Florida. And I'm just curious about the Pioneer ranch, which used to be JB ranch, and the unethical, my thoughts and opinion of allowing building to be there after what happened to the people at JB ranch, isn't that going to be the same scent, the same area? I don't understand your comments. Where you sell. Where people can't open their windows or sit outside for the stench of the sewage plant, but the old one. I know. I'm gonna take your comments, and I'm not going to respond because I don't have. I don't. You don't have it in front of you? Well, I have it in front of me, but I don't understand exactly what your comments are. This is for a final plat to be approved. So that is the topic that we are dealing with today. Okay, thank you. If there's anyone else in the public, come forward. Dale Kratzer. 259. Mary Noaksley in Ocala. Which item, Miss crates? Well, it's the animal shelter, so you could pick anyone you want. My question is, you guys are looking at the 20 acres which has to be annexed, do you guys have a plan B in case that is not going to come tuition, because we need the shelter no matter what. And I understand that in 2025 our garbage issue is a problem at the shelter. I was. Which I'm not sure, are we going to still have that shelter there? Because don't we have to take our garbage back by 2025? So, Miss Kretzer, I will tell you that we are moving very quickly and we do have other options, but our goal is to have a new animal shelter by the end of 2025. And we do have options, but today, this is our plan a and this is what's on our agenda that we are. But it's possible that you do have a plan b in case. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Madam chair. Yes. You might mention that we, in terms of trying to look at the immediate situation, the rescues that's on this agenda. Thank you, mister chair. I'm sorry, Mister Pascha. Still thinking. We've had so many conversations, I don't think there's any need to go down that path at the moment. It's on this agenda. And if people have looked at this, they, and surely they have, they see what our steps are to address the issue and the partnerships that we have. But I'm going to ask if there's anyone else in the audience to come forward with an item. If not, I'm closing public comment. And I thank you for those that have come forward that's going to take us into item number three to adopt the set of minutes. I believe there are four sets of minutes I moved. Second have a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by commissioner McLean. All in favor indicate with an aye in the opposed. That motion carries unanimously nothing from our constitutional officers today. So I will now take it over to the clerk. Item number five. Thank you, madam chair. Have for the board's consideration and adoption budget amendment resolution items 511 through 5113. I would point out that four of these items relate to consent agenda items. They are 512, which relates to 751, 515 that relates to 733, 516 that relates to 792, and 517, which relates to 714 through 716. Thank you, mister clerk. I'll bring it to the board for action. So to make this easy, would any of the board members like to pull any of the corresponding items, which would be 751, 733, 792 for seven one four through 716? Would any of the board members like to move or pull any of those items? Seeing none. Hold on. That's that is one of them. Mister county administrator, you're good. Any need to pull any of those? Okay, so, madam Chair, I'd like to move up 751-73-3792 and 714 through 716 to be moved with 511 through 5113. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Bryant, for the motion to approve those items that have been listed individually. Do I have a second? 2nd by Commissioner mcLean. Any further discussion? All in favor, signify with aye. Any opposed? That motion carries. Uni. Mister Clark. Thank you. Commissioners also have for the commission's consideration and adoption, a request for disposition of property at item 521 consists of a vacuum excavator, miscellaneous equipment, items from solid waste, and miscellaneous items from our supervisor of elections. Thank you. I'll bring it to the board for action. I'll move five, two, 1 second motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Curry. All in favor, signify with aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you very much. Mister clerk. That's going to take us now to consent, and I will start to my right. Commissioner Zalick, did I hear you want 777? Sure. 777. Commissioner Bryant, you have any to pull? I'm good. Commissioner McLean. Commissioner Curry? Okay, I'll bring it back to the board then for action. Balance. Thank you. I have a motion by Commissioner Zalick, second by Commissioner Curry. Any further discussion? All in favor? Please signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Commissioner Zalick, 777. I just had a question, by the way, which one of you wonderful ladies is the person in the building? Is that you? Building. Okay. Building operations. Yeah. You know, sometimes I get you talented women confused, so I was just. I was just curious. Just jingle a little. Yeah. Sorry. Just trust them and let them do it. There you go. Oh, of course. The concept is here. Well, no, actually, I really appreciate it because you, you know, everybody in the audience, I know some of them are, you know, frustrated at the fact that they would like this thing to move faster. And I get all that. I don't think. What a lot of people realize is the fact that, you know, from what you said in last board meeting to this board meeting, the architectural is already on the agenda because of how fast you're trying to move this project through the process. So commissioner Stone commended in that regard. Thank you. To the team who's working diligently. Yeah. Plus, you know, poor angel doesn't have any nails left. I did notice he had a little bit more platinum in there, so. But I was curious, you know, one of the things that I asked myself, you know, we're gonna spend a bunch of money, $20 million on an animal shelter moving forward. You know, it's, it's, it's to me, a huge number as we consider that. I was like, I talked to angel yesterday and I honestly said, you know, we're gonna build another shelter, or I think it's better called an adoption center, to be honest with you. The way it's being designed is really Marion County's adoption center instead of a shelter or a kennel or any other thing. You know, in all honesty, I asked,",

        "text": " the commission to ultimately make that uh that determination as to whether the petition meets those four criteria i was listing um like with fsec um our process is typically considered a contested case if it actually is also going through an f-sec certification process it is just by inherently a contested case and as with an f-sec certificate ultimately the decision of for aranda an approved cpcn is appealable on an expedited path through the state supreme court where they have two months to appeal a decision and then six months from there for the state supreme court to rule on next slide um but that kind of raises the question of okay so why is the puc seeking to revise its rules um and it kind of boils down to just the fact that the existing rules are overly general um in a couple of key ways and this is a problematic for both the utilities involved and for the puc staff for the utility um that lack of clarity um is it includes the fact that they don't exactly have a clear guidance on when they should be submitting a cpcn and then in turn they don't have clear guidance on what actually needs to be in that cpcn in order to get it across the finish line and get that project approved by the poc and likewise on staff sides that lack of specificity means that they're not always completely clear on what they need to deem a petition complete and then ultimately what they need as far as information in order to address kind of all the questions that the commissioners may have around this this kind of boils down to the issue of cpcns don't come come along all that often it can be several years between one and the next at the puc which means staff turnover may have resulted in a number of people not being with the pc any longer who who would otherwise be doing this work and so you have new staff and for the utility it could be years decades in some cases there are utilities in the state who have never come before the public utility commission for a cpcn and as a result there's a lack of institutional knowledge on that side as well so that's what we're seeking to do with this rural vision next slide and so there's a whole kind of laundry list of things here um and i'm not going to read off all of them and i i kind of structured it this way to uh to go both directions which is it seems like we're making huge revisions to the rules in reality what we're doing is we're tweaking them but just kind of comprehensively throughout everywhere that they needed to provide a certain amount of information before we're being more specific about exactly what that information is supposed to be if they need previously needed to provide information about what the alternatives were to the to the proposed plan now they need to to give additional details both about alternate alternate routes that they considered but ultimately dismissed as not being the the primary uh option but also alternative non-wire solutions that they could be using to to address the same um issue that the utility is seeking to address with their transmission line um and click once more um yeah so then in addition to those kind of revisions um we'll talk about this later in my presentation here but we're also creating a waiver process around um land use uh determinations uh because uh one of the things that was lacking it was kind of a clear preference being expressed by the public utility commission as to when a cpcn would be stopped by a utility let me go to the next slide and then in addition it's kind of the dash 35 rules are being added in and this is again providing greater clarity about what are the metrics that the public utility commission the commissioners are going to be using when determining uh whether to approve a cpcn so the dash 30 rules from that i was showing on the previous slide that's about what the utility needs to be submitting in order for a petition to be considered complete um dash 35 is about what they the the kind of things they need to be hitting in order to justify the need for the cpcn also in here it's kind of highlighting outside resources including kind of fsec anything that's presented to you about the same project if it's running through both processes would also be a subject to consideration by the puc and then also highlighting just kind of how long that cpcn is good for then the dash 40 rules is actually being pulled out of the but it's also it's again it's highlighting um how land use determinations are supposed to be made what that process looks like and go on to the next slide this is the part that is kind of relevant to to you all here today um because it addresses kind of how the pucs process is going to it was currently and in the future is going to relate to fsec in this certification as it currently stands um there's no guidance as to when a utility can be submitting a cpcn petition they could have all of their permits lined up or they could have none of them they could even be asking the puc to make some of those land use determinations themselves um but there's no real guidance that's provided there and that was one of the key things that we're trying to address going forward with our revisions so we're going to go on to the next slide and but there was one thing that is in statute that was quite clear which is that if a project is going through the fsec approval process for certification then the puc has to wait to approve its own cpcn until fsec has completed its process that was the one kind of restriction and that's not going to change no one's changing the statute but what ultimately um initially what the pc was seeking to do was to make the cpcn the capstone permit that comes at the very end of the project after everything else has been all the other approvals that were necessary for this project the pc would come in at the end and make their that got a lot of pushback immediately as kind of being divorced from reality so people were made clear uh to the phd that that's not viable uh for a couple of reasons it's not particularly efficient or flexible and there are plenty of instances where a cpcn might actually be necessary in order for a local land use permit to be granted because the utility would need to have an ownership interest in the land before they're able to get be able to get the permits that they need and they can't get that ownership interest until they're able to condemn the land which requires a cpc act so that was uh a concession that in in the result um or ultimately what drove the commission to to propose that we create a waiver process on the next slide we'll go into that there's kind of stick scenarios involved um that's envisioned for how this would potentially go about um and it kind of divides a little bit in terms of does fsec have jurisdiction over this transmission line or does it fall outside of fsec but the first two scenarios are the preference for the pc we would love for a cpcn to come in at the end as was originally intended as the capstone certification they already have all the other things that they need in order um to to move forward and and we think that would make for the most expeditious process but there are potential reasons why that wouldn't uh be the case and so the scenarios three and four allow for concurrent process which means that they can submit their cpcn um ask for a waiver that waiver would would be saying we plan to get our f-sec certification we plan to get our local land use we're still in process with that but we would like to start the process with the before those things are wrapped up and if they make kind of a good argument we can move forward that way scenarios five and six are kind of that last scenario which is not just a concurrent process but they're actually asking for the pc to step in and make their own landings determination as to whether this project um can move forward um in part because they need to demonstrate that there's some kind of inhibitory permitting um that they won't be able to to uh address until they have their cpcn and so that is another kind of concession and it's kind of a higher bar to be granted that type of waiver but that's being considered going forward and we'll look back around that here in a second um we can go on to the next slide and so there's kind of benefits of risk to this kind of a waiver approach this dp that the pc is is looking to on the one hand it's more flexible it's potentially more administratively efficient that the same people who are working with ftec and working through getting the certification process there could be working with the pc at the same time um rather than having to do it kind of sequentially and then it also just kind of recognizes that there are limitations around this permitting process um that would require the pc to to not be that but it also presents certain risks in particular it's a risk because there there could be delays and potential suspensions of the process if things get hung up um and the permitting process elsewhere um and then it also potentially one kind of notable thing about the psd cpcn process is it is path dependent um it is the petition is for specific route um alternatives are considered um as part of kind of the cost benefit of is this the right plan is this the right path for the project to be taking but ultimately we're proving the the primary path that um that the utility is seeking f sec my understanding you guys could potentially approve um multiple paths um if a decided ultimately that um even though they've started this process concurrently between say fsec and the poc if they decide that they should change the route f-sec approved multiple routes or a different route um that would potentially require them to come back and revise their submission and potentially completely resubmit it um with the puc in order to get the the cpcn for the route that they are actually deciding to move forward on to the next slide um but so the one thing that we've heard and that we're still trying to iron out um is the issue of that kind of scenario five scenario six where the public utility commission is making a land use determination we don't really want to do that we don't that's not our core expertise at the puc um we uh and likewise uh we've heard from a number of",

        "text": "and thank you everyone we are resuming the meeting after our technical you know what that was my on Mike I had turned it on okay I can do a very quick because the sound on for everyone okay we are back on uh we've just concluded oral testimony for uh the second grouping and have heard from both the county and the department with regard to Umatilla County exceptions in the second grouping and we have a question or comment from Council for the county thank you Wendy Killington again representing Umatilla County there were some gratuitous statements that were made by the department that they have a question about process no I'm making an objection about the not in my backyard nature of the county standard you we have uh agreed that following the applicants opportunity for a final conclusion that the county now so address any final position so I would ask you to sort of keep a a record of of anything that you wish to raise in a responsive comment all right thank you um so at this time um for we can go to the next slide um I think to um sort of simplify the the process a little bit maybe the easiest way for the council to think of the question that we're that is being asked here is whether you accept or reject the exceptions presented by the county in this second grouping I think maybe that's the easiest way to think of it if you uh reject the exceptions presented by the county that means that you are comfortable with and agreeing with the findings of fact conclusions of Law and conditions of approval and the proposed contested case order um if you accept the exceptions or or wish to consider whether some sort of changes in order that's the other option number two so any questions before we go through that accept or reject process council member we've got everybody has comments so we can start with council members I have a question we should make a straw poll recommendation on each of the exceptions not both together yes I think I think that's cleaner I think that that makes sense thank you okay thank you councilmember Devlin question for Council Rowe and I'm going to remind you sir that you got to be here outside boys today okay thank you thank you thank you it's tied up now for 21 years uh in the legislature my role was to debate what the law should be in various areas that's no longer my um it wasn't my role when I was served on the northwest power and conservation Council there I had to follow all applicable federal and state laws and here I have to follow probably all federal and state laws also but in a sense I'm not here to say what the law should be I'm here to say what the law what I believe the law is we have special advisory groups whenever we have a proposal like this coming my limited understanding from my short period of time of service on this body is those are normally a governmental entity and most commonly accounting actually um haven't we previously ever accepted as a required land use requirement something that wasn't required by the Statewide goals um meaning in this case what the county is asserting is although this does not actually be one of the required things from the Statewide goals that a governmental body would have to do they have indicated in the special Advisory Group that this should be a required standard but have we ever done that I think it's certainly possible that we have in this instance the applicant pointed out to the department that they they were they believed that the setback was not required so because the applicant pointed that out the department conducted that analysis and agreed with the applicant but it's certainly possible that there are other ordinances that local jurisdictions have recommended but no one the applicant hasn't objected so the department in deference to its partnership with the local governments has agreed that they should be applied thank you council member condom um thank you I have a question of our Council and we've chosen to do this in public and I am curious what council's council uh consider if you considered the information read through the documents um can you just um you know my sense is that um this issue of whether applicable substitute criteria in this case include Criterion um has been pretty well vetted by the by the parties in the sense that there was extensive briefing um and as I read the alj's proposed contested case order um it seems to me to be on very Solid Ground as far as its basis and both the language of the statute and the Oregon Supreme Court case that confirms that it's important to read the whole language of the statute in the sense that the phrase applicable sensitive criteria that you the council are required to apply are those that are required by Statewide planning goals at you know at the end of the day the standard that the council is applying Landy standard requires you to find Finance with the Statewide planning um you know as uh the materials presented by the department briefed For Better or Worse the Oregon legislature has developed this uh energy facility citing Council to act at the Statewide level um you know to process applications for certain energy facilities that's what you're doing the standard that has been established and the law appears quite clearly to be compliance with Statewide planning goals and when an applicant demonstrates that through compliance with applicable substitute criteria those are the applicable substitute criteria required by Statewide planning goals um so I I guess um I think you can have confidence in the I certainly think that the reasoning and the proposed contestant case order Is On Solid Ground thank you um Vice chair Hal I want to put you on the spot but and you can say well not Patrick mentioned uh Council mentioned um previously we had dialogue about this when the former chair Haley Jenkins was here he comes from a land use background like you and and councilmember buyer if I recall from reading and let's all re remember this is a voluminous amount of information so if I'm airing I apologize but I believe one of the comments summarized that you and chair Jenkins held a similar position am I just okay thank you it's just for me to remember what I was reading so thank you are there other questions comments Vice chair how I just make a comment in that I have a long history and County Planning Landis planning and I know that according to the statutes we have to adopt regulations at it at a minimum apply the land use regulations that the states requiring counties can be more restrictive but they can't be less restricted but in this instance to me the county is being more restrictive but it's not required it's at their choice and what we have to apply is what's required by the statutes and they have gone above and beyond that so that's that's my opinion thank you any other comments questions okay Council I look at you now yeah um I guess we'll go to uh exception B2 um and maybe it would make sense to turn the slide back so that that is um can you go back I think it might be two slides okay so these are the two exceptions that we just heard from the county and the department regarding and discussed we'll take the first one B2 and the question and I would pose for purposes of the straw poll is is whether you're inclined to accept or reject the County's exception that you see there do you want us to I think we are yeah in the spirit of the straw poll checking in to see where everyone is um is there anyone who's who's leaning towards accepting it or wishes to discuss that okay so maybe we can just hear from me too yeah bye share health I would reject uh B2 that sounds like council member bye I also would reject B2 and thanks to both the parties for giving us their briefing thank you councilmember Devlin I would reject B2 uh from the county but I would also State for the record uh that uh I know that there has been this discussion this is going into that other area I said is no longer my purview is that uh I know there's been a discussion of having a Statewide goals more effectively address siding of energy facilities and uh I believe ultimately uh there should be some more Authority at the local level uh that actually is implemented through Statewide goals but it but it is not actually there now so uh we are limited to what is actually required by the Statewide goals so I will reject the 32 I too reject B2 thank you I reject relations yesterday okay and we'll ask those the same question with regard to the County's exception B3 any anyone uh inclined to accept trying to streamline this I don't usually run the straw polls I'm open to suggestions on that Bridge you know it's good to hear from yeah um the record okay so Vice chair health I would reject B3 as well thank I would reject as well I would reject B3 as well but just recognizing that this in no way undermines the role of the special advisory groups which we rely on for advice on locally applicable criteria so even though there would be a rejection of this particular exception we we as a council truly re need and the department does as well the the recommendations from the special Advisory Group thank you well said reject thank you council member Truitt yep reject B3 when I typically and I do emphasize council member buyers thank you okay I think if we move yes this is the third grouping uh this six different uh exceptions presented by the county so on the timeline we have scheduled for a break right now however I would recommend that we continue until we time out and maybe take a break at that point I think we all concur present in the room are shaking we're going to keep trucking power through okay okay so we'll move to the what we've characterized as the third grouping of the County's exceptions um that relate you know they're all a little bit different and we'll hear from the county regarding each of them but they relate to what I characterized um in my initial overview as the uh suspenders portion of the proposed contested a case order in which the alj concluded that even though in her opinion Criterion 3 is not in this case an applicable substitute criteria that it's prudent for the council to nonetheless have an alternative finding that the project does apply it does comply with Statewide planning goals and that portion of the statute I think we'll hear from the parties of I'll let them direct you to which provisions of the statute relate to this in particular um I think in the interest of moving through this efficiently it probably doesn't make sense for me to read all six of these because we'll have forgotten what the",

District 3 representative which is Mike McKillip Mike has served on the commission for a very long time he is on our budget committee he said he'd be willing to serve one more term and as move forward those are the only three applicants we got uh despite promotion through Joe's uh Community Connection piece and our other Outreach pieces um so what we're asking is if you're good with that we would come back with a formal appointment meeting on the 26th Mike really has been uh a long time contributor and I think this lines up well so that uh when there's the new incoming District 3 commissioner there will be the opportunity uh for that new commissioner to do an appointment uh and take advantage of new contacts there uh Alan Jesse I've had past experience with him through the Hillsborough training program and great resource and Terry we've gotten to see in our budget committee meetings as well so yeah we have three three solid contributors well thank you very much we will back be back for the formal action on the 26th great thank you and I know there are a bunch of topics that we're seeking advisement done from sea whack so uh it'll be it'll be fun to have some uh informal time with them at the function this Thursday thanks commissioner Willie for getting me anchored on this week versus it being sometime in the future so it'll be fun to to talk with them and now we're going to switch to an entirely different subject garbage that's right well good morning chair Harrington Board of County Commissioners my name is Mira samantel I use your pronouns I'm the director of Health and Human Services as the chair said we we are here uh to talk about garbage specifically an overview of Metro's garbage and recycling system facilities planning effort and any facility gaps within Washington County and to ensure our community has Equitable access to these essential services so I will turn it over to our fantastic Solid Waste and Recycling division manager Tom Eggleston thanks Mira good morning chair Harrington Board of Commissioners as mayor mentioned we're here today to chat about the Metro garbage and recycling facility system plan that is currently under development you all received an email probably about a month ago with an invitation to a symposium on September 27th it raised some really good questions and we sent some information to your board and your chair requested a work session on this topic so we're here today to fulfill that request and talk about this facility system plan and then discuss how we want to engage in the planning process and provide our input as staff and as your board members as well so we'll get started quick overview of the agenda the purpose and desired outcome we'll go over our policy questions we're posing uh to facilitate this conversation a little bit of background about the some an overview of some of the gaps that have been identified in the planning process and staff have been raising with Metro over the years um some an overview of scenarios that Metro has developed they I will give you a disclaimer that they have slightly changed since the initial draft scenarios that were provided to us the ones in the Cornelius one no no no it's still on the table but um the initial scenarios that were shared at a regional waste advisory committee meeting in July are different than the ones you'll see on September 27th and in the packet are the newer ones that you'll see on September 27th so we're all working on the same Playbook not the old Playbook yeah I jumped out of my skin when I I didn't realize they were draft they'll still they'll still look okay well let's see if I can stay in my chair today uh so we'll talk about the scenarios I have a handout for all of you so if you don't have it printed like we can pass those around that's an overview of the scenarios themselves and then we'll talk about providing feedback continue to step out for public practice um so a quick overview of our purpose here and the desired outcome here our purpose is to provide your board an overview of the facility system plan development review the identified gaps in the plan and discuss ingredients engagement strategies to support our community and our desired outcome is your board is updated on this planning effort we've identified we identify those critical elements necessary to fill the gaps in Washington County and we make sure to make sure that our community has Equitable access our sync policy questions are what garbage and recycling facility gaps are the most critical to address to ensure Washington County community members have Equitable access to essential services and how should your board and staff Advocate or facility system plan that serves our so a little bit of background on the facility system plan this plan is really focused on uh facilities that are transfer or intermediate solid wasting facilities so these are places that are garbage trucks deliver Recycling and solid waste too before they go to final disposal so the transfer station is a place where they consolidate materials they might segregate and sort materials and then from there it goes to final disposal this is one of the key roles Metro plays in our system in managing and regulating these intermediary um this plan is intended to drive future Investments that that Metro is going to make over the next 20 years including up to building new facilities potentially or adding new services to existing facilities or updating and identifying alternative ways to provide services through their regulatory Authority or with local governments um the plan is going to really be guided by reducing waste through either infrastructure improvements improving quality and access of services or can keeping Services affordable is kind of their an overview of the project they have five stages in the project the first stage is values and out defining values and outcomes that was conducted in the spring of 2022 Metro did some engagement work with Community groups and their Council to really identify the values and outcomes for this plan the second stage was to conduct a gap analysis that was done through Community engagement work commissioner Teresa and I participated in a community engagement session last October to identify some of the gaps we're hearing in Washington County they met with Community groups they also did a technical analysis on some gaps and then they are now in stage three where they're choosing a preferred set of Investments to address those gaps and they're building these scenarios so we have these four scenarios that have been developed as potential ways to address some of the gaps they've identified going from there will be a funding plan and metrics to track progress towards their goal and then finally they're planning to look into the spring of 2024 for Metro Council adoption of a plan so getting to Washington County and some of the facility gaps in Washington County and these Echo true to what we've heard from our community and we've been advocating to Metro for a long time affordable garbage and dry waste disposal is a significant Gap in our community we'll talk a little bit more about this one specifically and the second one accessible household hazardous waste disposal is another significant Gap in our community and then they've also identified that reuse outlets and Mattress and building material reuse in particular are also things that we don't see much of on the West Side most of that's Consolidated Portland metro again east side of the department area um zooming in on the hHw which is our acronym for household hazardous waste you can see that there are two permanent facilities in the Metro region that collect household hazardous waste from community members those facilities are in Northwest Portland in the industrial area co-located with Metro Central and the other one is in Oregon City at Metro South here are those tiny orange dots and you'll see the shading indicates how long it takes the average Community member to get to one of these facilities the darkest shade is over 25 minutes I think it's safe to say that Washington County community members have a hard time accessing household hazardous waste um they either have",

consider the amendments of the urban authorities of plans and capital plan capital funds for the development of housing let's start that hearing with public testimonies the testimonies individual personal extend more than three minutes we can have a staff presentation good night Commissioners I am Melanie Fletcher administrator of the authorities of Come out let's talk about our agency of public housing or pH plan to which You know what the agency is public housing is something we do every year we are going to send it to the housing development unit that this plan this year will indicate the different activities we plan put into practice in the next year under this plan first of all simply to give you an overview for those who are not familiar with these documents administrative the pH plan to our guide to programs operations and strategies for our needs and housing goals each year we have to deliver a pH plan and every five years we have to send one more plan complete that year is an annual plan for It is a smaller plan and we we have to have a meeting and have feedback before delivering that plan and submit it for approval as the agency we are going to give them more information about it We also have to deliver in addition to that plan annually what do we plan to do in the coming months to see assignments and that is why that process we had our meeting in June 2023 we did not have any comment on the housing plan but to ensure that we have a great network in this process we made a survey and We had a survey with property-owning residents managers and staff about our move towards this supplement for somehow leverage the public sentiment about what we want to do and understand it better So first of all I'll start with the agency's plan it has not changed Generally from last year's plan basically we still have plans that can we're going to have to eliminate some dwellings mainly houses that They have different maintenance units difficult to maintain because are located throughout the jurisdiction they are going to have to and not if we we gave to the authority vouchers those programs so that they continue getting support Just not in that one unit and in fact it is a gain for housing societies because we receive those vouchers for those residents And so do we we have funds from the sale of those units to replace them with something that be more sustainable for the future and We will see a net gain in the units supported by salt of me Kaiser We are also open or is one we have a plan during the last four years of having that suffering to fulfill the calendar year projects for And That hasn't changed over the years of others planned activities deliver our first supplement to the para plan move and do activities for the year incoming going towards move towards work or mtw is a program for housing authorities that allows us test solutions and that provides an opportunity to have that financing and then we have various financings and we can put it in a place to be able to spend them like and how they are required And that requires that the authorities get involved activities to find employment and be the most self-sufficient and continued maintaining housing options for participants and have exemptions from many of the regulations and provides flexibility of financing and we move towards agency in September in what is called the court of assets and what it means asset construction cut allows you to create a new benefit savings for participants program will be chosen that is why requirements that must be establish there will not be any of expenses or having to work jobs and self participation required for participants and the exam In that demo program is going to allow having more assets more excess active for homes and low-rise houses income we are going to do it Through it which is called a savings plan decide not to take it because families They are going to decide whether to take them but yes they decide not to participate they are going to decide not participate we are going to give and then we are going to have that excess towards savings and we are going to provide ourselves as a savings account that will improve During one year, that is, the amount of amount reaches 120 dollars then can access funds AND then we will have that statute and we are going to have that program we are going to have other incentives to have that background to be able to access those funds and we are going to have that program bumps and finally we will have seven that is disabled and the dead that are linked other than those at the entry of their houses or increase in rents, which we are going to do is help a hundred homes up to more up to one hundred homes that savings program tells us that 70 percent of people who decide decide the program they are going to save and generally there are three thirty that do not ask for that support is almost 70% is the people that we serve what we are going to do the plan is to do that first deposit of 120 dollars so that there is no period for people may have we are going to have an investment of $2,420 for a period of two years but we are going to see a partner bank that can balance those funds and research when they have access has shown that low-income families income when three can survive four months which is four thousand five thousand dollars It has an impact long-term well-being and mobility economically the budget does not allow us reach that control mark and five thousand dollars we want to find a partner bank that allows us those amounts and in addition to the savings program where it is decided to take it, not take it, we have other activities to reach the hud goals for program demonstration we want to reduce the cost AND we are effective in terms of expenses but that we be good fund administrators we want provide incentives to participants working people looking for work participate in training or education and we are going to increase the housing option for those participating in the Y program We are also wanting to provide the economic mobility the ability to people to improve their situation economical over time and I want to get into those activities proposals the first is a permit we are going to have to give a program for light water phone we have to What are they lights or phone not in use often involves a lot of numbers that are difficult to add we have to remember many numbers and we are looking for housing it becomes very complex there is a lot of room for errors it is difficult to explain to participants so that they can find housing that meets with these eligibility criteria So we give him money so that consider all the rates of these suppliers within their jurisdictions",

for a while and you're saying I'm not here but I'm here okay you ready we've got you now okay good evening good evening my name is Fuji krier f uji k r eii d r 60366 Marvin Road LR Oregon uh I'd like to speak tonight as a community-minded and engaged Oregonian most of you know me as a member of the stop be2 Coalition but I'm not speaking on behalf of the Coalition tonight we just didn't have the time or the bandwidth for this but I want to speak to some some things um just as a citizen we have a huge Collective problem it's called climate change we also have long-standing traditions and laws in our state for land use planning and protection of our natural and cultural resources can these be addressed with the same Solutions or is one ordained to overshadow the others my comment tonight is not exclusively of this RFA 1 but I will get there first I want to address the council with a plea that I am sure the staff will say is out of your jurisdiction have you driven around you matilla Maro counties in a while I urge you to do so you will see the willy-nilly stringing of transmission lines and access roads obviously a product of Peace mu facility sighting then trying to stitch it all together with transmission lines and substations once the developer gets a site certificate the Amendments just keep coming there's a lack of certainty that the the county planners can get from fsac and the agencies keep approving projects and allowing amendments to expand facilities so that multiple ones overlap essentially for sighting what can you as the energy facility sighting council do to help Oregon reach its decarbonization goals and ensure an adequate energy Supply while safeguarding Oregon's environment public health and safety the latter is as your mission States unfort you're limited in your ability to accomplish this Mission I have come to the conclusion having engaged in nepsac for years that you are too Limited in your standards based decision-making to make the best decisions for the people wildlife and even developers your decision-making approach is too siloed within the standards you cannot talk about cumulative impacts because you don't have a standard for that you cannot discuss climate change or climate related impacts to soils or other resources because you don't have a standard for that the solutions we need to assure our energy supplies are complex too complex for decision- making to operate in a silo of rules and standards we need at least one additional standard as soon as possible ASAP and that is cumulative impact the feds have it in their NEPA processes and many other state agencies consider it as well that fsac does not without it you can see the results fragmentation just drive around like I said to be fair some of this has also been the results of the counties and individuals request or just request for revenue from sighting energy facilities and data centers umil Electric Co-op has become the largest carbon-based electrical supplier per customer in the state almost all for data centers with their green environmental standards it's ironic a renewable energy facilities next to Data Centers and we need to import carbon-based energy now that's planning it's not all your sighting decisions that got us to this place however now with this RFA 1 I urge you to reconsider the siloed thinking and Analysis for the good of the people and our resources the wheat rdge East facility has not been built the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line has not been built B2 has amendments pending and there will likely be more for both of these projects before they break ground they are both working in the same area what would be in the best interest of possibly all developers in the area but certainly in the Public's interest would be to direct the developers to communicate at minimum share information as much as possible Andor at best actually try to work out a win-win win-win situation with the developers the land owners the interest groups and the state possibly co-locating transmission corridors or other ways they could reduce the cumulative impact to both fragmentation of farms and natural res resources thank you for listening thank you comment thank you Miss crder for being here and providing testimony council members any questions thank you one last call for okay no comments from the council so um as previously stated the comment deadline is April 4th at 5:00 pm the certificate holder will be given until Monday April 8th at 5:00 pm to provide responses to comments however if requested by the certificate holder the department is authorized to grant them additional time to respond and does the certificate holder have any fur comment tonight in response to the comments made by the public just so that it's on the record yeah yeah no thank you not at this time uh we thank everyone for their comments and we'll be reviewing them and providing written response so thank you thank you thank you very much for being here so chair Conan yes um are you going to do Council comments soon or did you already I I thought I already did it but if there are Council comments counselor comments please go right ahead perfect thank you chair um I do have a comment regarding um wildfire um in the DPO under o 34221 one5 um you'll see the staff's um recommendations there um for Wildfire mitigation and and um specifically my comments are um about procedure standards time frame excuse me um time frames that the applicant will use to inspect the facility components and manage vegetation in the areas identified under subsection a um I found when we reviewing that section um there was a lack of detail um specific quickly on page five of the um wildfire mitigation plan um I think it's attachment H in the um section 3.2.2 um the applicant must provide operational procedures and inspections um and when those when we get to that point in there um it doesn't have very much information um or of quite a bit of lack of evidence um on what the plan is also in section 3.25 on page8 um there is some information provided on training um but the training refers to a a program um known as race and it's um in that program there's no evidence that local respond responders will be included in the training or in the site inspection or how often the trainings will occur or who will be responsible for the race program um I'm also wondering about the local capacity the the the local fire responders and what their capacity is to be able to respond to fires um and how they've been engaged in the um also in your Wildfire mitigation um plan there was no mention of routine anchor bolts inspection um I also want to point out that um it's interesting I'm new here by the way and so this is my first time um looking at um two amendments side by side um and I noticed with the prior Amendment with leaning juder that their fire wild mitigation plan was much more comprehensive than the one that we're reviewing in the Wheat Ridge East um Amendment so um I I see some inconsistencies there across the board and that does concern me um this is a new well the wellfire is a new standard and so I can understand that it's probably challenging for um Consultants to navigate that new standard um but at the same time I think it's very important that we have a um consistent Baseline approach to these fire mitigation plans when they're presented to the council and and the staff for review as well and I know that takes a a team effort with staff and um the consultant so uh those are my comments for today thank you thank you for those comments counselor IMS and because that was a comment made after would you like to respond the h s the certificate okay right um thank you very much for that so now it is now 7:59 pm. on March 21st 2024 and the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the weat ridge renewable energy East amendment number one is now closed the public comment period will will close on April 4th 2024 at 5:00 p.m. the time is now still 7:59 p.m. and the March 21st mad if I may before we conclude um in recess for tomorrow um I would just like to acknowledge in the audience longtime energy facilities hiding council member Brian wolf also long-term chair of the energy facility sighting Council Brian wolf so just wanted to get on the record that uh Mr Wolf is in the audience we appreciate um his being here tonight thank you very much yes thank you for being here um so I'm not sure I finished my statement so um The Time Is Now 8 o'clock um pm and the March 21st 22nd 2024 meeting of the energy facility sighting council is now recessed until tomorrow morning at 8:30 a. thank you thank you all for being here",

        "text": " it has been the problem most important for several years in the community satisfaction cost there is desperate need for more housing in Oregon especially in Salem I saw that Salem is experiencing an affordable housing boom that name of the article and it was very good being able to meet with my colleagues in the council and with you mayor go on a tour to the rivenwood department, what's going to be in so that people have was where Norstrom was going to have 160 units of housing and 10 or 15 of them are defined like affordable homes that's a big one step and it really was amazing to have that tour and see the progress that was made on the community and that same day we we went to the opening of eh redwood Crossing We are commissioners like this authority uh and we see the progress and with 60 undefined units they are also coming online that are online as of now So if we go to those two events really signal the progress we've made achieved by speaking listening to Salem speakers is one of the cities We have seen the increase in people they experience not having houses and now it's falling so this us it encourages enormously it is incredible power things go and we can't always do it do but really as to traffic safety I think they are the two reasons and we can make one difference and in our security of traffic and one of the most terrible things I have seen is for example members who did not survive due to a car accident I feel like There are ways to design the infrastructure of who ahead to reduce it and We have adopted policies as advice to see a reduction in speeds of residential streets and build infrastructure with the objective of not have no fatality and did it eh has spoken to you with the president stapleton and with the mayor to follow Go ahead with this security plan that It is commercial and it is 35 miles now 40 in the southern part and I also think which is the south part of Brown Street avenue cobler va 35 a 40 miles per hour and we on the committee We saw the index where many of the uh deaths happen incidents of accidents and it is the commercial part from the south and it is as bad as other parts like Lancaster but I also think that the neighborhood association supports unanimously will continue adante with that security plan to reduce speed from 40 miles to 35 miles time I don't have a motion prepared in this moment but I'm going to make sure this is given and also make a motion in the future I just want people to be by following up I know so as not to take them by surprise to see who we can talk outside of these meetings officials and I think it is very important I'm tired of seeing the deaths that I have seen by seeing in the south part of Salem and I will be a very important step to make it a safer place Thank you counselor someone else counselor nishioka yes mayor today I also wanted to thank Councilor Steton for making a comment on the number of calls and emails that have come about eh situation of never Israel and I respect and I appreciate that many people have approached me too but again we me and we really don't we are in a position to take a position in this regard on this issue I just wanted to say that yes I listen and I also wanted to tell you that I was invited and I had the opportunity to talk to a graduate program in Uh University of Salem Campus Western Oregon University uh it was a class and talked about my experience as being a city councilor had many questions for me it was a great pleasure to have spoken with that class Thank you very much someone else and advisor nordik yes thank you good afternoons and counselors eon and nishioka and es very painful to see what is happening in the very painful world and yet we are in a very limited position where we meet and a couple of other things What I wanted to point out, I attended recently to a service event with counselor nishioka and counselor barne was there too then city \u200b\u200bhad funds that and accounts banking on $35,000 in which we have provided towards buying a van to help people who have problems in situation street in the Lo Que Fue community incredible part of that meeting was hearing the impact that that vehicle uh is having they go a have support they have different professionals and human services that they have supported huh support trauma cases and residents vulnerable that they already mentioned They served about 400 people in this period for which those funds 135,000 were available for 400 people served has a great impact and I ask the service staff northwestern humans who are supporting without naming names what demographics they are seeing there in the field when they go out to people's camps in street situation and park etc. they serve the elderly they serve the children serve people He was recently taken out of the hospital. with amputations they serve everyone age spectrum and it is difficult to imagine in a city with so much prosperity that we have children in street situations older adults living on the streets any Ah age of people who have problems that have basic needs fundamentals and care with eh different types of wounds and street situation is not just eh unique for Or the valley of Salem when we see opportunities to support and provide services to people who are struggling with your medical needs with your eh low pressure eh infections, cleaning your wounds and They try to live on the street and outside it is an important reflection of where they should to be our values \u200b\u200bfor me we have to triangulate resources and see Who are the most vulnerable in the community and how to serve them first and are happy to be part of it and there are a story behind these 135,000 which is more suitable for another moment but I hope we can attend in a small capacity to a team of civilian based crisis that is different than the one in our agenda tonight there are times when where the best answer and the most right is a police officer and there is moments when the best response and more appropriate is a social worker and I have defended having the tool right for the right job and I will continue doing it and in other news A The best thing they saw was that one of our local representatives and alumni of eh that represent Tommy Anderson has presented the preliminary housing project in the legislature that is an iteration idea that the mayor has tried for years to allow that we recover some type of income of the large amount of real estate in our area there are large users of our security services use our streets use our parks They walk to the same places eat what I do and when they call 91 expect the same answer as me If you follow it, it is a project please listen to his voice and also I invite you to educate yourselves short session is called short for one reason is going to be here and it started and it's going to go in no time And this is one of many opportunities for us we can all support and so that we I hope we have more income, it's not going to solve all our problems but again this eh eh draft law hey google and say you support this one measure and I think it will have an impact very important Thank you counselor I was going to mention it as part of the comments is that in this draft of law representing Tommy Anderson and Pat Anderson and Patterson and the Representative Kevin Mado dill I think it's this thing about the group that testified so it is very good to have several of our delegation Legislators supporting this project of law and we hope that we resolve something but like the counselor said nordik is in a short session and Let's hope that everyone listens to our voices any other comments Thanks to everyone and now is the time Sorry I had something else Now what we have is the eh the city manager but we have to some one of our managers city \u200b\u200band decided to stay at home and not share with and share with us and it is time for statements I am going to invite nishioka because she's going to mess us up through that statement for health month eh children's oral cavity and I know that it will invite many children to invite some people to talk about it dental care and dental health for children Yes many thank you very much thank you all thank you eh is surprised yes we are ready in first of all I wanted to tell you that I I was in the profession I was a dentist for more than 30 years and I continue proudly feeling very connected with good dental health and I asked him a calde jooy If I could have one statement for health month dental for children that is in February uh at the national level and I contacted pola Hendrix, who is the assistant director? of the program of the Technical Institute of Oregon from the Salem fields which is a program that provides a bachelor's degree to dental hygienists in our city Salem and on campus It's really a very good combination of having university and technical institute of Oregon working together and also we have the dental assistance program which is in chimera and we also have Jodie Loper who is the clinical director for the boys and girls club for the dental health program for children and girls So I just wanted to give you the welcome points out the things that are doing and then providing that statement and I'm going to give you the microphone to each of them after talking about your considerations eh considering that the well-being and health of children Oregon is one of the responsibilities most important since they are the future of this state and a very component important to the general health of the children is dental health while cavities is one of the diseases more severe chronic conditions found in children while good habits oral health begins in childhood and brush your teeth twice using toothpaste cleaning flossing having reviews dental by drinking water that has levels adequate flouride and eating a diet that has little sugar and also low sugar drinks Meanwhile educators and tutors are educated about dental health they will adapt oral hygiene and behaviors eh diets and dating dentists and can be achieved through good dental habits learned since early reinforced throughout life and for this reason Chris Ho and the mayor of the city \u200b\u200bof Salem proclaims the month of February 2024 as health month for children in the city of Salem Oregon and invites everyone to",

        "text": "to formation could bring about additional obstacles to investment in transmission and the state instead should focus on streamlining the approval of new transmission assets generator interconnection open access current generation interconnection process attempts to equitably allocate the risks of cost recovery but there may be improvements uh under an rto efficiency rto may more efficiently manage qr projects regionally particularly when a project in one utilities queue might impact a project in a queue of another utility interconnection cues um this one came out several times that kind of this is a recurring theme we'll hear is that an rfto might not solve all our problems right our geo formation would not automatically resolve full generator interconnection cues as utility would still be obligated to coordinate through affected system studies but it was noted that rto designed to ensure projects are built on reasonable timelines and don't hold up the queue and that including a cluster study approach to process requests could help manage the queue so that's certainly something that's done in other regions standardization an rto could standardize interconnection through its tariffs and business practices to ensure uniformity across a broad area uh one commenter believes this will likely help a greater diversity of resources interconnect multiple commenters believe this will reduce biases for utility on resources and standardization can establish a predictable consistent process across the region that improves upon the inefficient and effective status coil with a particular node there of long interconnection queues and high deposits specifically for smaller projects cost allocation uh for new transmission existing rtos have also struggled to plan for and allocate costs for major new transmission lines uh but one commenter suggested both the problems in the rtos are better problems to have an oregon status quo with separate quote transmission fighters one view uh the status quo effectively has quote no regional mechanism for cost allocation which hampers the development of desperately needed new transmission but another view cost allocation has not been the largest hurdle to new transmission development and the costs of project spanning multiple entities are handled through bilateral transactions process rto structure should be rooted in cost causation principles and should include a collaborative process for accepting or disputing an rto's determination of transmission benefit permitting one commenter noted there are often risks associated with the allocation of the costs of the time and effort associated with permitting transmission projects and more on cost allocation here benefits uh ferc order 1000 requires cost allocation to go to customers that receive the benefit from the transmission project and rto design can require required transmission benefit analysis to reduce the potential for non-benefiting customers to bear costs but who benefits i was raised that some projects such as segments designed to accidents access new renewable resource zones may arguably benefit all customers so some difficulty there experience from other rtu shows more success in developing large transmission projects that benefit a broad base of customers expand multiple utility service territories identifying the indirect benefits of a transmission project such as congestion to particular customers may be easier within an rto and then transmission planning northern grid as uh commissioner tony reviewed earlier uh works with jurisdictional utilities to meet their transmission planning compliance obligations provide common data and a single stakeholder forum uh one commenter however described northern grid's planning process as quote a long staple that collates individual transmission plans rather than providing a regional view and optimization of transmission lack of transmission development since 2012 despite utilities identifying it as a reliability need is evidence that quote the status quo for transmission planning is not working uh optimization the optimization of existing resources in an rto could delay or avoid the regional need to plan and build some transmission projects but the impacts could vary significantly depending on the size of the region non-wires an rto transmission planning process should evaluate non-wire congestion charges depending on how rto is designed congestion price signals can be an important tool to identify the need to plan for additional transmission given significant barriers to transmission development including sliding and permitting and rto transmission planning effort likely requires a 20-year planning horizon note about path capacity transitioning from a contract to a flow-based methodology for calculating atc may identify more available transmission in the transmission planning process an expansion uh one commenter suggested an rto could be designed to attract investors to develop interregional projects identified by a regional planning process uh best practices regional transmission planning should evaluate transmission projects as multi-value projects with a broad range of benefits incorporate a least regrets evaluation of risk when assessing new investments and determine cost allocation on the basis of total benefits across the entire portfolio and i think this is the last topic we have here legacy transmission rights uh as previously noted in our first meeting uh commenter raised the energy policy act of 2005 which prevents the forced conversion of existing physical transmission rights to financial rights comparison to other rtos while other rtos have addressed legacy rights this could be more complicated in the northwest due to the manner in which bpa markets the output from the federal columbia river power system as a single and some trans transmission customers have designated that resource that power system as a as their network resource one commenter noted however that this type of conversion is quite a known process that can achieve beneficial even though there may be challenges in and a mitigation measure it was noted that when portion of wapa joined spp it set aside transmission used to serve its preference customers to shield them from transmission rate impacts from joining the rto and multiple commenters note that without more specific details it would be impossible to evaluate whether conversion of legacy transmission rights would be a net benefit to oregonians so that was a lot of me talking uh hopefully we can get some conversation here i reviewed a lot of material there so again i'll reiterate the kind of uh standard questions i'm gonna ask on each one of these topics do you support or oppose a particular perspective would you emphasize something differently is there something missing that's sort of a catch-all question and then i have a couple of other questions i have here i've built off of the feedback the comments um incremental approaches to regionalization seem to focus more on energy markets in ra that's my editorial comment how much urgency is there to further integrate regional transmission planning so that comment came up that maybe there's more that could be done on uh transmission planning regionally and then legacy transmission rights um certainly the voluntary nature of it is but wondering if uh any thought or uh can you describe what it would take to consider voluntarily converting those rights to financial rights or a process or steps or what does that framework for analysis look like so with that i will look for uh feedback and input on any any or all of these questions or one that i haven't asked here or anything else you saw on the hey adam this is nicole um in the topic of something missing uh i didn't see a discussion of pancake and i don't know maybe if that's dealt with elsewhere so if you recall a lot the previous question was on transmission rates that we had a discussion of that at our first meeting um it didn't didn't show up in this once i think most commenters put that discussion in the previous the responses to the previous question question five okay i mean i do think it's still relevant to this overall transmission planning concept i another thing i'd like to hear others um feedback on is you know we in in all the irps that we look at we see issues related to transmission lack of transmission transmission congestion there's really no solution to solve those right now i mean near term there could be some efforts at bpa to work towards working with utilities in the region to relieve some of the requirements to move you know more atc and maybe relieve some of the requirements on conditional firm to to help move more energy around but long term there is no solution to this and so i think transmission is actually going to become the driving factor in states like oregon meeting their 100 percent clean goals and so i see the benefit of moving towards coordinated regional transmission planning as a way to really narrow in on where exactly the transmission congestion issues are and then also have a regional cost process for for funding the relief of those transmission i don't see any new transmission being built in in our region in the near term other than those projects that have been planned and are sort of sitting in the process for unless we can get agreement that these projects are important on a regional so i'd like to hear what others think about that yeah um nicole this is frank i i actually think the transmission is the key to make this this whole thing um in it and i would agree with everything you said um i would say that the benefits are not limited to oregon they're they're limited to the re their their for the whole region and it it seems like there are a number of utilities who who recognize this as a as a bottleneck but they're waiting for someone else to make a move or they're you know it's it's i think a colleague of mine described it as sort of utility chicken you know who's who's gonna make the first move and it does seem like there's so many complexities to this and and just based on the roster of things adam that you just presented there's there's a whole bunch that goes into but it's really really important to facilitate the investments to optimize the operation so that we can move to a more renewable portfolio across the region if we want to leverage the diversity across the region you have to be able to effectively interconnect it and right there's not enough momentum moving that direction just on our own as utilities and so especially you know you look at this and appreciate uh commissioner tawny's uh recognition that there's 30 30 plus bas um all kind of doing their own thing when we're trying to leverage the diversity of a region so this is incredibly important there's a lot of complexity to it uh but i would i would say that if if oregon washington if we all want to get where we need to go from a from a grid this particular issue is is probably a number one from my perspective and frank you um follow a question there that's irrespective of an rto i assume rto or not all right that need exists yeah and i and i think what the what an rto can do is first of all can provide better visibility as to the priorities to make that happen which then can facilitate the investments and equitably share that cost and benefit across the region but without that it's it's too distributed and as individuals we probably don't always see those returns or",

        "text": " oregon in the northwest but i make do with what i've got uh so right so electricity is generated at power plants sent across the transmission distribution system balanced in real time also then when you hit that switch in your house the lights come on at the instant uh you want the electricity right uh some people call it the greatest most advanced machine in human history and it's kind of hard to argue right but this type of real-time generation delivery and balancing has to happen 24 hours a day seven days a week every month of the year right so take a look at what this actually looks like on uh you know a hypothetical utility system here i'm showing three uh hours one through 24 in the day on the x-axis hypothetical demand on the y this is showing the orange line a typical summer day blue a typical winter and then you see you know what you might get on an extremely cold snap in the winter here on say a cold january day so let's let's take a look at what this looks like you know think about your own electricity usage right how it varies throughout the year you know it's certainly lowest while you're sleeping at night especially in the summer and you know but then you have those cold winter mornings where you really crank up your heat and of course those afternoons like we had last june 116 and we're all firing up the air conditioning right so utilities have to manage all these ups and downs rapid fluctuations and aggregate across all its customers at all times so here's a snapchat this is actually actual data now from uscia showing these curves um averaged across the across the year in the northwest so you can see quite a bit of variation right between that peak you might see at six pm on a july afternoon versus what you'd see on a october morning mild october morning right so quite a big variation all right so now i'm going to have a little bit of fun i think todd may have seen these in the past but um i'm going to compare electricity to milk and figure out what's missing because i think it's it's so simple but it's something i just want to highlight because i think it really it's a fundamental driver of a lot of what happens in our industry right so some of you may have had a bowl of cereal uh this morning for breakfast somewhat of an american tradition you know let's walk through the steps for how that milk was produced and delivered to serve your demand right there's milk production capacity of course begins with cows although it could easily be a almond tree or oats or the milk has a standard distribution all right i think we're all familiar with this that's how we all get our milk right and then you have your your end use consumption right so it's a lot like electricity so let's compare it to electricity right so you wake up yeah you pour a bowl of cereal you'll walk to your front door the milk you need is produced in real time by that cow right delivered in real time to your door right by the by the milkman now oprah's getting skeptical by right you open your front door and receive that fresh cold milk and you pour it on your milk and enjoy right so it all happens in real time just just like electricity right so of course it doesn't right it's uh but the reality here is trying to point out just how unique electricity really is right and so what's missing um i i suggest something pretty simple and that's storage right the milk obviously the milk the milk delivery chain has quite a bit of both at the dairy farm at the grocery store in the in the delivery trucks uh in the milk carton you have in your refrigerator and your refrigerator itself right so there's storage systems throughout the whole supply chain it's convenient and it really eliminates that need to produce and deliver milk in real time which i think we all quite appreciate now let's bring it back to the energy sector um even with non-electric types of fuel such as gasoline or natural gas it looks a lot more like milk than it does electricity right you have storage tanks and storage capabilities throughout the entire you know whether you know when you pump your gas at a gas station you're pumping from a storage tank under the ground right there at the gas station and you're putting it into your own storage tank in your vehicle until you actually need it now i'm similar with the natural gas system the lines up and down your street underneath the underneath the street have stored gas in them until the moment you need it so again just bringing back this it's quite a bit different right um we don't have stored electricity as an unused fuel ready at the moment you need it we actually generate it at the moment you need it so it's quite a bit different and this kind of is uh putting it all together in some i think a pretty stark visual so this is information gathered mostly from uscia i believe showing the amount of storage across the energy so there's several weeks of end-use fuel stored in the gasoline and natural gas systems whereas there's less than a tenth of a day stored in the electric system so obviously this is beginning to change but as you can see it's really just barely scratching the surface compared to what we have in these other systems and why does this matter right it really allows us to optimize uh the production and delivery of the end-use fuel in a way that we don't do with the electric all right so let's bring all this together and think about how uh you know how then to utilities deal with this in terms of how they're actually building deploying projects and delivering that across the power system right so an important concept here is energy and capacity all right so we have to be thinking about both of these key concepts as we're thinking about the utilities actually delivering power to from the resources so you know just showing the visual here from kaiso because they have the data readily available but you know this is what we're looking at with capacity in need it's really dealing with peaks whether it's during the day during the month during a year it's really do you have enough throughput to hit these peaks of demand energy on the other hand is really a volumetric metric how much how much energy is being consumed over some some period of time here i'm showing today but then also uh flexibility is an increasing uh increasingly important metric that we think about excuse me this is mercy grail um i think it might be helpful and i don't know that if you would tell folks what uh kaiso is queso is just the grid operator in um so they they serve about 80 percent of the load in the state and they manage a transmission system and real-time energy markets for the state of california so you know tens of millions of customers they have a good uh online interface that allows all this data to be easily easily pooled for presentations like this so again it'd be nice to have this data for the oregon in the northwest but uh perhaps one day thank you but yeah sure and feel free at any other point to stop me and ask questions but so flexibility is another sort of important concept that's increasingly uh relevant to the sector so what is that really about it's about uh the operational capabilities of the actual generators themselves right so you might have the throughput peak capacity capability and you've got the energy available but how quickly can you actually move those generators up and uh physically right so there's operational characteristics of all the generators so that's sort of what this is showing here it's about how quickly can you ramp up and down and this is um actually not the real driver the flexibility need that's emerging it's really this one um so what i'm showing here now is that same blue curve as before and then beneath it is a purple curve which they call the net demand curve so this is really um what everything on the system is doing other than renewables right so renewables are zero marginal cost when they're when they're available and they're generating uh they're essentially free to put on the system so they export everything they can and so you're really looking at is how flexible is the rest of the system the hydra units the natural gas and nuclear plants to be able to uh adjust their output to accommodate that flow of renewables onto the system so here's an even more extreme case of that this is from a spring day in california where it's mild temperatures a lot of sunshine so you can really see that that curve there that steep afternoon curve where they're needing 15 000 megawatts to show up in a three-hour time span so if you think about that you really you need generators to 5000 megawatts an hour to be going from you know to be ramping up so it's quite an operational need and you may have heard this referred to as the duck curve that's colloquia colloquially how how it's uh how it's termed in california i guess i see a so adam cindy condon um here and i just want to make sure my understanding is correct so the difference between the two lines is that renewable essentially yes yes that that's right okay and again this is a california example where it's all more extreme but it helps make the point uh right of sort of this reality is is uh starting to show up here as well certainly it's not quite to this level yet but it's um it's an increasing concern and uh frankly because of the size of the california market uh the realities they have are starting to impact us through the markets so it's impacting energy prices and that sort of thing so and and i'm sorry just to clarify i should have said wind and solar yes yeah okay all right that's right thank and so here i'll give you another kind of uh slice of what this is really really showing us um so this is you know solar power again california comes up in the middle of the day obviously right sun comes up sun goes down and so we're really talking about here is what everything else is doing right so you can really see it here the natural gas plants the imports in this case probably a lot of that's imports from the northwest uh and they're hydro in california it's all sinking in the middle of the day as that solar comes on right so let's go through a little bit of how this all now kind of ties together with how do utilities now take all this information and how does this actually look you know at a course level how does this look when they actually are dispatching power plants so here i'll bring back bring back this curve and we'll isolate just",

        "text": " you go through your inverter did they the uh disadvantages of says maybe a low density and you've got a very strong powerful magnetic field uh you can't have any steel around it uh if you have for example the foundations of the site i saw the kind of the concrete foundations have a fiberglass rebar if you put steel rebar in there or the the magnetic field is so strong it'll pull the rebar out of the concrete but it's cryogenic it's a very a low temperature uh technology you have to uh i think that conducts super conducting con materials has improved since the 1980s so you might be a lower uh temperature a higher temperature superconductor material might work out but i would definitely do a a cost benefit study on that definitely find out whether you have the technology to uh transmission uh power through a submarine cable uh if you can't do it or it's not very cost prohibitive you're gonna have to look at storage and methods of storage and then maybe getting it sent to the shoreline if you do have uh technology for a submarine cable you can put some storage on land uh like either hydrogen or like a fuel cell type thing or a silver gun magnet store smees uh the other i know there's other compressed air maybe but anyway those are some ideas uh just throw them out but i think you'll need to do some cost-benefit space to see if they're even feasible thank you thanks harvey yeah no i agree and there's there's so many different ways to skin this cat which is why you didn't get too much in the weeds of the actual development of the offshore wind or the undersea cabling so that's really going to come down to the finding out what what's the most the most cost-effective method of deployment so that's that's why from our side we just look at the grid and try to simplify and treat these generators as just fixed profiles that are injected at these sites on land ask your question about or your comment about storage we the storage that we did study we co-located at the same substations so they're essentially um at the same of injection and yeah i am curious to see if the how the economics pencil out with the undersea cabling i do know that um the lcv numbers that patrick mentioned did include some at least some undersea transmission so i don't it might not be exactly to these substations but it's it that it's included in that cost there so of course you that it's not going to help if there's no undersea transmission just during winter turbines out there i know other people are looking into floating storage or hide or even hydrogen to absorb some of that power um my opinion of that and i don't know if we want to talk too much about hydrogen but um that's it's essentially just another energy product that still needs to be transported to a load center whether it's electricity or demand or if it's hydrogen demand so it still has to get over the coastal range and there still would need to be investments so it might help a little bit in in shifting when that the offshore one power is used to make it to reduce some curtailment but then in that case it's just another form of storage and there's nothing technology specific in the way that we modeled storage in our production cost modeling so it very easily could be hydrogen storage rather than battery storage um just depends on on how the economics work out thanks marty there's another um uh question in here for you well let me just uh say that there was a comment from mike about um um interacting in the future on windport's navigation studies uh breakwater segments mooring um sounds like he's involved in some east coast wind projects um adam helped answer a good question from amy about the power grid needing to support our regional interconnected system uh yeah actually i saw amy's and i wanted to just briefly uh respond to uh she mentioned how uh oh wait oh sorry adam responding to amy here i guess sorry this repulsion involves this uh topic uh the coastal power loads are relatively small that's true so there'll be times when offshoring is generating significantly more power at a given moment yeah that's true and that's why we we see such a need for expanding those coastal lines uh but we did do a relatively quick analysis on how much of the how much of the coastal load can be served by offshore wind and because a lot of a lot of the benefit here and i imagine people living in these coastal uh support afterwards much more if there is a local benefit rather than just a benefit to the rest of the western connection or even to another state like california like oh it's great that we're we can help the duck curve but what about coastal oregon and we found that based on the timing of coastal loads and the wind speed profiles that offshore wind could serve over 84 of hourly coastal organ loads so it represents a relatively high capacity credit resource for the oregon coastal community so if there was say some outages along those tie-in lines that connect coastal oregon to the rest of the western interconnection offshore wind could could still provide a significant amount of their energy now of course it's not 100 capacity credit but we found between and this is a wide range for a couple of reasons but between 34 and 62 capacity credits that means that um about 33 to 62 percent of the total nameplate capacity of the offshore wind could be can be reliably counted upon to serve load to serve coastal oregon load so we did find a pretty significant benefit to coastal communities and potentially even some reliability and resilience benefits to coastal oregon but we can't we didn't want to say those explicitly without running a reliability model i know it's a it's a really juicy word and it reliability and it's a very important topic but i don't want to over overstate how much the production cost model can say about reliability so hey marty there's a few uh questions coming in here that are actually going to be addressed in jason's slide so i might hold some of these questions if you're able to stay on for a bit longer until after jason slides but there is one for amanda that sounds pretty specific to your findings about um commenting on how your findings might change considering the more realistic scenario under the current bone call area a process that power would be injected into just the fairview and winston substations um she said it might be speculation but it would be helpful to hear your insights yeah certainly would be some speculation if you look at these southern sites so the existing lions the existing topology actually helps it's good that we're looking at the southern areas because the fairview to the ipad corridor line is actually that has the highest capacity right now it's over it's two lines that sum over a thousand megawatts of capacity already and then you can see went into toledo are actually connected in a loop there so if we were only injecting power to winston it would have two paths to get the i5 quarter and so that's really helpful for an n minus one contingency situation and also just for more total uh transmission capacity to get to the i think it actually it probably wouldn't look all that different in terms of individual curtailment at individual sites um with the exception that we could essentially combine to liu and winston at the toledo location so in this case it would be combining central number three and then south central number four into that one call area that that exists now one thing i really can't speculate on is how the power profiles would be when we're looking at slightly different areas i know that you know they're all they're not that far apart from each other but but um local differences in weather will change the timing of the resource which will have a huge impact on its value to the grid so that's really the main and that's something that that travis was getting at right the complementarity of resources sort of the key piece here when we look at grid integration and that will change a bit if we change the the distribution of the turbines so i can't speculate on that too much but i will say that because there isn't really a coastal backbone right now and each of these substations just has a single connection point to the broader grid with the exception of toledo and winston but you can see all the other ones only have a single high voltage connection then they're actually relatively independent in how how their and what happens with their curtailment and their operations so so that's why i think it's our study is still a relatively good approximation of what what will actually happen in the call areas but of course we need to do that study to say for sure i'll just note that there's um a good question from mike about transmission that i'll um we'll go through the transmission slides after this and we'll get to see if there's any more from that question and also note that there's some um conversation in the chat about desalinization needs and hydrogen which could be further uses of um electricity from floating offshore wind okay i'm going to turn it to jason and thanks um marty for staying on the line for a bit longer if more questions come yeah of course thank you all right uh thanks marty switching gears a little bit to you know what what we've talked about a few times in relation to the pnnl study and the nrel study is the need for additional transmission analysis so don't remember the exact phrasing of the comments we heard earlier today but the need for reliability analysis and power flow modeling to really see how the system reacts and whether there is transmission service rights i don't know if that's been mentioned yet today but you need to have transmission service rights as well which is kind of an accounting method for keeping track of where the power is being sold and allocated to which has a little bit different function to it um than like the physical limitations and where electricity actually flows but they're they're kind of related um so kind of with that in mind um i'll talk a little bit about northern they're the regional transmission planning entity for for the pacific northwest region as well as the inter-mountain region they basically perform analysis that examines interactions between all the local transmission plans of the region's transmission providers which there are are many some of them are listed here um bpa pacific or pg idaho power puget sound vista some of those have a lot more transmission mileage",

        "text": " proposed order it's also on the website so you can begin reviewing the proposed order at any time recognizing again so we're not going to be looking at all of that but she'll be presenting that and then you know asking you if you agree with everything you know that in those standards or if you have any material changes that you would like to make and so we'll make note of that it won't be a vote but it'll just be really a straw poll in terms of the next steps we're waiting to see the number of exceptions that are filed it's really impossible to determine how many meetings how much time until we know there's a lot of standard or a lot of issues um so we're going to wait to see how many exceptions are filed and then the responses to those exceptions and then we'll begin reaching out to council members so we we will need to be outside of the regular council meetings probably to be able to deal with this in some reasonable shorter fashion um but again until we know what that universe of exceptions are we won't know sort of what the time hours look like and how many actual days so july is set we know what that is we don't need to know the exceptions for that but beyond that we'll be reaching out to council members to you know with some series of potential dates to try to schedule those um so you know and really what it is is jesse will then will provide an overview of all of the issues in the contest case as well as the exceptions and responses to exceptions and then kellen will kind of follow up on any of those issues related to those standards that aren't part of the contested case um that you know so fish and wildlife you know there are exceptions or issues in the contessa case but not everything around fish and wildlife is in a contested case so jesse will handle the contested case portion kellen will then handle the non-contested case portion so again that could take a day that could take two days we don't know at this point following that we'll have an exceptions and material change hearing meaning any of the limited parties have an opportunity to provide oral comment to counsel again we have to figure out is that one day is that two days um and then then that will be finally followed up with the council's evaluation deliberation uh and and final decision you know three four meetings maybe is sort of what we're looking at right now but we really have to sort of look at all of the information that we have and then try to play that out into some kind of schedule and time frame do we have any time thresholds that we have to meet as a part of those four or five meetings um i mean not really so i mean there's nothing driving it other than you know it we really don't want to wait like on every regular council meeting because then that'll put it out you know another four or five months so um but again it's summer you know we have to look for councils availability so there's sort of a lot of moving parts to put together to make sure that this happens you know in a as efficient time frame as we can best for us to kind of wait till mr ratcliffe kind of focuses in on what the issues are that we need to be focusing on or is it best to start getting familiar with the 348-page document from the hearings official my recommendation is beginning getting comfortable with the document already i mean he's going to go through all of those issues regardless of whether there's exceptions to them he will go through all of those issues that were part of the contested case so um i don't know that you need to read every single word of that document but i think kind of going through it seeing what the issues are understanding the conclusions that the hearing officer has made on all of the issues i think will be helpful and then similarly you know you can look at the proposed contested case order see what the standards are you know kind of implicated in that then i think you can also go and start looking at the proposed order in preparation for july but just those standards that are not part of the contested case so you don't need to review the entire proposed order just the standards um not associated and we'll we'll tee that up actually we should probably send an email which clarifies which of those standards are so you don't have to be guessing and connecting the dots rc i can't i'll just remind you that you have to chair um and and just just a reminder to council members um as well so because the staff the department um we are a party to the contested case uh i mean this is entirely appropriate because we're talking about where to find the information how to navigate it we cannot answer any questions about anything specific in in the contested case in in the proposed order unrelated to the contested case you know we can have those conversations but anything in the contested case uh jesse ratcliffe is your counsel on that and uh it would be most appropriate to contact him directly unless there's any more questions on that i just have one last nancy i hate to do this to you but i am going to want this in hard copy just just so that you have time uh and then my last item is the next council meeting is july 21st and 22nd we don't believe we need two days but um we'll have to look at the agenda again because the carbon um got pushed off to july we also have the two other rulemakings you know we have kellen giving the presentation on the portman hemingway proposed order so we definitely will need friday the 22nd but we'll again look a little more closely and make sure we don't need the thursday as well so just wanted to verify that all council members are available or if not please let us know so we can make sure that we at least have a quorum marcy do we have a location for this meeting we are anticipating um here in salem again but we we needed to run the agenda and the location by umadam chair great okay uh council member choctoo are you available on uh july 22nd and then possibly on july 21st as well i believe so okay i have to check my calendar get back to you okay thank you it sounds like we do have a quorum uh with that uh that concludes my secretary report unless there are any any questions for todd thank you thank you our next agenda item is the stateline win project proposed order on request for amendment 7 of the site certificate this is an action item we have chase mcbae walker senior sighting analyst to present to us chase the floor is yours thank you very much all right i'm not gonna touch that as much as i want to good morning chair grail vice chair hal members of the council for the record my name is chase mcvay walker a senior signing analyst with oregon department of energy's sighting division my presentation this morning is on agenda item e and it's your review of the proposed order on request for amendment 7 to the state line win project site certificate for this presentation today i will provide council with a facility overview including a description of the approved facility location and site certificate history then i'll discuss the procedural history on request for amendment 7. following the procedural history i'll move into describing and discussing the changes that were incorporated between the draft proposed order and proposed order which were an administrative purely administrative and i'll conclude the presentation today by turning it over to council for a final deliberation and decision the stateline wind project consists of two operational units with a combined peak generating capacity of 222 state line 1 and 2 is composed of 186 wind turbines and has a peak generating capacity of up to 123 megawatts advancicle 2 consists of 43 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 99 megawatts there are two certificate holders with the stateline wind project site based on these two geographic units of the facility state line one and two is one of the units and basically two is the other the certificate holder for state line one and two is fpl energy fan sickle llc or state line sorry yeah yeah energy band sickle llc and the certificate holder for vancicle 2 is fdl energy state line 2 incorporated both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of nextera energy resources related or supporting facilities to the van sickle or to the state line wind project include a power collection met towers operation and maintenance buildings a substation and an interconnection transmission line as well as permanent access roads i know this map i'm gonna actually get up and adjust the okay um on this slide i can see a figure a map of the facility and the facility itself is located in umatilla county north and east of helix oregon the towns closest to the facility are helix oregon and touche washington the council issued a site certificate for the stateline win project on september 14 2001 and has subsequently amended the site certificate six times with the most recent amendment approved by council in january of this year 2022 and just a recap on amendment 6 which was approved by council in january uh the sixth amended site certificate included a repowering of the existing 43 vancicle ii wind turbines and that repowering would include replacing the blades and the cells and would result in an increase in the maximum blade tip height and would reduce the minimum ground and it reduced the minimum ground clearance well and lastly it increased the repowering would increase the generating capacity per turbine amendment 6 also included a proposal to construct 50 megawatts of battery power request for amendment 7 much like request for amendment 6 is specific to the vancicle 2 geographic unit and therefore was submitted by fpl fpl energy band sickle fpl energy state line two uh and request for amendment seven the certificate holder uh in request for amendment seven seeks approval from to amend the approved turbine specifically the minimum above ground blade tip height and the hub height repowered wind turbines if repowered the proposed wind turbine specification would um the proposed wind turbine specification changes would result in a decrease in the minimum above ground blade tip height from what was approved in january which was 59 feet down to 50 feet and would increase in hub height 295 feet to 315",

        "text": " point so we would expect and we're already starting the process of detailed on the ground studies uh to determine what the impacts might be what the areas might be that need to be avoided if we can uh and so when we say it's designed we're not anywhere near final design we still need to take all that input and feedback and understand if there are areas that you know would require a change in route uh in order to uh avoid that kind of impact do of course believe that there's an advantage to this and that it has no visual impact and it takes away the kinds of risks that are often associated with transmission like wildfire risks severe climate that kind of thing so it it supports resiliency of the system in terms of potential benefits this is a major construction project we think that there's 300 to 400 jobs uh all told at Peak during the construction process the estimated cost at this point is about 1.5 billion maybe in today's um and we are pursuing a federal department of energy grant that would help alleviate that cost but we are not asking for any state Grant State money state subsidy uh and in fact we think that the facilities could be a major contributor to the local tax basis uh next I want to emphasize that we're well aware of the extent of the scrutiny and the environmental reviews that are going to take place at the state and the federal we also as I said before want to be respectful and responsive to concerns of the tribal Nations uh we do believe and are convinced that this can be done in a low impact way both during construction and during operation and this is based on any of a number of these types of facilities that have been installed around the world including our own where we have not had uh experience uh any sort of adverse experience in terms of environmental impact uh I should mention that uh uh because this question often comes up you know is there an electromagnetic field impact uh we can point you and we would encourage you to read a number of studies that have been done on this issue specifically as it relates to marine life uh so you know we we want to be clear about wanting to help you the public understand this project and address the concerns in the in those a point about the river installation um the agencies one way to help protect marine life is to impose what's called work windows so that you can only install the cable uh during particular times of the year away from migration away from spawning and away from uh when most of the recreational use of the river takes and we fully expect and have experienced uh in our own way work windows and can can comply with thanks please as I said expecting a lot of attention and agency review and public review of this project we will be working with the U.S Army Corps of Engineers both from an environmental perspective and a navigational perspective this project will be fully reviewed under NEPA uh there will be as part of that process section 106 consultation with tribal Nations government to government we will be working with the Washington f-sec it's a slightly different acronym as well as the Oregon have said as well as approvals that might be required from the municipalities and the counties we also need interconnection agreements with both the Bonneville power Administration and Portland General Electric and this event tonight really is the kickoff of our permitting process uh actually it started with the submission of the notice of intent and now the public meetings just go quickly to the next slide there we go this is just a listing of similar Marine transmission lines that have been built in various places as you can see a few of them have been done in the U.S of the four that exist in the our company has been responsible for two of them they range as you can see in in terms of length uh between 453 miles and seven miles so the technology Works regardless of the length of the uh of the line thanks and just to talk briefly about our own experience uh we have two the Neptune Project runs from New Jersey to Long Island it now supplies about 25 percent of all the electric energy used on Long Island and has for 16 years we're coming up to 16 years The Hudson Project uh similarly in this case it runs down the Hudson River and interconnects to a major substation right in downtown again it's been um they've both been running well with no environmental issues you've probably met some of these people a lot of them are here tonight but we are supported by a team of experienced people that uh hopefully can answer questions probably better than I can if you have any and finally next we do we've been doing this kind of project for a while and we know that the only way that they get built and built is to engage openly and respectfully and to meet all permitting and regulatory requirements to not cut uh to try to be responsive to questions and inquiries even if they're difficult and to try to partner with residents and communities not only to address their uh but also to help Advance compatible interests of the environment social economic and we intend to do that so with that that concludes the presentation thank you great uh we're gonna start the question and answer section in just a section a second but Nancy could you put my slideshow back up for one second I guess while we're waiting can I get a quick show of hands of how many people are interested in asking a question or providing comment okay great um yes so uh if you uh those of you that do want to provide comment can make your way down to the microphone at the front here um I just wanted to share that the department does have a number of helpful resources um on our website and the link is provided at the bottom there for those of you in the room we also have some handouts that have all the different helpful links on them so you can go ahead and grab one of those and take it um and hopefully at least find the project page and the fsec page which can take you to many of these resources um also from this page you can reach our new citing comment portal which will allow you to um post post a comment and have that posted directly to our website um we also have our public ID siding which there is a copy on the table up front and numbers of handouts about deciding standards themselves in addition to this if you want to sign up to get email notices about this project you can find a link from that page as well or you can speak to one of us at this meeting and we can help you get signed up on our display out front okay and then um if you could advance to the next thank you and actually just go one go one ahead one more okay um so like I said we'll have people in the room that want to provide a comment just come down to the microphone here at the front now um and then we can take comments from folks online uh if you are on the webinar and you want to provide a um please press the hand icon on the lower right hand side of your window you may have to click the button that says participants first and then that little hand icon will pop up if you're on the you can press star three and that will uh raise your hand and then once you're done providing your comment please just press star three again okay and then yep please go ahead and if you don't mind stating your name for the record oh sure okay uh my name is Greg Parson I live right here in The Dalles and uh I'm a retired ibw 48 member electrician and uh retired from Bonneville power Administration so this was kind of my jurisdiction here Big Eddy substation slyler converter station and numerous uh substations around here but my question is mainly right now I'm advocating with the Columbia Gorge Community College and with the youth seniors mainly right now talking about apprenticeship and training so along that line consideration would be for apprentices and local area potential jobs for young people you know within the our jurisdiction here so um that's my train of thought there fine very good yes we're we're intending absolutely and specifically to work with for instance the Community College here uh and others uh to encourage that kind of thing apprenticeships and training and it's not just for us but for the future because having that technological ability is going to translate to the renewable energy that's going to be built east of here and when I talk about east of here uh it's not just Oregon and Washington uh there's a lot of solar and wind that is being built in further eastern states Wyoming Nevada that uh can be as I'm sure you know transmitted to the big Eddie connection point so what we're proposing is basically a Last Mile uh to get over the Cascades and into the load centers uh uh on the west and I should mention here too that the benefit of the project is going to go beyond just Oregon because the Western location uh gets us to the uh I-5 corridor and so it will uh help the power flow not just East-West but also to some extent north south so that's another reason why it's kind of a Bi-State project not just physically but in terms of the potential benefit of meeting both States renewable uh mandates thank you and just one more maybe a comment not so much a question but I see this uh has a good opening where tying the grids across the United States DC would be an advocate for everybody to kind of share and balance that power load based on demand and hey if there happens to be storms in certain areas and part of the grid goes down or generation that you know this gives us another Avenue it's it's just kind of like our interstate system or our rail systems you know it's uh it's about the most efficient way to go is DC over any amount of distance I know that from working it so thank you uh thanks so much for your comment um is there anyone else in the room that has a question or would like to provide a thanks so much thank you uh I'm Wood Anderson and I represent the city of Mosier I got lots of questions but maybe a couple Chris uh Cascade Chris I forget you lasted um you you mentioned your slide said The Dalles Stevenson and Portland I think are the municipalities affected we got the notice here in Moses and as Moser has a bunch of water that or land that's under the Bonneville pool so do you I guess my question goes to your desktop studies to date on don't have the alignment uh actually known yet I",

couple times and have some lessons learned that could be scalable to the region or even Statewide I guess what I hope you'll take away here is that we don't want to limit the information we get by being specific about what could be helpful if you think you we should hear about something or if you are excited about something your energy or energy related then let us know so my picture of the best case scenario here is that our inbox is flooded with information whether it's a story about how your ant lost power and couldn't get gas for the generator or a County Risk mitigation plan or strategies that an agricultural industry group are trying in order to keep red Dy diesel in the equipment we'll then read through everything and um throw all the data into buckets and look for patterns then the report will describe what we found and what might be helpful since we intend this to be living document will look back in the future and see what worked what ended up not being a big deal and what we missed the first time around now if there's specific information that you think we should know but you don't want it to be public let us know and we'll make sure that we respect your security concerns to the best of our ability I will note here that the I Aja did include uh a clause that makes the energy security plans exempt from the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act in general at Odo we tend to lean on the side of transparency and openness but we respect any request that data not be shared and we'll work with you to ensure that we are all on the same page about what that means to you now comes the fun part while it's still fresh in your mind anything you said ah I got this great idea I got this great stuff they can use send it here um we've got the uh email link that was shared um we've got a a QR code that you can get to our website and then go to the comment portal um for entry texts like your energy and security stories um if you have a document that needs to get sent send it to the email address as an attachment um and uh that's probably your best bet uh please try to add a little bit about yourself in the email so we know who you are what industry you're with and what region of the state you're in um our our our um Contracting friends at CNA in the next little bit will talk about what those regions of the state are so uh stay tuned so the best time to S send in stuff is right now because it's fresh in your head um if there's something you need uh to take some time to get together that's fine too uh we'd like to have the data together by sort of mid uh mid December uh if there's some stragglers a little later that's fine too but the longer it takes the more likely it'll be saved for the 2025 update rather than the inaugural 2024 plan so there's the homework and how to turn it in we've done a lot of talking so far and we've given on you a lot to process so we're going to take a 10-minute break um feel free to get your homework done in class if you're so inclined um and after the break we'll be talking about the plan for the meetings to plan the okay we'll be back at all right everybody welcome back from the break we are going to move on to our next section U which we're going to be introducing our strategy for stakeholder engagement and facilitation and to start I'll introduce myself I'm Dr Casey stemman I'm a research analyst with CNA and we've been contracted to lead all the engagement activities on this project and I will be leading the planning and the execution of stakeholder engagement and facilitation and we do have a wider team supporting this project but there are two other folks in particular that I want you to be familiar with one is Andrew eworth he's a senior research specialist with CNA and he'll be supporting all of the engagement activities as well as stakeholder Outreach and data analysis and visualization another name is Heather Marshall she's a senior research specialist as well she'll also be supporting all of these activities and specifically focusing on Outreach and followup so I want you to be familiar with all three of our names because you may be hearing from us through email and phone calls as we work to engage with you guys throughout the process now the key thing that we want to be very clear in communicating is that we see you as absolutely vital for the success of the development and the imple implementation of the energy security plan and so our goals are really to capture the diversity of views and priorities across the state of Oregon so that they can inform this plan and so as we pursue these goals we're going to be abiding by three principles one is promoting openness another is encouraging the diverse view viewpoints and the third is fostering Mutual trust throughout the life of the project and we've been abiding by these principles from this very first meeting and in the the effort of of promoting openness and and incorporating diverse viewpoints I want to walk you through our strategy which starts with a focus on the spatial distribution of all of the representatives that will inform this plan and so the map on the left shows you the state of Oregon divided into six different regions they're colorcoded and you can see identify which county you're associated with and then see which region you would fall into and then the map on the left shows us the distribution of the different tribal Nations um this map shows us the locations of their headquarters and so we want to ensure that we have adquate representation across all of these regions and so what we identified are a total of 461 individuals that we see can provide Vital Information to the development of this plan and the map on the left shows us the distribution within the state of Oregon and so each of the little circles represent a different county in the state and they're colorcoded by the region in which that County Falls and then the size of the circle indicates how many representatives are located in that county and you can see we have a good distribution of folks throughout the state of Oregon across all of their the regions and we have a higher number of representatives from the cities of Portland and Salem and that's really to be expected because of the concentration of government offices in those cities now we also have folks that have been invited that are outside of the state of Oregon and so you can see the distribution in the map on the right again Oregon we have the highest concentration there with the big yellow circle but we have other folks for example from the federal government that would be located in DC or we have folks that represent multiple states such is the Western um States petroleum collaboration and so they represent a number of Western States Oregon being one of those and so we know the spatial distribution of you guys but there are other characteristics that we want to take into consideration and so the gauge on the leand side shows us the percentage of folks that we know have interest in environmental justice issues so we currently have identifi 24% and then the figure in the middle shows that we have the great majority of folks associated with government entities so we have 277 folks from the government then we also have a good portion of folks from nonprofit associate entities or associations organizations we have consumer owned utilities private sector Representatives folks from Academia tribal Nations Etc and then the figure on the right shows the areas of specialty and the primary interests for each of the different um Representatives that we've have invited and we gathered this information either through perhaps personal relationships that Odo has with you guys and so they could tell us firsthand what they know each of you specialize in and then we also gleaned information from websites for example that um are associated with the organizations that you represent and so this is open data that we have just organized into this figure and so what you can see is the great majority of folks are interested in impacts and collaborative efforts at the state level and that's followed by threats and mitigation and interdependencies whether that's within the energy sector or cross sector we have local level impacts environmental justice emergency response plans energy storage and so on now we also have some interests that are represented but a at a much lower level so if you scroll down to the bottom of this figure you can see that we've invited folks that do have um Specialties in areas such as waste supply chain issues Communications cyber Etc now as I mentioned this is information that we gleaned through our research but you all know what your interests and your areas of Specialties are much better than we do and so that survey that I highlighted that we're going to be giving you guys at the end of this meeting in that survey you'll have an opportunity to share with us what your primary interests in are is a specialty are so please do provide that to us so we can validate what we've already found and then expand on it so that it is so that it is as accurate as possible so we know a little bit about what you you guys look like as a group and now what we want to do is show how we're going to um solicit feedback from you guys and have you as involved as possible into development of this plan and this is going to happen through a series of meetings and what I'm presenting here is our ideal scenario so this is our starting point of a schedule to give you a big overview of the different activities and the order in which will they will occur what I want to be very clear about is that we expect this to change we know that people's schedules change we know that priorities change through time and so again this is our starting point and we'll work to adhere to it as much as we can knowing that things will change through time and so we're starting off today with our kickoff we're in the month of October and as Tom already teed up we're going to be asking for information from you guys regarding energy data sources resilience plans other types of input including energy insecurity stories which we'll be touching on next following the kickoff we're going to focus on meetings that work to solicit feedback for each region throughout the state and we're going to um be addressing gaps in the data so we'll be doing data Gap data Gap assessments and then we also want input",

        "text": " the department will issue a draft final order with a notice of appearing to adopt the final order um and we kind of that's the formal name for it but we kind of just call it a material change hearing because at that point in time it is an opportunity to see if anything really had materially changed from the proposed order to that draft final order and then at that so we'll have that hearing and then counsel um unless there's a different direction um can uh to have basically make their final decision on the project and exact dates todd kind of went over some of those exact dates and locations we're working on it but we're kind of getting an idea getting closer to that so um yeah let's take off the jacket okay thank you um so this is a uh council is probably pretty used to seeing our little um chevron diagram of our um process here um i also have a table on my tables on my next slide that have dates associated with these major milestones it also has little sub milestones that have um come out of this i have the arrows at those three because that's what this kind of bundling of this meeting and the next meeting and then that the the material change hearing these are all kind of they're a little bit blended so these are kind of um even though they're they on a timeline separately right we issued the proposed order there was a contested case on the proposed order and ultimately council will make a final decision council just now is reviewing everything that has happened you know like council hasn't seen this in a while um and then there's also things in here that aren't reflected like the um the proposed contested case order which was the outcome of the contested case so this is kind of this is the the date version of it um i don't need to go back in time very very far but um for those who have been checking or even looking at this this this project has been around for a while now um even though the notice of intent was in 2010 which was the very beginning there have been some um kind of natural pauses that were brought from the applicant idaho power because we kind of started the state process council's process with the federal process and then ultimately the the applicant ended up kind of pausing the council's review to get further through the federal process because the route outcomes of that would kind of the routes that they would select to include in their application precise certificate so that's kind of where there's that that time lag let's move up to september 2018 this is when we deemed the application complete and when we deem an application complete particularly this is like before um pandemic we we have in person um information meetings and so we went to all five counties which are you know malcare baker union um uh umatilla and morrow county we had information meetings in each one and then from that complete application the department wrote its draft proposed order or dpo and we issued that in may of 2019. now the draft proposed order and we really like clarifying the folks is that this is a draft of staff recommendations this is our cut and this is like and you know and that's why we put it out um for comment for the public um for reviewing agencies um that won't even for the applicant like did we get it right is there something we missed is there that's why it goes out and so it went for an extended comment period and then um under statute statute allots the opportunity for an applicant to request to respond to comments received so kind of towards the end of that comment period there were a lot of comments and so idaho power requested uh maybe at the hearing officer or of council anyway um that to extend the comment period because that functionally leaves the record open so they could respond to issues raised um because it's a a draft document that we want to have have it reflect any um information gaps or issues raised so their their comment uh deadline which basically got closed the record so the record is now closed so this is important because the department has sent counsel um the proposed order with your staff reports and as you're reading it you're reading the proposed burden you're seeing that there's red lines right there's red line edits and there's some footnotes function of the proposed order is uh the department's response to comments by the public agencies and also information added to the record board the applicant's responses so the red lines reflect modifications driven from that comment period and issues raised and information added to the record by the applicant that is what is reflected in those red lines in that proposed order so once we issue that proposed order we also issue a notice of the contested case and it says hey um we've issued this proposed order check out those red lines if you're satisfied that's great um if you're not satisfied with the response you can request you can submit a petition to participate in the contested case proceeding and there's criteria um that uh the petitioners have to demonstrate in their petitions to get into the contested case um and i think what we can talk about that more it may come up in the exceptions but um over the last couple years um b2h related contested case related agenda items have come in front of council so for instance council did have a series of council meetings or a couple days of meetings that they reviewed the petitions for for party status or appeals of the hearing orders hearing officers order on party status there's been various times that um questions have been raised or items have been in front of council so it has been kind of presented and remind when presented to counsel that and the hearing officer throughout the contested case did um provide updates to council about the so the um the close of the contested case resulted in this proposed contested case order issued by a hearing officer we'll call it a pcco because we love acronyms and then limited parties and parties can file exceptions to that and then there is 15 days to response to exceptions um links to that have been provided to council and we'll do that again and which leads us here today we're in red um we're going over the standards not related to the fantastic case so um of the proposed order so you know functionally in the final order um so today like the example that i gave if under one of the standards that we're going through today you want to see some changes and have a basis for that change and we do some we're going to be making like additional red lines to that already redlined proposed order and the idea is that when when council is ready or what we're going to do we issue that draft final order we're going to go in and we're going to accept all those changes so now red lines go away and that becomes your you know draft final document all these are steps to getting to what the final order would look like all right so by the way what do i actually say uh but i hope that that helps kind of helps put context to this is where we're at oh my gosh um so okay so we have the proposed facility and people are aware that it is predominantly a transmission line um but there's um other components that build that make up the proposed facility um a proposed energy there is a sx rules have a energy facility and it includes its related and supporting facilities the applicant's proposal for the energy facility is um the the transmission line routes uh a longhorn station substation and the communication so um on this note i know this isn't a great map um but this is a map of the overall it's hard to get a great map of all the five counties but i have some additional maps but on this i wanted to note that um council has for other uh facilities um seeing applicants request that the site boundary be considered the microsite and right um and so uh the applicant in this case is doing the same thing they're requesting that the site boundary is the micrositing corridor and the microscience corridor basically means they are going to evaluate all of the resources that could be protected under council standards within that area um and then that gives them the flexibility to move that transmission line anywhere within that area and so as we see with wind energy facilities or other types of facilities um it's often that uh the the microsighting area may be bigger than the actual permanent impact but it just gives flexibility to move these facility components around um so for the 500 kilovolt transmission line the the site boundary slash micro sighting corridor because we're kind of calling those two the same thing is 500 feet 500 feet wide the site um the site boundary for the rest of the features they change depending on what feature we're looking at um but so for the longhorn substation is 190 acres it's not 190 acre substation it's just that it's actually a 20 acre but um and i'll talk about the substation a little bit more later um but it's proposed to go in this area at the port of memorial so what that's saying is like we're saying all of it's here but they're maybe they may move it around in um within that so and then the psychonic for access roads would be either 100 to 200 feet depending on the type of road and where it's located so that is that's our micro siting area or our site boundary that's the area that's surveyed that's what we're looking at but the actual um for this facility the actual final you know footprint permanent impact is going to be the right of way so the right way um most for most areas for the actual transmission line for the 500 kv transmission line is going to be 250 feet right so we have 500 feet and then so it's going to finally be 250 feet which gives you that extra 250 feet to move the the facility around um based on landowner preferences based on avoiding or minimizing impacts to other sensitive resources so that's for the 500 kv now in forested areas that right of way goes out to 300 feet and um i'll talk about this later but this is for safety measures um to maintain vegetative clearance zones for hazard trees and limbs etc so that's why it'd be wider in forested areas there's an area on the naval weapons system trading facility near boardman and that right right-of-way would be 90 feet so that's a narrow one and then there's um we'll get my next slide has some of the alternatives including some rebuilds but some of the proposed alternate routes are um",

        "text": " in the data or unintentional biases of the inputs or the interpretations for example how well does the ER model agree with other tools that are available some of which are just o open source and online thank you so all of the data that is that is going into it will be uh public and um and that that is actually a process that we've we've gone through the the last few weeks of identifying what are the data sets that are specific to Oregon that are going to be um give us the best character characterization for the state so the the data inputs and assumptions will will all be uh transparent and and open at the end of the process here and you'll see in the working groups the the ones that are being used if you have um Alternatives that we should be using then then please bring those up in the in the working group sessions um the the models themselves they are they are proprietary um and the challenge there is that you know it is it is our um IP um but they they also in terms of the open-source models um we include a lot more detail in there um you can see some comparisons for example if you look at our national hydrogen work um that work has been compared against about 12 other models that were also modeling um the impacts of Ira on on hydrogen adoption um and and that highlights the the differences and similarities so there are some comparisons out there of our work with with others um and we can also share a lot of detail about what what are our models actually doing and we have a detailed technical appendices that we can um put the details of into into the chat or share them at a later date that's great thanks chairman we had a question on from Jennifer building new gas is prohibited in Washington how does that factor in relying on Imports mark uh so so building building resources are um they're constrained based on the policies that are set in in different states and so that that does factor into into the modeling if we don't have the availability of resources in particular places the model has to find an alternative for that and so it is representing the the realism of of policy impacts um that that we see state state right thank you Alan you had a hand off yeah back on Eric STD's question so the whole point of the working groups is to actually go through all of that information and and and work through that stuff so that that that we get the inputs into the model correctly and that the work group is informed of that and and and helps formulate the inputs into the model I'll also point out that the what the model does is actually create the what things will occur in in a particular scenario the reference scenario or any of the other ones that we look at and it will and then but it doesn't necessarily get into H how exactly that particular I action gets done or or the very detailed specific a lot of the questions that we're getting here are like two levels down from what the model can do about you know a specific difference between this Transit and this type of of of uh multimodal transportation that the model can't get down to that level but it'll it'll talk about the reduction in vmts and things like that and and also the model once we get the model in place and the scenarios run the whole point of the scenario running is to compare each scenario back to the reference scenario so we can see if we go down this path or we constrain transmission or we cons or we can't get Renewables uh in the pace what you want what what happens to greenhouse gas emissions what happens to energy prices what happens to all all these different factors that will be that are the results that come out of the moling it doesn't give you the answer again but it informs that conversation so that when we get that to that point we'll be able to look at all that data and say okay potentially this is the way we want to go and in order to go that way we will need to uh probably need to think about this policy and this policy and we need to uh create this program and this incentive and we need and we don't know this this and this and we need to research them so that's kind of the end product of of where the where the energy strateg is going to go that's great thank you Al so I'm going to keep just moving through questions I'm going to do a couple in the chat and then I'm going to come to uh Pat so if we can queue up Pat um for When I Call On Call on you so there was a question from forest are future climate forecasts included in any of the energy demand scenarios um so they can be the the uh the underlying data sets that come from from eia do include changes in heating Degree Days and and cooling Degree Days um and so in in terms of of forecasting increased heat uh cooling demand then that is something that that our model would be picking up using that data set um the impact on hydro which I think is a more pertinent question for for Oregon is a a challenging one to um to model the impacts of of climate change on that and and one thing is that we are currently investigating is working with um the power Council and work that they've done to characterize changes in in Hydro capabilities to build that into our model as well yeah thank you Jeremy um from Andrew will you be able to show total cumulative green gas emission differences between scenarios yes so we will be hitting our greenhouse gas Targets in all of our scenarios but depending on the on the types of uncertainty or strategies taken um in the scenarios themselves then we'll be showing different ways of complying with those and so if we if we doing Less in transportation for example because we're moving moving more slowly on electrification then we'd be doing more in other places in the economy and the model would show what are the the consequences and costs of doing that good thank you from Dave another example for modeling will it consider scenarios around penetration of low carbon fuels like renewable diesel or only consider electric or hydrogen levers yes so it's definitely considering clean fuels it's one of the strengths of of the modeling approach where uh in that second step the high level description of our modeling where it's the energy demands from the economy we have a demand for gasoline a demand for diesel demand for jet fuel for heavy fuel oil all of those types of fuels um but when we are building out Supply chains to meet those demands those don't need to be fossil those could be a blend of fossil with biomass derived fuels with hydrogen deriv fuels with existing B fuel supply um or biodiesel and and all of that depends on the costs of building out Supply chains to meet that and so the model will be solving for what are the the the best ways to meet our emissions targets considering um clean fuels as an option there right thank you can we um let's pat pat can you uh ask your question please you got to be unmuted unmute all right great now can you hear me y we got you great um you answered my question on the reference scenario that's not a business as usual but it sounds like it's a optimized uh way of meeting the three targets that you've identified for uh the state's goals and that this the scenarios are then variations of of that with regards to the key assumptions that you mentioned but I'd like to know a little bit more and please correct me if there's anything in that that was wrong but um can you give me some more detail with regards to the level of of I mean the level of detail in the demand sectors for example um what are the various um energy sector demands for buildings and what's the level of detail for example in your transportation Fleet are you looking at specific classes of vehicles or is it somehow some kind of an aggregated demand I'd like to know some more about that level of detail on your on your demand side and I have another question after you answer that if you don't mind so on the transportation side it is the the the EPA use types okay so it is pretty disaggregated by use type um and we can so you have compacts all the way to large SUVs and light truck and heavy trucks yes yeah um and we can apply different assumptions about what types of vehicles people are are buying great in those sectors and then vmts efficiency the cost of those Vehicles the cost of the um vehicle charging infrastructure right all of those are are specified and um and then in on the building side then it is the the the different types of energy service within the building and it's broken up by residential commercial and then uh industry has the the building component of Industry as well um where it would be the uh Heating and Cooling and um and water heating and uh clothes washing clothes drying cooking um the the ventilation chilling in in commercial building uh so it's broken out by those service types demands and then to meet the those Energy Service demands then we have have a whole variety of of technologies that could be installed in those buildings and then when people replace those Technologies there are options for placing those there's about 360 technology options in the model um and uh and the the efficiency of those techn IES is broken up by vintage so if a customer is placing an older system but they're replacing it like for like with a modern reference system then the efficiency of that modern system is much higher because it's compliant with current efficiency standards right um or they and you have the other the additional EPA classes in terms of higher efficiency levels and cost levels so we do include so it is compliant with with current efficiency standards for all the technologies that are in there we include the option to do um high efficiency versions of that so beyond the mandated standards um but we tend to We tend to favor a policy of of replacing with heat pumps if we're talking about heating or cooling rather than the high efficiency like for like just because the costs are pretty high and maybe the footprint is a bit larger so not an easy plug-in like uh install for only a few percentage points difference on the efficiency site so we we tend to favor a a high heat pump adoption strategy in in place of high efficiency like for like if that makes sense when you say you favor that do you I mean often I mean I'm sorry I have a lot of experience with this kind of modeling as well and very often the heat pumps are selected simply because they are the most costeffective Choice when you",

        "text": " and progress them for you if you want to just key me in when you're ready okay great thanks uh next slide please so um during the short time I'm just going to give a brief overview of the climate trust and then an update on the voluntary carbon market and how the or Oregon CO2 standards fits within the voluntary carbon market and then I'll also update on um the status of the Oregon CO2 standard and where the climate trust is at currently uh with spending down the dollars on offsets uh next page please so the climate trust we were actually funded in 1997 under the Oregon CO2 standard um as the qualified organization to um meet the regulatory requirements of the facilities we are one of the oldest carbon offset entities in the country and so back in 1997 and through today we have really pivoted from piloting the market to now being an active um Enga actively engaged in the market as a project developer and not only a finance and um financer and investor in carbon offset project projects our Focus today since we have pivoted to be a project developer is on three voluntary carbon offset sectors those are ifm which is improved Forest management the way that those projects work is we work with land owners um private and public land owners to change their forestry management to increase sequestration we also work on reforestation projects which is has a focus on post Wildfire on tribal lands in the Pacific Northwest and then also on in the Southeast and then the last sector that we're really focusing on today is grassland conservation so that is where we place a conservation easement on grasslands to avoid their conversion to development or cropland we work in both the compliance and the voluntary carbon Market the compliance Market is based in California with a link to Quebec and then the voluntary Market um is robust all throughout the world including the United States to dat uh we have worked on 111 carbon offset projects and we have provided $84 million in carbon financing to these projects next slide please so within the voluntary carbon market and this is where the Oregon CO2 standard fits within there the Registries are the governing body of a carbon Market the Registries this is who certifies the carbon offsets that are then supplied to the Oregon CO2 standard and they are the ones who come up with the protocols to quantify emission reductions from different project types and the rules of the programs these the protocols that they developed are reviewed by Third parties and they do have a public comment process for uh for the rules and updates and within all carbon offset project types no matter the sector there are four rules um that apply to all offsets and those are that offsets must be additional they must prevent leakage they must be permanent and also quantifiable so additionality that means that the emission reductions are above business as usual and without the carbon financing like is supplied from the Oregon CO2 standard the emission reductions would not have occurred uh leakage is when uh emission reductions occur in one area you're ensuring that there's not an an increase in emission reduction in emissions in another area permanent means that the offsets will last forever and there won't be a reversal in some offset sector types there is a risk of reversal and so those projects do take a deduction in the amount of offsets issued from them and lastly the offsets must be quantifiable so there must be high certainty around the carbon cycle of the project to ensure that the emission reductions are real next next slide please so the Registries that were just mentioned there are three main Registries that the Oregon coo2 standard has um received offsets from those those Registries are Vera which is the largest um registry in the world but they also have a United States focused the American carbon registry and the climate action Reserve that is where the majority of offsets come from for the Oregon CO2 standard and then the other large carbon Market is the compliance Market which can supply offsets to the voluntary Market but they are not allowed to supply offsets to the Oregon standard um next slide please I put this slide in here just to show um all the stakeholders that are involved in the Oregon CO2 standard and carbon offset project development the voluntary carbon Market is rapidly growing on the supply and the buy side of offsets and what this has resulted in is more higher quality offsets but it's more competitive to purchase those uh the end result though of this is good um for the market it means that we are achieving more greenhouse gas impact than we have been in the past so the the dollars supplied to a carbon offset project they go to the project owner um which can be a landowner uh easan holder so that would be the um land owner who is encumbering their land through a deed or a facility owner which could be a business a utility or also a dairy um operation owner the other um Market participant would be the project developer that is the climate trust role where we develop the projects and make sure that the projects are following the rules of those Registries that I just and there are the thirdparty verifier so all offsets applied to the Oregon CO2 standard they are thirdparty verified which means an independent auditor make sure that the project developer is following the rules of the protocol and the Registries and then lastly there are the buyers so that is a that can be Fortune 500 companies local utilities breweries um mainly any company the new buyer types that have come into the market over the past couple years are investors where they're seeing carbon as a commodity and buying it to resell in the future at a higher price and then also retail platforms which is where you can list your offsets online and then individuals families small businesses can purchase offsets from projects which is helping them gain access to the market that they didn't have uh in the past uh next slide please so the the Oregon CO2 standard which works within the voluntary Market that is becoming more robust uh there are a few management requirements of the climate trust because we are the qualified organization we must commit um 60% of offset funds within two years of a facilities construction start date and we must spend no more than 20% on management that 20% on management that we use that goes to the Contracting to purchase the offsets uh the paying for the offsets issuance and retirement and then also uh the staff time to go through the process of evaluating the projects that we are going to supply to the program in terms of reporting requirements we must submit a fiveyear report every five years that next report will be in 2024 and we must Supply annual facility status reports M many of the facilities at this point in time have fulfilled 100% of their obligations so we are down to limited reports every year next slide please so the last year um in 2022 the spending summary we obligated and retired $1.9 Million worth of offsets to the program that equaled 146,000 offsets from an arbay forestry project the goal of the program is we will spend the last dollar in 2026 when deploying dollars from the program we look for high quality offsets with a focus in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest to dat the Oregon CO2 dollars have supported 23 Oregon based projects um Oregon as a state and whole has a limited amount of carbon offset projects while it is growing many of them won't be online until after 2026 at the end of 2022 we did identify a Oregon based ifm project that in 2023 we allocated $3 million to to spend on offsets um and that will be in my next update after the audit is finished and how we spent those dollars and in 2022 we received um two t of payments one from PGE cardi and Northwest Natural Miller station and we have hit Our obligation of committing 60% of those funds uh next slide please so this slide is just showing um where we're where we were at at the end of 2022 so you can see in unobligated cash there was um $5.4 million in unobligated that will be spent by the end of 2026 and in 2023 the majority of that was spent um and obligated to the new Oregon for isry project that was that is development and then also you can see that we have have um in that second column met our commitments for many of the programs at this time at uh today so those numbers will be down more when I give the 2023 update um next slide please great I included this slide I wanted to show um just changes in carbon pricing over time the voluntary Market has rapidly grown and so has prices particularly for nature-based climate Solutions it's a little difficult to track uh carbon offset pricing just in the United States alone many reports are based worldwide uh but in the US now we're seeing US Forestry based and nature-based projects in the high teens and another update that has changed in the voluntary carbon Market is offsets are now divided into two classes um they're called removal credits and reduction credits reduction credits are avoidance so you're avoiding an emission from happening and a removal credit is an increase in carbon sequestration so you're taking carbon out of the atmosphere those removal credits are valued even higher than the reduction credits so those ones from the forestry sector are now being traded in $25 or more at this time the main drivers of carbon pricing are project types and the co- benefits of the projects but also location and that is why we see a lot of demand for projects in the Pacific Northwest and California because there are so many large tech companies and other companies based out of those areas who want to supply carbon dollars to local projects next slide please and the other big change um the past two years in the voluntary carbon Market is there are a lot more standards being developed so these are overreaching standards they're the Integrity Council for voluntary carbon markets the task force on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the voluntary carbon Market Integrity initiative and what these organizations are doing is they are coming up with standards that those Registries the governing bodies are all supposed to review and adopt and the hope is that it increases transparency for buyers or end users like the facilities so when you receive an offset from American carbon registry or climate action Reserve you know that both of those offsets are following the same set standards of rules next slide please and just wanted to put up here the",

        "text": " just if people aren't aware the the council is a seven-member volunteer board they are appointed by the governor and they are confirmed by the oregon senate to fulfill that responsibility on the council um there's a process points on this slide as well and so everybody is aware once f-sec releases its draft proposed rules based on the input from the rack uh it will hold public comment period um except written comments it'll also the council will also have a public hearing at which it will accept oral comments directly to fsac those public hearings are typically at a regularly scheduled f-stack meeting and we expect that to occur um sometime next year and those mentions here we don't expect the rules to be finalized until next time a bit of a process all right next slide all right so there's a lot of information here on this slide and i'll talk through some of the notes and try and keep it moving along really this is the background so why are we here today uh as many people know we as auto staff have been more engaged on radioactive waste disposal in the past two years and this follows an illegal disposal incident at the kemwas facility chem waste management hazardous waste landfill facility it's a hazardous space landfill facility in gilliam county outside of arlington and this later led our agency to do a couple things uh beyond the immediate response to that specific incident at chem waste but we we've been working with we did work with the oregon legislature on senate bill 246 we'll discuss that a little bit later today uh that bill directs us to conduct this rulemaking as sort of one of the one of the directives from that bill itself or drex asec i should say to conduct this senate bill 246 also changes the definition of radioactive waste it expands the potentially responsible parties for illegal waste disposal to include generators waste generators and transporters in addition to uh disposal and it gives that sec our and our agency broader prevention and investigation authorities and we'll get all that sort of what those mean as we as we move on through the process here uh other things that we've done our agency now puts out an annual notice to landfills across the state regarding the radioactive waste uh we've been increa we've increased our coordination with our partner state agencies department of environmental equality and oregon health authorities radiation protection services or rps group and both of those organizations agencies are represented in our iraq as well we appreciate that coordination with our state agencies and i will also note that we've been working specifically with waste management in reviewing their waste profiles for potential sources of radioactive waste and assessing compliance with the rules and statutes and finally the last bullet notes we've been reviewing multiple pathway exemption requests in recent months and we'll get into what that means a little bit later but i'll just as a very high level note that uh the pathway exemption is a process currently in the rule uh in the division 50 rule set which requires a specific set of physical tests and laboratory analyses uh assessed against the output of those analyses is assessed against criteria that are a certain rule to determine if a particular waste stream is radioactive waste uh or not and thus allowable or not for disposal in the state and we'll talk about all this more at future rap meetings i'm just trying to set the stage of where we are right now all right tom uh next slide here broad project objectives um as i've sort of mentioned before implement directives from sentinel 246. uh we'll get into that a little bit evaluate whether changes to rules are needed to protect public health and safety pretty fundamental charge uh to have second to to this wreck and then consider what if any standards and rules are necessary to prevent disposal of radioactive waste in oregon and that last bullet also comes from the statute from sb246 so that's um sort of my quick rundown and probably enough of me talking um so what i'd like to do now is we'll go around the virtual room uh and if everybody could just take a second introduce themselves and then respond to the question i guess there's actually questions posed here on the screen um i'll note that this is the same questions that were posed in the agenda so hopefully people had a chance to to look at that and uh and contemplate you know what what exactly the response they'd like to give the idea here is we really want to make sure that we understand where all the rac members where the organizations are coming from uh your interest in the rule making and really just trying to set the stage for future meetings and so we get a fuller understanding so all the rack members get a full understanding of where any a person is coming from and what you hope as mentions here what you hope the rule making will accomplish if um folks will bear with me i think i'll just call on the representatives from that i have on my list in alphabetical order by name of the organization which puts the association of oregon aoc up first do we have drender on the line and our very first person i call it i don't know if we do um chris do you know if dorinda is on the line we have a call-in user at 503-267 oh that's dave smith um i don't believe that danger is on the way okay uh we will move over that uh going down my list in next order is confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation and mason murphy mason thank you for joining us um can you give a quick introduction and perhaps if you can respond to this question jason i'm sorry i we see that you're unmuted but we can't hear you you may need to try to go down to the mute on mute button and there should be a little carrot there that says audio options and then adjust your microphone setting there no luck sorry mason why don't we roll down to the next and mason we'll see if we can we'll come back to you we can work on the the audio there uh so next gillum county government and lisa lisa welcome thank you good morning i'm lisa atkin i'm chief of staff at gillam county and i also was fortunate to be on the rack panelists previously so thank you for inviting me back i appreciate the uh the offer to participate again for my perspective being gillam county i kind of have various lenses i'm looking at this through county government is one of my primary but also as county government we're obviously looking to reflect the best interest particularly safety of our constituents so also looking at it through that lens and then um our waste management i see jim denson is back as a panelist too so that's awesome um is one of our key and main private employers here in guilham county so that's a further lens that i'm looking at this through but obviously jim has far more technical uh expertise in that area and so we'll probably take the lion's share of that great thank you sir welcome uh mason let's try that again man yeah there it oh gosh a little troubleshooting here we are uh hello everyone my name is mason murphy i represent the confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation i'm the energy and environmental science program manager and overall one of our principal goals is to try and protect tribal treaty rights that were retained and the tribal treaty rights and resources that were retained in the treaty of 1855 there's a broad swath of land that includes which has a an assortment of various landfills one of which the arlington landfill is at so we are definitely interested in this rule making because we would like to ensure that those those resources are protected from environmental contaminants and i'm hoping that this rule making accomplishes uh some piece of that thank you great thank you mason appreciate you being here next on my list is league of women voters of oregon and shirley weathers um i don't see shirley on the panelist list though okay so are you aware of yes sorry guys i surely did call this morning and let me know that she would be trying to join part of this meeting but had a conflict oh okay okay uh we can circle uh shirley weathers represents league of women voters of oregon on iraq next on my list is oregon business and industry and charlemagne hi there can you hear me okay um go over to my notes here um thank you for having me charlotte i'm the director of energy environment natural resources and infrastructure for oregon business and industry uh obi uh is a statewide business association we have about 1600 members our members and our interests on this rack include generators of um uh naturally occurring um radioactive wastes um or material i should say material um and um haulers and disposal operators and so we kind of represent the gamut and so we were very interested in the rule making want to make sure that the any proposed rules are science-based consistent and clearly promulgated and it really boils down to some regulatory certainty for the business community to ensure that regulations are applied fairly and uniformly uniformly to generators and disposal operators um and that they can they're able to move through this process in a timely fashion and that it's not dragged out over many months so um i have you know many things many other things i could say but i think that again just really clearly promulgated uh means that generators disposal operators and members of the public can understand or easily understand uh what types of material are being disposed at what levels how that is protective of public health and safety as well as the environment and further that compliance regulations are are clear to um to everyone including members of the public so um i'll stop there uh for now and have lots to say later so thank you excellent thank you charlotte really appreciate it all right next on my list is oregon deq and jamie jones hi can you hear me yes we can great um okay so my name is jamie jones i work for the oregon department of environmental quality i'm a senior permitting um and policy specialist and i'm also the statewide lead for financial assurance for solid-based disposal sites like landfills and things like that so where we intersect you know dequeue of environmental our focus is the protection of land water air for the state um i'm part of the land quality group and when we talk about land disposal sites or disposal facilities and and things like that um the thing that uh i'm interested in and you know is where these regulations meet our regulations and how we work together um and and",

        "text": " may be a future expansion within this 116 square area I council member Devon I am probably not the best person to respond to that particular comment but um since the certificate holder is in the room with us I I believe they they possibly could okay well thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you councelor delin and and we've got another comment from counselor Grail thank you um Chris I'm not sure that I heard you correctly so I would like to ask you I think I heard you say the certificate holder speaks and I'm going to say expedited but I don't know that's the word that you used um and then you mentioned public comment and I don't know if I combine that in my own head uh or what and so I just would like to ask that and then perhaps a clarifying question if you could respond to that um yes council member Grail uh I did say expedited um that isn't intended to be a formal term like it's an expedited review or a special criteria um we uh it just means that they would like the council's decision to be as soon as possible um so they can begin construction as soon as possible um I we have not uh made any changes to our our public common period length or duration um and we have tried to give the council also as much time uh as you need to to review the facility obviously if you feel like you need more time that is your decision so thank you Mr secretary for the record Todd cornette um we've been in communication recently with council members about changing the May meeting um and so as as Chris referenced Expediting essentially we were looking at what are the opportunities to try to get the you know this through the review process faster assuming everything goes you know no contested case you know no significant um you know comments that take lots of time you know responses by the certificate holder that they then ask for additional time so assuming everything goes as smoothly as possible this is also why we requested and um sought input on potential different dates for the May meeting because even though it extended out the May meeting by two weeks that actually creates a little more space to get the the facility potentially or this amendment potentially um final a final decision by Council early earlier than it would have normally um just based on the way the deadlines hit um rather than waiting until the June meeting it allowed us to have potentially the council's review at the May meeting so that's that's what Chris is referring to thank you thank you sorry Che um councelor um councelor gra do you have a just a followup just to I do uh and so Christopher if this isn't for you that's fine I can wait for the certificate holder so my question is are they prepared to go to work immediately if they're like let's go are we are they ready uh council member girl that is what they have uh indicated to us thank you um yeah I will say there there is still preconstruction compliance that will be ongoing after that but um I believe they have already started to prepare and and get information ready so thank you councelor Byer thank you Vice chair um just to clarify this is not um to do away with any public comment opportunities um it it puts a a a different calendar for the council but we have tried to build in extra time for the public to comment on all our proposals because it gives the council a better better information to make our decisions so the word expedite is probably the wrong the wrong word um because we aren't short changing the public input period that's very important to us and um we really value any of the comments that we get because you think of questions that we just don't think of so thank you Chris for your presentation and this is you know compared to our last Amendment this is a big expansion and so it really is almost an evaluation of the project from almost Ground Zero in terms of the standards and the um plans that are required to be updated so thank you for your thorough you Council develin any further no not at this time Madam chair councelor IMS anything further thank you Mr Clark for your presentation this evening thank you very on it there we go uh this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for Amendment one to energy East site certificate I Cindy Condon Vice chair for this hearing today is March 2024 the time is is 7:14 p.m. this public hearing is being held at an energy facility sighting council meeting in person here in the Oxford room of the Oxford Suites in Hermiston this hearing is also being held via a WebEx webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar today's hearing is being recorded the presentations written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the Amendment request for the facility the purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies councel and the certificate holder if they wish to do so to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the Department's draft proposed order the 35-day record of the public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order includes the hearing tonight and is scheduled to close next Friday 8 April 4th 2024 at p.m. pursuant to O 367 parentheses 5A and B please note the following a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of energy before the April 4th 2024 deadline and specificity to afford the the and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond including a statement rep the person amendment process issues eligible for a contest back Madam Vice shair can I get you to switch with uh council member Grail it seems like your batter is out in a type a review amendment process issues eligible for a contested case must be determined by FC to quote raise a significant issue of factor law that is reasonably likely to affect unquote Council determination of compliance with an applicable standard to raise an issue in a contested case proceeding the issue must be within the council's jurisdiction raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the record of the public comment period April 4th 2024 at 5:00 pm and raised with sufficient specif specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue this slide presents the order for tonight's hearing and testimony on the record of the DPO if attendees wish to submit written comments at the hearing to staff they may do so prior to the end of the hearing I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with the certificate holder then members of the public hearing person then on the webinar then on the phone for any individuals wishing to provide oral testimony during tonight's hearing for the record please State the following with your testimony full name and spelling name of organization or group if you are representing one and your physical mail or email address is I think we know that the certificate holder is in the room would you like to make comment tonight come forward and while they're coming forward just a reminder for people that would like in the room who would like to make comment there are green forms um that you can raise your hand and somebody will bring a form to you we've got two now so thank you for being here this evening thank you thank you Vice chair uh David Lawler uh I represent um I'm in the development team for next era energy resources uh LLC and I oversee Northwest development thank you co l a w l o r David d a v i d I'm Sarah twitchel I'm the environmental permitting lead for the Pacific Northwest at nexera energy resources s a r a t w t c h l l and good evening Vice chair my name is David philippy that's spelled D a v d last name is f l PPI I am an attorney with st Reeves in Portland and I'm here on behalf of the applicant thank um we first just want to thank the council for for reviewing our our application thank the staff for the work that they put in and we are um interested in hearing the comments of of the public both tonight and throughout the uh public comment period um we were mainly here to listen and to receive the um a couple of things had come up in in previous um you could either ask the questions again or I I can go in the first one is about the site boundary just want to point out out um the the site boundary went from just the micro sighting Corridor that's why it was 4,000 the actual least Parcels were almost 42,000 Acres originally and what we've done is just gone to the least boundary and then within there that that uh as Chris had had pointed out are the micro sited corridors and those are an increase of 10,000 acres and so so it you know in a sense Apples to Apples it's 4,600 or so to 14,600 and as as one of the council members pointed out it is um I would put it as very um balsamic ridges so uh or balsamic B Bal sorry basal briges that yes I don't know if that is a a slip of tongue because I'm a little hungry no I'm um but that is um U that's the reason you you can only get up certain places up to The Ridges where where in a sense the wind is and that that's I just wanted to point that out and other than that we don't have any other where where we will be providing some some written responses to the DPO um but there's nothing particularly that we have comments for tonight and so um with that you have our names uh I believe I just wanted to confirm we would now step down as uh other public um comments happen and then we have an opportunity if if we elect to to come back up that just before you st down just because there were some questions and comments earlier if I can go to councelor delin First do you have some questions of the applicant uh no I think the applicant addressed my my issue and I realize that there'll be more impact in the area during construction that",

        "text": "rams or we we did this kind of hourly complementarity put them on a matrix there was one of those on a couple slides back it's kind of colorful matrix just to show um the the the the qualitative um uh alignment with loads hourly and uh hourly production or of of gener of electricity or consumption of electricity depending on what um which item you're looking at on the corollagram we made these um by season using multiple years of data and we came up with the following conclusions here um just some high level conclusions there are other conclusions in those corollograms but first starting the left side with resource complementarity so again this is how supply side resources might work well together or not uh the first one that we noticed was that offshore wind um there was much there was a great degree of alignment hourly across the full oregon coast um not a whole lot of variation there that which was interesting um but there was some ability inherent ability of offshoring to help balance onshore wind in the columbia river gorge and southeastern washington particularly in the summer which was interesting a fairly strong correlation there the second conclusion is that offshore one could complement oregon solar especially in the winter which is interesting when we have our regional peak loads uh that's a valuable and the third finding was that option one does not complement solar as well as terrestrial wind or onshore windows in the summer so it's uh we tried to look for um you know things that stood out in the correlations not necessarily those that were just positive to offshore wind of course um the second on the second half of the slide thinking about now how well does the inherent how does the inherent temporal production of offshore wind energy in theory match that of of loads as accrued across the major balancing authorities in the pacific northwest so now we're talking about bpat we're talking about uh portland general electric balancing area uh the pacific core west and the southwestern part of the state uh and then to the far east idaho power treasure valley balancing authority and what we found was of course solar complementarity you know it's generated during the day when most loads are happening that's the best it has a positive correlation about 0.4 and nothing else touches it um now the second finding is that that offshore wind has a fairly strong correlation with load in the winter months uh so that's important because again we peak in the winter and that's that's a helpful thing it's not just about how strong the wind speeds are they are strong but this correlation alludes to a capacity value that is even more compelling i would say um there are many strong resources out there but not many vre correlate well particularly when wind variable renewable energy resources that correlate well with load in this way inherently the third finding was that in general offshore wind complements load across all seasons better than onshore wind so again when you think about house bill 2020 think about 100 clean standards you know um option one uh offers a capacity is differentiated on capacity it matches load better as a high level general statement matches load better than we see in the existing pacific northwest onshore wind in time next slide please a quick note on on interaction with the hydro system of course hydro is not truly intermittent right we have the the large columbia river system which is although it is somewhat limited in how much power it can store or how much water it can store and that's how much power flexibility it has over any you know seasonal duration hydropower um um is also uh it's a it's a key piece of our dispatch generation we think about especially when you think about the future right if you really think ahead a decade or two hydropower is becoming even more important its dispatch ability is really really really important and precious and one thing we've noticed uh over the last several years is that well first of all there's a significant shift in the precipitation pattern less volume of snow more falling as rain so less stored in the snowpack of the mountains and more having to be stored in the river and actually the river and hydro power system is not made to store much um it's it's somewhat counterintuitive you see these large structures these large dams but really in terms of uh you know the water resource there's there's not a you know you don't without snowpack in the mountains you lose the seasonal storage so that long duration storage and slow release of the water which means the late summer months are becoming a serious pinch point for hydropower production compounding that issue is the fact that the river temperatures are are higher than they were before so now to preserve fish health the run the river has to run the dams have to spill water which further limits their ability to generate this is why we kind of target this kind of july through october time frame and say and just do a quick look and say what do the wind resources look like um uh in that period that kind of critical time for hydropower and these are just box and whisker charts that are showing you know uh outliers in the inside the box 25th to the 75th percentile of of wind speeds uh over every given month that's on the x-axis here and then the horizontal bar inside the box and whisker part uh box and whisker plot that horizontal bar is the median value uh for wind speeds uh over all hours in that month and i should say that these were computed over six years of data so and the first upper left plot is as 2007 through 2012. so you can see that the median at port or furthest was similar for offshore when locations we surveyed the median value of of wind speed is fairly robust and and the box and whisker plots are actually also pretty similar between you know kind of well you know even going back to july through through uh october over those six years if you look across to the a few of the other sides so again i just pulled one from each major area where we were looking so columbia river gorge and the upper right southeastern washington the lower left wyoming wind in the in the lower right um and you can see that the those those resources tend to fall off a bit more than offshore when so there is there is a seasonal sort of persistence or you know a more consistent uh production uh potential on a seasonal basis uh out after when which could be valuable uh in terms of interaction with the hydropower system next slide please okay and then a little bit about locational value so these what's what's interesting about um one of the things i should say that's interesting about generating power on the ocean at scale utility scales this isn't we're not talking about you know uh pilot projects we're talking about large scale and it's being proven as patrick indicated uh for floating offshore one it's certainly proven for fixed bottom offshore wind um uh you know megawatts to gigawatts of of production in the ocean and then and then interconnecting that across the coast it presents challenges but also opportunities uh from a power system perspective so some of the power quality benefits that would be accrued on the coast so there are folks right there on the coast who would immediately benefit from this um our distributed active power injection for better frequency response of regulation of the power system uh reactive power potentially for voltage regulation um certain parts of the coastal networks um where near near the point of interconnection of of the ocean when power flows um fall right through um contributions from from offshore wind turbines moderate wind turbines which are sophisticated and use a sophisticated power and can and can handle the faults and disturbances on the grid quite well and then i'll indicate also that there's a i linked to a kaiso uh report an test um from i think it was maybe it was mid-2020 it might have been mid-2019 actually where where the audi's these these uh performance characteristics were demonstrated on a utility scale park no no reason i think that couldn't happen uh in the ocean as well so type three type four machines in the ocean and then uh there are also there's also of course the avoided costs of outages reduction and backup systems potentially if one had this power supply on the coast i think adam pasted a very interesting comment earlier about the threat of the cascadia subduction zone type event and in the ability for for power generation to potentially help restore coastal power uh flows faster than than otherwise possible um there is of course a reliance on the on for much of the oregon coast reliance on the coastal transmission uh transmission across the coastal range which is um which presents a resilience challenge uh both in terms of you know uh maybe to the cascadia event uh but also wildfire so avoidance of that or less reliance on that is helpful for the coast and then the last thing i'll mention is there is a north to south there's a potential depending on how the infrastructure evolves on the transmission side for a north to south power flow alternative to some of the existing the main existing flow gates such as the california oregon ac or dc interties and i'll just for those of us in oregon probably the bootleg fire is still very much uh in our memory and um during that event there was a significant uh de-energization of the california oregon ac intertie due to arcing from that fire the fire was so large it was it was near the the ac uh transmission lines and there was arcing due to the wildfire smoke so the the the intertie had to be de-energized uh to not to not further the wildfire and so what ended up happening was not only did california lose potentially so they were talking about major system impacts here so beyond oregon they lost you know three and a half gigawatts of potential import and then and then the dc entertain had to be also de-energized not because the wildfire smoke because now the system was out of balance so there's another couple gigawatts so you know all of a sudden california is in a huge you know pinch without without some of the imports they really rely on and there are other times of the year when we rely on imports across the intertie and that could be really important for oregonians as well all right let's go to the next slide okay so a couple key findings from the oregon study uh from our our 2020 um offshore",

        "text": " too you know if this scales up really big then you know maybe there's going to be more than one ports just to support that activity so i think there's more work and studying on this it it might it might go different directions thanks jason um we're going to need to move to the next topic but i did want to um speak to the comment that ron peace has in the chat because it actually is a great segue he said it seems advantageous to explore scenarios that maximize local economic development or benefits such as job with requirements for apprenticeship and wage standards found in hb 2021 seems like having local port be a part of the construction fabrication and supply chain would be advantageous to oregon and coastal and port thanks for that that comment it's a actually a great segue to our next topic thanks everyone for the um comments and additional feedback and questions about port infrastructure and sea vessels like we've said um we're gonna have some time at the end if something else comes up on you on this topic and we continue to welcome written feedback through march 25th um go ahead jason yeah thanks ruchi i'm glad we got some engagement there that was another meaty um i mean all these topics are kind of big in their own respect so it was a great segue too you know labor considerations and economic value to the state and different communities that's kind of what we're going to talk about on this topic of economic development before we go into the feedback i'm going invite another guest speaker to our to our meeting today bring another person into the sean stevens is regional development officer and works on economic development initiatives and projects for the south coast region he's with business oregon and he's been engaged with some initial exploratory activities with offshore and potential economic economic effects it could have poor communities surrounding coastal areas in broader oregon and he's going to share a bit about just business oregon what they do the state's interests in sustainable economic development and some of the work he's been involved with relating to offshore wind and i think he's on a time constraint but hopefully he can stick around and be a resource for um for some questions people might have that was a great question i think it was from ram fees so all right sean um if you're ready i'll turn it over to you okay thank you jason you okay i think so you might be a little low on i've had some technical issues weeks so i just want to make sure everything's still working thank you jason for the introduction thank you richie and odo uh for this time jason said i'm sean stevens i'm a regional development officer for business oregon officially known as the oregon business the state's economic agency and as a regional development officer i curry and douglas county in that i work with businesses and other entities in that region uh to help fund or improvise economic development projects these slides are gonna i just have a few kind of give a brief overview of business oregon's kind of history with aside from uh offshore wind and kind of things we've seen sounds great john hey can you speak up a little bit or maybe do an adjustment on your end so i can hear when i need to move you to the next slide maybe you already asked me to is that is that better oh yeah i can hear you yeah okay i got rid of the headphones did i are you uh on this slide still are you going to go to the next one uh go on to the next one you probably gave an introduction that i may not have heard all of them go ahead to the next one there you go yes uh so as as i said uh renewable energy and offshore wind um green tech isn't a new thing to business oregon uh we've been targeting the industry it's been called different things throughout the years green tech cleantech renewable energy et cetera uh it kind of encompasses a lot of uh different industries that we've worked on in the past um seeing that you know going back to the mid 2000s under governor kulingowski uh you know we worked with onshore wind development and solar development and manufacturing most of the development was in eastern oregon up along the columbia gorge for uh wind development and and down kind of south central klamath lake area for the solar um there was a big boom in the portland area for for uh for solar manufacturing kind of during this time that's kind of died off now and you know as those industries change uh oregon's always kind of been on the leading edge of green technology and and and that type of industry uh more recent under current governor kate brown uh you know we've looked at climate tech green economy uh mass timber uh which is building um you know concrete and steel uh grade buildings out of and uh in that technology e-mobility is you know using electric cars and public transportation and uh different uh modes of transportation that that use uh different energy and uh the circular economy or known as as you can see we you know we've worked around this industry a lot in over the last uh couple decades or so next slide jason as far as offshore wind um i'm sure everybody's seen the map on the um when this was published from enroll that was kind of what kicked off kind of the interest in the it showed that oregon was a good place to do to develop offshore wind and um you know we use the economic development agency began to see several uh developers kind of coming and inquiring about the area inquiring about infrastructure and fights and that uh and and just you know what what oregon's plan for offshore wind would be i also noted that as part of my work uh i am on the bone task force uh that's been noted several times and uh and participate in those meetings i would i would know to a couple of the questions about um you know the ports and sites and there was a question earlier about uh restrictions of the airport um the one the one restriction that the portico's bay i think has is with the airport and both the swing bridge at the rails railroad crossing the mccullough bridge both cause barriers to manufacture these turbines and get them out to to see uh as jason noted you know there's height restrictions so that limits these sites to those west of the of the mccullough bridge and west of the airport at north bend so um those are you familiar with cuz area that that's some kind of limited sites and a lot of wetlands in that area so you know as this industry grows we may look at other areas to either manufacture these or have supply chain components to it go ahead and go to the next slide jason this is actually my last slide um you know one of the one of the big pieces for business oregon is uh we've managed a lot of funds for the state uh for economic development and infrastructure and and different things uh we were able to partner with uh total energies uh simply blue energy uh in the us um it's a joint venture between total energies and simply blue and the south coast development council which is the local economic development agency uh covering uh the south coast region uh on this study and there's a link at the bottom uh under the picture there to the full study uh it was just published a week ago and made public uh it's been referenced several times uh jason actually had some pictures from the study uh on it um in his presentation and so they took a look at the bay area and the infrastructure needed for the port um that the infrastructure of the stair and the infrastructure that needs to be possibly improved for an offshore wind the cost of the marine terminal the picture that jason showed earlier that had the wind turbines in the lay down area has been estimated at about 475 million where oregon where business oregon and the state of oregon can can help with this is you know helping with some of this initial infrastructure investment um both from public sense and um you know and partnering with the local developers the private developers to uh to build out these that that's that's all i have i i really i think jason had my contact information on the first slide um and i'll be happy to stay on for any hey jason or sean sorry there was one uh question in the chat i think um david missed one of the things that you said about the coos bay offshore wind port infrastructure study um you had mentioned something about it limiting sites um and he was wondering limits in what way or or where yeah the study doesn't doesn't necessarily limit sites it's just the some of the barriers in the in the queues bay mainly the bridge and and the airport uh that kind of limit where these these uh terminals can be located and uh and and the limited amount of available sites um essentially on the north spit in in in coos bay thanks sean um kathy also has a question in the chat um isn't sea level rise due to climate change and cascadia earthquake damage from liquefaction and a shaking concern for coos bay is that something that was covered in this study i don't believe it is and i i'm i'm not an expert enough to answer that question thanks and and kathy that might be uh something that we can note down to to sort of look at uh where that analysis might occur in the process and then david had a follow-up about whether um you were talking to prior to mile eight sure i don't really know that means but maybe david can expand on that or we can take take him off mute to ask but um sean maybe you know what that um yeah mile aid of the channel um and and i don't off top my head i don't know exactly where my leg is but anything west of the mccullough bridge uh area the proposed area would have to be west of the mccullough bridge okay great it looks like um that's what david's tracking with too any other questions for sean otherwise i know jason has a few more slides based on the themes um from the comments so far and then we'll take a lunch break um uh oh i see another question um in the chat from mike would the 475 million dollars for development in tuesday include the heavy equipment needed is that something that was addressed in this study or um that that business oregon has looked at yeah the 475 million that uh m",

        "text": " can see in this pie chart that um petroleum natural gas and hydro are the three biggest sources that we have we also use quite a bit of coal quite a bit of biomass wind and there are other resources in there too and on the right you can see where's that energy going about 29% of it goes to Transportation uh cars and trucks um and other Transportation about a quarter of it goes to homes little more than a quarter Powers industrial processes and about 19% uh goes to businesses so this is kind of where we use energy if we think of our um whole state split up into these four sectors uh so here's another view but now I'd like to zoom just into the electricity sector um so electricity isn't all the energy as you remember from the first slide but it's a really big part of the energy that we use and you can see here that um Hydro power accounts for the biggest share of um Oregon's electricity production there's also a big share of wind of coal and natural gas and coal and natural gas are the resources that are most responsible for our electric sector uh carbon emissions and if we um fast forward to 2040 and the 100% clean electricity standard in HB 2021 those are the sectors where we need to look at clean alternatives to decarbonize the power sector so then if we look a little bit deeper across different sectors different end use sectors if we look at the transportation sector which as you saw accounted for about 29% of our energy consumption um gasoline and Diesel account for the biggest sources of energy powering our vehicles they're also the biggest uh sources of emissions and so if we go out to 2050 um these are the places where we'll be looking to Alternative clean sources including you can see here electricity and also low carbon fuels um and we're watching the um climate Protection Program rulemaking right now and keeping in mind the important role that that um program will play in driving emissions here then if we look at buildings um here we've split up buildings into homes residential energy use and Commercial energy use or businesses and if we look at buildings you can see that the Lion's Share of our energy use is in the form of electricity that's the kind of light blue 47% 53% in this chart that's followed by natural gas and then biomass and again there's a challenge to decarbonize these sectors so that brings me to why do we need an energy strategy Oregon has ambitious energy and climate goals they cover electricity transportation and direct use fuels direct use fuels include things like fuels for industrial processes or for heating your home and there are a lot of things going on at the same time we are also seeing changing weather patterns affecting the Energy System wildfires a need for increased focus on resilience all of these things are part of the picture that we need to consider when we think about the future of our energy sector in our 2022 Bal Energy report we asked ourselves how Oregon might meet these goals um and we looked at what other states have done we reviewed 20 technical studies from around the country and we concluded that um the state would benefit from a state energy strategy and by undertaking the kinds of analysis that we've seen elsewhere an energy strategy can help align policy development regulation investment and technical assistance it can help identify Pathways to meet the state's policy goals while considering different Technologies different approaches and tradeoffs it can help maintain affordability and reliability um it can consider ways to strengthen the economy to be proactive rather than reactive in how our energy sector evolves we can prioritize equity and work to maximize benefits and harms so last summer um House Bill 3630 directed Odo to develop an energy strategy that identifies Pathways to achieve our energy policy objectives and that is informed by stakeholder perspectives and by existing resource plans energy related studies and Analysis um The Bill calls on oo devel to develop Pathways it's not just one route but rather to consider tradeoffs and that includes things like cost efficiencies feasibility and the availability of different energy resources and Technologies um economic and employment impact energy burden affordability environmental justice and Community impacts and benefits we'll also be looking at land use and natural resource impacts and considerations and things like energy resilience security and Market implications so it's a pretty tall order um the energy strategy oh yeah Jessica go ahead I think you might hi Edith I have a really great question from the uh Q&amp;A and that's from um Beth who's asking in the energy flow slide uh it's she wants to know what's waste energy since we had 772 BTUs lost um in that yes um waste energy is energy that's lost and that doesn't actually help heat your home or power your vehicle there are a lot of losses another word we can use as inefficiency and how we use energy and so this is one of the reasons that Energy Efficiency is so important so losses happen everywhere from the power plant itself um losses can just be heat that goes out into the air rather than turning the turbine there are losses that happen um on on transmission wires and distribution wires and then there are losses actually at the device level so cars are are a really good way to look at that like fuel economy standards try to reduce the losses in the car itself and make it more efficient it's a good question and I just take this opportunity since we stopped to remind folks if you've joined as a participant and haven't added your name and affiliation to the Q&amp;A we don't have a chat um on this webinar but if you could do that that would be fantastic thank you thanks Jessica um so the the energy strategy ultimately will take the form of a final report with three parts and this again comes from the bill um there'll be a summary of the energy strategy and Pathways to achieve Oregon's policy objectives there'll be a description of stakeholder engagement and how stakeholder perspectives informed the energy strategy and recommendations of policy options the starting point for this work is going to be number one it's really um undertaking the technical analysis to understand where we are today and what the different Pathways or options might be and what the trade-offs are for those different options um moving forward and so that's what I'd like to talk about next I'll start by saying that we have just kicked off work with our technical consultants the clean energy transitions Institute who we chose through a competitive procurement process and we're very excited to be working with them they really know their stuff and you'll hear more from them in the future although today you're stuck with me um um so the uh but they helped us prepare these slides and we have been speaking with them quite a bit on how we structure um the analysis um which will help us also structure in the engagement which I'll talk about in a moment so um it's useful to start with the tools that we'll be applying we're going to be undertaking a modeling exercise so a model um the model will take a look at the whole energy sector across the economy today so not just electricity not just Transportation but the whole across the whole energy sector and it will um make assumptions about how energy use and how that energy um how energy needs are met into the future importantly the modeling is going to be structured to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives including executive or order 20 um 04 which calls for an at least 80% reduction in economy wise greenhouse gas emissions um by 2050 um HB 2021 which I've already mentioned the 100% clean electricity standard the clean fuels program and climate Protection Program just to name some of the some of the really big ones but there are other um other policies in there that we'll be looking at um so the model is is is designed to to meet those objectives and within that um to look at least cost Solutions or look for least cost Solutions and by making different assumptions about the future we can evaluate the trade-offs of different Pathways and answer what if types of questions for example what if more or less transmission is available we can we can put that question into numbers in the model and into rules and in how the model works and we'll see what the effects are on the rest of the energy system and on what needs to be built and on costs and on um other um effects the model cannot answer all questions that so we'll also be conducting some complimentary analysis and applying results of the modeling to get insights into other areas like jobs like public health and like land use um and um we will also be looking to evaluate Equity effects so I think it's important to talk about the goal of the technical analysis because it's easy to get kind of lost in the in the idea of looking at the whole Energy System and kind of projecting into the future so all of this serves to inform decision- making it is not a prediction of the future um it's also not a place to debate settled policy we're going to put in where we are today the policies that we have it's not um going to answer all questions or model every future pathway there's just a limit on how much we can do so what we're doing is investigating choices to help evaluate the pros and cons of different strategies IES to try to ask strategic questions and to help identify strategies that can help manage or mitigate uncertainty there are a lot of uncertainties right now facing um the energy sector and we will be looking out to 2050 which is the TR time Horizon of executive order 204 and that will really serve to inform near-term actions needed to meet our decarbonization goals and to identify gaps and opportunities so the technical analysis is structured to help answer questions that can inform policy Direction and these questions can be driven by policy choices we might want to test what a certain policy can accomplish or they can anticipate potential risks or opportunities so here are a few examples of the types of questions that we might ask but they're not the questions we're going to ask I want to emphasize here that this is one of the things that we would like to Define through engagement with you and why we'll talk quite a bit about engagement in a little bit uh we want to work with you to identify the Strategic questions that we should be asking in the energy strategy so here are just a few examples what if developing new clean energy resources is delayed what if consumer adoption of Technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles occurs more slowly than expected what if transmission expansion to access resources outside",

        "text": "us with them so kind of keep an eye on that it should be sort of interesting to see if that changes or if that continues but um but they kind of have like a few people that like hang out as independent so kind of interesting interesting Dynamic there um so I had I had also just wanted to share a couple of just quick notes on Big Picture policy items if you will or Dynamics one is that the capital will be under construction and like pretty significant construction they're doing seismic upgrades of the sort of middle of the building for those who are familiar there's sort of an old part that includes the Rotunda and most of the basement and then there's also wings and then there's also where the Committees are is also in addition so those areas are going to be open the wings and where that Edition is but the middle of the building which includes the two legislative Chambers will be closed they're going to keep the house chamber open for session and both the Senate and the house are going to be meeting there so not necessarily at the same time but like sharing the space so I think that'll just sort of change the Dynamics about like when floor sessions are held a lot in historically the Senate house we're offer meeting at the same time so just kind of know that it'll be a little bit different from usual because of that and also if any of you come to the Capitol my understanding is that quarters are going to be very tight so just be mentally prepared and there might be some we're still kind of waiting to hear of meetings will be virtual sometimes in order to like discourage the public from coming in person because there's no space for everybody so anyway it should be interesting to see how that works and then there's also um a somewhat unclear budget picture that was yet another relatively stable revenue forecast just last week earlier this week um the December forecast happened in and so but I say it's unclear because the state economists are expecting a mild recession I mean I think anybody who's paying attention is expecting a mild recession for the country that will affect the state and how that will affect Oregon's budget is kind of to be determined for those who've been paying attention to the legislature and our state budget in the past we we sort of tend to feel the effects later because of our Reliance on income taxes so our Revenue picture might look good right now but that could change if that mild recession leads to changes in people's income the state Economist presentation made it sound like they're not as concerned about that in Oregon at this point because of the because of the continued low unemployment rate so our last recession had a high unemployment rate this doesn't seem like that'll likely to happen this time so we'll kind of see how it goes for us but our dependence on the income tax makes this very very vulnerable to the sort of ups and downs of the economy I mean we just feel it late so we'll just see how that happens but I expect that you'll see a fairly sort of small C conservative attitude toward the state budget by leaders because of that dynamic the major issues I'm sure you all already read this at this point but the governor's come right in and said housing and homelessness are her number one issues it's a Statewide issue it's not a Portland issue it's Oliver and so that'll be item number one very related to that is public is behavioral health overall there's a lot of conversations about Workforce in part because of the tightness of the hiring Market I-5 Bridge replacement was really contentious in the past and didn't happen that's coming back again as an issue our public defense system has been in crisis for quite some time in Oregon and then finally ballot measure implementation measure 114 for example the gun control ballot which I've already seen that legislators are thinking about making some tweaks or changes to that in the session ahead so I can go to the next slide and actually if anyone wants to ask questions on the big picture that would be fine and then we could go into energy topics or it can wait till the end whatever works best for you all and then yeah I think of course um thank you and did am I correct that the Democrats lost their super majority they did yes yes any thoughts on on how that plays yeah I to be completely candid I think that was just sort of a fun media story for the media to talk about I don't think it'll make any big changes in how things actually work there hasn't been much talk about taking on major tax reform or increasing taxes or anything like that and the super majority is only important when it comes to revenue votes there was a big tax measure in 2021 is that right no 2019 that came into effect later which was the Student Success act which was a new corporate activities tax that's certainly been talked a lot about since it passed and that I think it was pretty painful so I don't I mean as far as like how it felt for legislators and and how it's felt since and I don't think that anyone was planning to run up that hill again so I don't think in practice it's going to mean that much but it's definitely something I've noticed the news media really being excited to talk about thank you yeah no problem um and then anticipate sorry I couldn't hear an echo in the room so was there another question or was that just that little Echo no question great thank you so as far as energy topics goes here's why you might be seeing a lot of me or a lot of um our our citing staff talking to you about the legislative session ahead um really there's two top energy issues for this session and one of them is citing reform and we're gonna hear next month you all are gonna hear next month I'll come to um from one of the folks who's leading that particular effort and we can dig in and kind of see where that's headed for now what I can tell you is that there's been meetings with a lot of folks with a lot of different opinions on the line to talk about citing reform um those meetings have been happening for maybe three months now and um there's a placeholder legislation that would actually direct our agency the department of energy to do a study on citing reform um I think that's just a placeholder and that legislation is intended to sort of be what comes out of this group that's been meeting and talking but if nothing comes out of that group it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of study bill is what forward so I don't know much detail about that because it's all kind of to be determined so just know next month you're going to get like a whole a whole presentation on it and can ask questions of the people that are kind of leading that effort um we're tracking it closely me citing staff or paying a lot of attention so that we're ready um and I just want to make it really clear that the Coalition leader that you'll hear from next month has made it really obvious in both how she's acted and the words that she has said that she really cares about our expertise particularly I should say the expertise of our sighting team so I think we're really well positioned to make sure that we're like at that table and that your opinions and the opinions of citing staff and of the agency are considered in whatever is to come and I kind of want to pause and see if anybody wants to ask about that although again we don't know specifics or if anybody from the sighting team wants to say anything about that quickly yeah Christy uh the record talk about the thing I would say on there is uh chair grail for her day job has also been uh sitting in on those meetings maybe not every one of those but I think she's got a good handle on this as well so that obviously helps us in terms of you know her being able to help translate that to council as well but uh at that point I don't really have anything else to say about that I think we can you know unless uh chair grow would like to I think we'll just uh you know wait and hear from uh orianna magnera uh next month I think she'll be able to give a really good presentation on that the thing this is chair Grail that I'd say in addition to that just in general I've said it numerous times energy sexy right now everybody wants to play in our space and it doesn't stop and there are so many people on this meeting that Christy is talking about um that you kind of cringe and say wow it's too much too many um the other thing that keeps coming up is hydrogen now we've gone to a whole conference on that and I think when I I listen to different legislators everyone acts as if we're not doing things right now so I think it's super important that whatever we're doing that we make it clear we're we're doing things to be ready we're not just you know this boom's not coming it's super frustrating I have to be clear you know I'm here for my day job and all that uh but it's it's very fascinating to uh to listen as we move forward of how we're going to be affected and I think that some of the developers might try to jump on board with these legislators who don't think we're acting in in a prudent way quickly but I think our processes are going to be more important than ever to to stand to stand up so just an observation that I've witnessed um the last thing I'll say I watched this uh citizens Utility Board policy conference and for the first time that I'm aware they excluded all the utility CEOs and they made it a community thing and so the pressure with more people being engaged even outside of quote Professionals in the business um I I think we're going to feel a shift that I don't know what that looks like but there definitely are different perspectives that we haven't been engaged with previously if I may just kind of reiterate the point that shared robot up about the sort of narrative that's out there this is also one of the reasons why yesterday you know I felt it was important to bring up the farm and Forest report and also the sort of status of you know f-sec solar projects I mean we have 3.6 gigawatts of active solar right now just under f-sect but those narratives that are out there don't talk anything about what's happening they just talk about the need for you know the future and that's why I think it's important that you know that information gets shared it gets put out there obviously the apartment Forest report will be given to",

        "text": " they were limited parties or not so that was raised so um similarly you know depending upon her determination even until the county would uh bring that to council if they but uh it's more likely we're just gonna agree it's probably you know I don't want to presuppose anything but because it's really one issue one party um it's probably not nearly the the complexity that department having by right so it's possible but I would say a lot less likely I I would agree that there's they actually raised two issues the other issue that they raised was uh the they had commented on the DPO that Council should require the applicant to get a contingent conditional use permit in the proposed order the department did include a requirement saying you have to get a cup from the county uh during the pre-sering conference the County's attorney uh stated that they interpret the requirement to get a cup product differently than how we interpret it which is the cup would include the setback requirements so it's if you however the hearing officer results the first issue should take care of that second issue but I was just wondering about that and so the hearing officer The Next Step as Thomas mentioned will be to stay issue an order stating these other parties they'll just be you know they act into us and even though County and these are the issues so if anything they might you might see them taking issued with how the hearing officer frames up the issues for the contested pretty I understand I'm pretty familiar with the concern they're raising about their CDP but I think the statute is pretty clear okay if there are no more questions on that I will move on to the biennial Energy report uh so the department the Oregon Department of energy is biennial Energy report will be issued on November 1st so this report has developed every even numbered year in advance of the long legislative session to inform local state Regional and Federal Energy policy development energy planning and energy Investments uh once that's issued on the first I will send out a link to council members it will be posted on our website along prior by Indian energy reports however if any council members would like a paper copy you can let me know and I would include that also in the you know when they send out the link but if you want a paper copy you know now you want to be able to copy let me know and I will add you to the list I can't say exactly when that production will occur but we'll definitely make sure that that you get a paper about for the record this is chair Grill and I won yes I would like a favorite coffee I have one and I have dog years it's abused it's been very helpful in my late job to stop some of the rumors I would also tell you that Christy and others have done a really good job of reaching out to people and it's been extremely helpful to see it's frustrating I would say but it seems like so many more people are engaged in it now so um hats off to the department for the World Cup and it's being done um I will enforce it on birthday presents did you call it I too would like a copy and I I have found it so useful right now I will pass that along you know there's a lot of effort that goes into this we within the sighting Division and usually mostly me put put some time into it um but really it's a pretty huge effort um and I'd say it's just as you it's it's a really great document so but I would pass that along to uh to director Benner and others who are uh you know more of spend a lot more time producing this thing and about my ad um and I know Christy knows this but the continuous turnover of the legislature I can't help but think that the document is even more important as we continue to have this clean energy Bills going to it so um I hope that people actually do use the resources and um make decisions that are going to affect that's all uh and last on my list are the future Council meetings so uh November as I had mentioned will be a little bit earlier than typical because of Thanksgiving so that'll be the 7th 17th and the 18th uh we will need both days that will be at the Oxford Suites hotel in Hermiston so essentially the West End solar project uh which I think actually failed to mention I've been meant to do that we two days ago the drought proposed order so the public hearing on the draft post over will be the evening of the 17th um at the Oxford Suites so that'll be 5 30. and then the regular council meeting will be Friday I don't believe it'll be a very long meeting so you know maybe hopefully by early afternoon we'll be concluded on Friday then December dates in there December is also in earlier because of the holidays so I believe that's the 22nd 20 that's what's the date 15. 1600.7 15th and 16. okay I believe yeah it's probably the 15th and 16. so um I think at this point we um probably only need Friday but we'll confirm that and likely uh it will be here but we have to uh draft the agenda and then send the draft agenda and the potential meeting location to chair rail for her review and approval first but that's what I'm that's what I'm anticipating I don't believe there's any particular Geographic driver of that and unless there are any questions from council members that include my secretary Ford thank you any questions for Todd all right well then moving on to agenda Item B we have the protected area Scenic resources and Recreation standard rulemaking this Council review of public comments and consideration of permanent rules this is an action item we have senior signing analysts and rules coordinator Christopher Clark prepare to address US good morning Christopher good morning thank you chair girl uh for the record this is Christopher Clark I'm the council's rules coordinator um I do want to make one clarification uh we did put in this uh that the council could be considering the adoption of permanent rules today that's not what we're recommending so I'll explain more what our recommendation is in a minute but I just want to make it clear that um that that is an option but uh we have another option for your before I get to that I'll be giving some food control and procedural history and background on the project I'll be giving a quick overview of what's in the proposed rules uh that the council noticed on June 1st um I'll be providing an overview of the public comments uh that we received on those proposed rules and staff's recommended responses and then we'll be asking you to consider our request which is uh to appoint a fiscal impact advisory committee uh an issue an amended notice of well and authorize that to issue an amended notice of proposal making active ad committee uh so just as as uh I just discussed um this is kind of the end of this um but like other administrator processes rulemaking is not always um so uh if if the council does not agree with our recommendation you could consider the adoption proposed rules after uh we go through all the public comments and you fully consider those and had any discussion you want um we have presented an amended notice of proposed rulemaking with changes based on the comments that we uh received as part of your staff report so if you wanted to go the other way we would just utilize that set of rules but again that is not our recommendation uh and I will go through this and I'll tell us this again first um okay so for background uh the council uh must adopt standards for the sighting of energy facilities including Sanders that address areas designated protection by the state or federal government uh that includes things like monuments Wilderness areas Wildlife refuges Scenic waterways in similar areas uh the council must adopt also adopt standards for impacts of the facility on Recreation and Scenic and aesthetic um those are both provided for NRS 469 um the council has adopted three standards to address these things the particular area standard Scenic resources standard and the recreation standard the protective areas and Scenic resources standards were last updated in 2007 the recreation standard was last updated in 2002. um we started I think almost two years ago now a project to address issues related to those three standards uh the objectives that we started with were to ensure that the standards clearly identify the resources and values those standards that are intended to protect to ensure that the standards are consistent with the citing policy in four six nine through ten and to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the council's review processes and procedures by resolving ambiguity lack of clarity and inconsistency in the um we are going on um so we did start this in yeah October 2020 so I guess this has been going on for almost exactly two years um we went through several rounds of uh getting informal feedback we had some rule making workshops uh throughout the summer and fall of 2021 we came to you with our preliminary analysis and recommendations in February of this year uh went back for another round of informal advice uh and then brought our final draft of proposals to you in May uh the council approved those proposed rules and we issued our notice of proposed rulemaking on June 1st um there was a rulemaking hearing on June 23rd uh and then a public comment period that extended through July we started the review of the public comments we received at that July meeting and the council extended that review so we could look at some of the additional policy and legal issues that were brought up in public comments so that's what we're here to wrap up today great uh okay so that that is kind of the background in the procedural history uh what is actually in these proposed rules is that um we've made some pretty substantial changes to the particular um and the associated information requirements that goes along with the protected area standard um one of those changes would require an applicant to identify the managing agency of a protected area uh within the applicable study or analysis area for the project as well as any reasonably available contact information for that manager uh so that the department could provide a public notice to that manager and generate the notice of offend uh notice of intent phase and the application precise certificate based and similar times when public notice is given during the amendment process the second change is that we would amend the standard to remove the specific effective date for protected area designations that's in there that date is currently May 11 2007",

        "text": "all right welcome back Commissioners and back to you chair Harrington thank you clerk Moss appreciate it uh we have three items remaining on our work session agenda the first one includes some outside guests so we'll turn it right over to the team for the north Hillsboro industrial renewal area expansion proposal welcome mayor Callaway we're good thank you chair good to see you again and thanks to the board I've got a Commissioners for considering this item and your partnership with us for many years um commissioner Rogers you were there I think for the first you know for our first one and mayor Willie I was here when they signed your incorporation all right and I think you were here when we brought these down from the top about Sinai that's right marble tablets but I wasn't gonna go that far back I will say thank you also to commissioner Willie who um has done so much of the work that we continue need to build upon now and uh thanks again to the County commission for all of your work and support so you know what we're looking to do today are presentation our briefing is to um ask you to amend and expand our North Hillsborough industrial renewal areas we've recently seen the successes of projects like the clean water services Pump Station PG's Evergreen substation the Hitachi Global nanotechnology Innovation Center Flex Flex Central data centers and jsr micro and so um you know there's good news good potential great great possibilities for us as we move forward and with that I'll turn it over to Val akata who is our Economic Development supervisor and Dan Diaz our economic and Community Development director thank you mayor and good afternoon chair Harrington and Board of Commissioners so we have about eight slides eight or nine slides today just to get into a little bit of additional detail in the first really is where we oftentimes will start with this policy related work and establishing what is the policy basis that's informing this work in from the local Hillsborough standpoint uh those are really made up of four different areas we have our Hillsborough 2035 community plan which is our community's vision of what it would like to see Hillsboro be and continue to grow and evolve into over the next 20 years our Hillsborough comprehensive plan which also includes the Jackson East community plan that is primarily a land use and an infrastructure plan but also lays out the growth for this area up on the Northern regions of our city the existing North Hillsboro urban renewal plan so this is an expansion of an existing District that has been established a few years back and we'll talk more about that in a minute but there are policies within that existing plan and procedures within that planet we have to follow and build upon and then lastly we have to work and operate in the confines of state law primarily Oregon or by Statute in terms of the ability to enact a tax increment financing tool such as this and also coordination with partnering districts and taxing authorities such as yourselves and so you see the few of those documents on the side before you I'm not gonna run through the many many policy points within all those different plans that our community has brought forward that informed this but a couple of key policy categories that are found both in those plans as well as in the draft plan for this urban renewal District expansion are first and foremost to continue to create a vibrant local and Regional economy and in turn also have a vibrant local community in addition to that it is to emphasize the city if hillsborough's commitment to dense and efficient land use and serviceability especially across a broad array of sectors and so while today's conversation will be primarily around industrial and Manufacturing related users or to be uses we also hold the same as true for other commercial and housing areas we continue to be very focused through our Economic Development goals and policies around diversifying our industrial base both by a sector standpoint and from an economic standpoint so that's having a variety of wages available in our community to different levels of training also having a strong and robust tax base that help to provide both our local community services as well as the other taxing jurisdictions that rely on hillsborough's tax base to also help fund services and then lastly a piece uh and there's many more but the one I'll conclude on for this slide is the commitment to natural resource and open space enhancements and so there are a multitude of points within the different policy documents stated on this slide that emphasize our commitment to preserving existing and to be created natural uh corridors and Greenways while also being sensitive as we urbanize the areas within our planning Authority you'll see that reflected in the draft plan as well the city's vision for the Crescent Park Greenway which is a both a passive environmental area with also some active Trail and other amenity spaces circumvents the entire city from the stadium and Highway 26 quarter on the North End all the way around to Dairy Creek on the west end of town coming around our downtown where we sit here today and then ultimately linking uh through the South part of the the community into South Hillsborough in some of the recent housing areas down so I believe the Board of Commissioners are pretty familiar with tax increment financing but just as it relates to this District we wanted to cover the basics in case there were any questions uh in general or specifically to the proposal that we're bringing in front of you so this slide really shows that we are seeking to build upon the existing Frozen base of property taxes which were locked in when the district was originally established in 2016. um that's the dark blue band at the very bottom over the last few years in the existing District which is adjacent to the expansion area we're talking about today we have been already seeing the tax increment growth really as a byproduct and a resultant of the Investments we've made through the existing district and through the Investments that have come from the private sector into that area as well and as the mayor mentioned earlier you know we this has been done in great partnership not just with Hillsboro but with Partners like clean water services who we worked on to put a sewer pump station into the very center of this area which provides efficient and full capacity sewer system and service to the entire planned area Partners at Portland General Electric and also Partners at the County as well through a variety of different infrastructure types and then we hit a point both in the current district and in the amended District where we start to initiate some key pieces that are of both interest to the county and the city one of those is revenue sharing and we'll talk at the end of the presentation around what the existing district has been doing in terms of a tax-based growth in Revenue but during this time of abated taxes we do are required by state law but do anticipate uh in the next handful of years surpassing the 10 percent of the initial maximum indebtedness that's 10 percent of the revenues collected eclipsing about 17.2 million dollars a year which is what the maximum and deadness of the zone is that's important because at that point we start to share that blue area that up to that point is focused entirely into this geographic area into these projects a portion that starts to get shared back out with the various taxing districts that are a part of this area and then beyond that when we hit 12.5 percent of that maximum uh indebtedness number we also cap the amount of additional Revenue collected so that would increase the additional Revenue sharing opportunity and accessibility and so that's a very technical of saying what we're trying to do here is really maximize the Investments and the realization of this urban area and the tax-based growth with a Time component on there because the sooner we can deliver and achieve the full policy objectives of the area the goal is to then restore this out of the urban rural district and bring it fully back onto all of our Collective tax roles so unless there's any questions on the first two slides which I'd be happy to either answer now or at the end of the presentation I'll turn over to my colleague balukata we'll hold our questions until you've had a chance to go through the whole presentation great thank you chair Harrington County Commissioners I'm Val okada with the city of Hillsborough Economic Development Department so um I am going to go over a little bit of History so where the current boundary is located so the existing boundary of the industrial renewal district is South of Highway 26 North of Evergreen Road and West of Northeast 59th and east of Northeast so the purpose of the district is to promote the expansion of existing companies and Recruit new complementary companies to the area to provide infrastructure such as roads water sewer that can accommodate Industrial Development and to strategically plan and implement the enhancement of natural resource areas and promote open space such as the Crescent Park Greenway so this slide outlines the limits of the existing plan and our proposed amendment so we are proposing to add 192 acres to the boundary add 174 million dollars in new project costs which Dan will go over in more increased Tiff Revenue by about 42 million dollars and increase the maximum indebtedness by approximately 96 million so um I'd like to point out the photos at the top of the slide are taken from within the boundary of the industrial renewal area so the first slide on the left is of Stack infrastructure and T5 data center under construction the center slide or photo is of the Hitachi nanotechnology Innovation Center and gxo Logistics and then the slide on the right or the photo on the right is of the Evergreen substation that PGE owns in Northeast 30th Avenue so we also have a short video of the North Hillsboro Technology Park that we would like to share it highlights the progress we've made over the last few years with our partners in the area what's up so you can see a lot of the different elements in that video many of those roadways were constructed ahead of being able to be competitive for and Garner the investment of the companies you saw labeled there those were predominantly funded through uh existing urban renewal funds you see some of the roads going in are stubbed that's because in part we made a Strategic investment and the funding to date stopped and we were continuing to we'll continue to accumulate Tiff Revenue uh the tax increment finance and revenue to expand those out further what wasn't labeled and I was just making a note about we'll label in the next video is the Crescent Park Greenway going through there as",

        "text": " Zone that's where most of our facilities are located that's where I think the likelihood of most of these um there are three types of review uses within the exclusive Farm use Zone the first which isn't really a review use it's it's a use by right farming you can Farm in the exclusive Farm you Zone you don't have to ask permission you can just do it there's no review there's no no questions about that um the next is what's referred to as a type one use and so if you look at the statute the exclusive Farm use Zone it'll have type one and type two and the type one uses are very minimal review and and you're limited to what the statute includes so you can't the local governments cannot add additional requirements outside of some minimal public health and safety requirement so there is some provision for that but largely Counties have to implement and and and Council has to implement what is in that particular um described use then you have the type two uses which are conditional uses there are then quite a few elements within the land conservation and development commission statutes and rules and then local governments can add on whatever they want you know likely um and so it's a much higher level of review so there's been two meetings so far the last meeting um I think there was some agreement that the battery energy storage should be listed under a certain acreage as a type one use and over a certain acreage as a type two use um they're still working through that I think that's the best sort of idea you know because there's this minimal level of review and it probably makes sense that a really small scale battery storage project should have minimal review but I mean we're dealing with ones that are 30 40 acres in size you know that's a lot of land that's consumed by battery um so that probably justifies a higher level of review um they're still working through what those acreages would be so that's still in process but I think that's where it's going um the original Bill had really it was only a type one use no matter what size there was no discussion and then there was an optin to FC so at the end of the last meeting I had I had requested you know I think it two use justifiably can opt into FC it's just like a Wind Facility or solar facility you know and if the developer wants to do that that's fine but a type one use I kind of argued you go from this incredibly minimal review to an FC level review and I said that's that's too big of a swing um I I don't think that's a legitimate policy um that was what my argument was we'll see how that moves forward but that was the last that I had information yes trans buyer so these statutory changes would be to the land use statutes not thank you these would just be lcdc statutes so and there would be no outright something over a certain size is EC we would have no Standalone battery storage in Oregon Revis statute 469 311 which is the definition of energy facility it would not add that to your Authority but there would be an OP again as I have have requested just a type two great you um okay oh and then as part of that working group I just thought I would share with you since I I pulled all this data from all of our facilities you know to kind of show what what are we seeing now and so I'm going to run through this really quickly you can see the type of different Battery Systems there are four different types of Battery Systems I think I think they're just still trying to perfect what's the best one um you can see you know our first one was with the natural gas facility but you know most of them have been with either wind solar or combination they've been part of an original application they've been split off you know from applications they've been added on through amendments so varying permutations um you can see the the full megawatt so operational we have 136 um that are currently operational 100 under con construction 373 approved but not yet begun construction three megaw or three GW rather that are under review as part of another one and then the 1100 megawatt was the Bonanza facility which let their not 71 expire but they had proposed a very sizable battery storage so looking at megawatt you can see the range six to 1,200 with the average of 285 acreage0 2 Acres uh that's the Fort Westward one for PGE going up to 90 Acres again pretty sizable you know with an average of 27 next slide please sorry next next next slide please um they're largely you know there's two types of um sort of ones they're either done in shipping containers or shipping container type um facilities and you can see the sizes of those to buildings um so there's a lot of variation and then the decommissioning costs that that you have put on these uh for these these approved facilities so you know 1,170 just for battery energy storage so this is these are significant you know and these aren't just you know some little one shipping container these are utility scale things that we're looking at here here and there's going to be a lot more as we move forward with this state and and pretty much the United States in the world um with renewable energy battery storage is a necessary component so we will continue to see this okay um getting there so again sorry I'm taking way too long um skip the next one go to the next slide please so Nancy reached out to everybody um on the 2024 Council meeting got feedback uh I don't need to linger on this just to say I wanted to make sure that everybody saw it um we can share this out with you again if you don't have the particular dates but these are the 2024 dates and then lastly uh November 17th is our next council meeting it'll be a one-day meeting in Salem in this room um we've already put together a draft agenda sent it to chair Grail chair gra has approved it so we'll provide more details moving forward on that um but we will have a November meeting it'll be on the 17th and in this okay there's any questions we'll conclude and get to the main event which is the ru making excellent are there any questions hearing none then we will move on to agenda Item B which is the radio act excuse me thank you count uh secretary cornette we appreciate the report um the next agenda item is agenda Item B radioactive material enforcement rulemaking this is a public hearing we have Tom Jackman the citing policy analyst and rules coordinator maxw Woods assistant director for nuclear safety and emergency preparedness and Tom Cecilia Hanford Hydro oh hydrologist sorry geologist um

25th of 2024 as National Emergency Medical Services week here in Washington County so we have some of our great staff as well as a guest welcome well thank you so much chair Harrington Board of County Commissioners it's great to be here today my name is Mea santel I you she her pronouns I'm the director of Health and Human Services and as the chair said we are here today to Proclaim this week as emergency medic Services week um we're really excited to have Adrien Donner with us today as well as Tim case from our public health emergency preparedness program and we're very honored to have sitting next to me Chief Jim gearing from the Forest Grove Fire and Rescue and he will be reading today's Proclamation I will go ahead and turn it over to Adrien good morning okay let's see if I can make this thing work okay today we'll go through a quick presentation really what we wanted to do is speak very briefly to each point on the proclamation read the proclamation and then of course request that you support the proclaiming um this week as National EMS week um I want to First just thank uh all the people who make up our EMS system um we have a fantastic Alliance that brings together um all the stakeholders in uh in the county who make up the system um we have uh EMTs and paramedics in the audience today and of course in the field every day uh who do an excellent job serving the people who are in Washington County who have an emergency and they all work very hard thank you for the warning um uh the folks in the EMS system are always ready 24 hours a day seven days a week they're out there they're responding to calls they're helping people they're providing um excellent Service uh our uh EMTs and paramedics on the street uh have a high level of not only training to become an EMT or paramedic but also ongoing training within their organizations and regionally as well and I will quickly pass it off to so in the EMS system we really want to focus on the quality of care um because it's the quality that really makes the difference um and and kind of zeroing in on Cardiac Arrest uh we've been looking at at measures that have shown to make uh the most Improvement for your chances of survival and those are things like the amount of of compressions per minute um that you're giving somebody the rate at which you're compressing um reducing the number of pauses so there's not a lot of gaps so it's a lot of Contin CPR we're looking at those things and trying to identify opportunities for improvement um and part of that is uh we submit data to a a National Registry um where we can really see how our performance is locally uh compared to the state and nationally um but really one thing that I wanted to mention is that the cardiac arrest Network or the outof hospital Cardiac Arrest net um is is pretty wide um it's not only made up of our telecommunicators at wacka um but also law enforcement who arrive and um provide CPR and aeds um fire First Response and EMS uh but also public access to fibrillator um programs so um publicly available aeds uh along with uh trained citizens that can provide Hands-On CPR um as quick as possible so again getting back to the the data submission to cares it's the cardiac arrest registry to enhance survival um we love acronyms in EMS just for warned um really we are are almost double the national rate for uh survival neurologically intact that means you're kind of going back to life as you knew it before uh your cardiac arrest and that's that's pretty remarkable so to augment uh that system um you know EMS has had really a pretty significant growth in the breadth and depth of things that we do um here are a couple examples tvfr to Walton Valley Fire and Rescue infed an Innovative program where they have paramedics that have um training above um what they would come out of school with uh and they can provide um things like mobile Integrated Health and Community paramedicine it's kind of inhome uh care for for folks that are not in an acute emergency but do need help you know coordinating medications getting a doctor's appointments really kind of tying together um that um continuation of care and that Continuum of Care um and there's there's a lot of other things that even from when I started um in EMS that we do now and there's systems that use whole blood for trauma patients um using point of care ultrasound to um you know tell if somebody's heart is still beating in Cardiac Arrest or not um and looking at electrocardiograms to diagnose um heart attacks so really when you think of the VIN diagram of Public Health Public and Healthcare EMS sits for the Confluence of all three uh as Adrian mentioned there is a lot of specialized initial training and then ongoing uh training to maintain competency um here in Washington County we have at least an annual multi- agency training which we call Matt mat um and that's where all agencies toal and Valley Hillsboro and Mr Metro West everybody comes together uh over a course of days and we train on various topics that we either don't see very often like childbirth or some other pediatric uh trauma emergencies um in critical Airway uh management skills uh cardiac rest other things that um our physicians um feel is important for us to train on and we do that together because we take that training in that safe space and it applies immediately to field uh additionally we provide um a West End mat um and by that um agencies like uh Banks to a certain extent Forest Grove and Gaston um because of their large volunteer makeup um they don't have the ability to send folks on duty to to that mat training so we take it to them so everybody in the county has access um to that same training that same um skill set then train uh members of the public um as Adrian mentioned you know this it really kind of points back to um the CPR that's provided in the field um either from the citizens that have taken a CPR course uh law enforcement um or telecommunicators that are teaching somebody's CPR in the moment as it's happening um to to provide really good uh survival rates um but it's also worth mentioning that you know Cardiac Arrest gets a lot of attention which it should um but EMS does as I kind of alluded to a lot more things we respond to diabetic issues breathing chest pain um obstetrical and gynecological emergencies um it it kind of runs the gamut so really EMS provides that inhospital care at the curb side at the couch side in your living room um and the the time effort and training to develop the knowledge skills and ability at any um certification or lure level is daunting um but we do it and we do it because personally I couldn't imagine doing anything else and I think everybody else will probably agree and say the same thing can I ask a question on that slide before you move ahead uh with Washington County's rate at 75% almost double I mean it's good that we have people who are trained in this um but do we know why that is um I don't know if we can pinpoint one specific thing um but really I would say it's our our dedication to the training",

        "text": " a fire were to occur on my farm it would have minimal soil impact and there's no need for the ipc to have a soil rehabilitation plan in quite frankly contrary to idaho power's expert witness mr madison the facts provided in my direct testimony are a hundred percent accurate and specifically unique to this cropping system as supporting evidence i provided a signed written testimony of a local farmer that experienced the fire in his crop land that fire impacted his soil negatively for over six years this is a well-documented testimony that completely contradicts mr madison's it is very clear that a much larger risk exists than what was assessed in essence the risk on our section of farm has not been addressed and certainly not as adequately judge webster was incorrect in finding i did not timely offer testimony from the article by zuhulin gu into the hearing record i presented this article within the filing deadline in my declaration testimony and it is critical evidence crucial evidence related to my issue should not be overlooked mr myers you need to wrap up by leaving out this zone over our farm plays out in a number of different ways but we are at risk of soil damage in a fire fires do happen these lines do light fires that's that's a fact and our environment locally is at risk because we don't have a large history of fires in our area because we got lucky and because local residents are diligent about not mishandling fire anyway to have a fire take off things will change if a transmission line is installed it's a different you can't say that because we haven't had fires prior to this that it's not an issue we just got lucky and we've had people that care about not lighting a fire by accident and it does happen we haven't had a lot of we're very rural okay thank you very much are there questions from council councillor buyer says counselor buyer i we just touched on the fire component the wildfire component of your exception but if you could give us 20 to 30 seconds on the aerial application and your concerns vis-a-vis the power line and how you apply to your property absolutely absolutely the um the ipc has has tried to mitigate that with the lines going around fields and so on they mentioned that right in my case it runs right through a section and a half of ground that has been continuously farmed for 60 to 80 years i'm stuck with a line going right through my field what am i going to do i can't it's like there's no mitigation it goes right through it right through the middle of it i don't even know if i can farm it i can't what am i the pilot's not going to want to go anywhere near that i don't know the regulations there for my case it is a disaster there's no great option i appreciate that question i immensely i really do thank you mr myers good morning lisa rachner for the record mr meyer's exceptions raise a number of issues and i'm going to try to briefly address uh each of them but before i do that i just want to provide a little bit of context the company's wildfire mitigation plan and public safety shutoff plan for de-energizing wines company needs to sorry about that the company filed its most recent uh its 2022 plan with the public utility and that plan was approved now our understanding from mr meyer's exceptions was his concern that the public safety power shutoff plan doesn't include risk zone 461 that was an issue he brought up for the first time our understanding is that risk zone 641 includes morrow and umatilla county and i do want to assure the council members that in the wildfire mitigation plan itself the company has thoroughly addressed wildfire risk in those with respect to the public safety shutoff plan again that's the plan for de-energizing lines in certain emergency that is a living document it only covers the transmission lines that have been built it's because it's dynamic and it has to always change so b2h has not been added to that to that plan yet but it certainly will before it's energized and the company will have an appropriate plan for that the psps mr myers also alleges that the hearing officer aired by failing to consider evidence concerning the risk of fire ignition with respect to 500 kv lines however there was substantial evidence in this case by our expert addressing this issue and as idaho power's expert witness explained fires from high extra high voltage lines like a 500 kv line are extremely rare they're much less likely to cause fires because they're subject to stricter engineering and safety requirements they're high above the tree line and there are much right-of-way around around it so the hearing officer correctly found that the risk that a fire would be started from a 500 kv line was extremely was extremely low with respect to i know council member buyer wanted to know about the aerial sprain and the issue there my understanding is that um is that there is a b2h is planned right now to be routed through meyer's farmland that that was unavoidable there were a number of other constraints that led that to be the case my understanding is that microsighting of that line is available but to the extent there is some impact on the aerial spraying operations planned on his plan and we acknowledge that there will be that will become part of right-of-way negotiations and there will be discussions about com um compensation for the diminution of value of his farmlands for that reason thank you ms rachner are there questions from council council row anything i had to just be in addition to comments in this reactor made the hearing officer considered mr meyer's she found that idaho power had an can you hear me the record this is perry choctoo oh yeah i can only hear you i can't hear them i can't hear them either okay yes you can hear us now i can now we can but for about 45 seconds we could not so the starting i don't know what happened but no we cannot hear you again crystal can you hear us now i can i could hear whoever was talking now we don't hear anything oh well we're not saying anything right now counselor toot can you hear us i can hear you now okay sounds like everybody's back on board this is patrick rowe department of just two two brief comments again the hearing officer did find uh that idaho power had adequately analyzed the risk of wildfire she cited to the wildfire mitigation plan uh with regard to the aerial spraying in addition to the measures that ms with regard to potential compensation to mr myers department would also point out the recommended land use condition 14 would require the certificate holder to finalize and implement an agricultural mitigation plan that plans described an attachment k1 of the application for site certificate it includes measures to avoid mitigate repair and or provide compensation for impacts that may result from the construction or operation of the project on privately owned agricultural land okay council does anyone feel there's changes needed to the language of land use condition number nine that's the condom cindy condon and this is to i think miss mr myers and miss rachner i'm a little bit confused and i think um it has been mentioned but the substantial disagreement about the zone being adequately this specific zone that mr meyers on mr meyer's property it just science sounds diametrically no review or no analysis and then i it i think um that the people wanting to use the one that's i i think it's a disagreement about what it's called in the wildfire mitigation plan idaho power did analyze the area that b2h is going to be going through we felt that that was adequate and we do feel that that was adequate in his exceptions for the first time mr myers brought up he said well you didn't look at this whole zone and that was the first time we had ever heard that he also was specific that we hadn't brought it up in the power safety shutoff portion which is a kind of which is a different but to the extent perhaps he meant you didn't consider it at all in the mitigation plan itself i think the answer is we didn't say we're looking at this zone we said we're looking at the route that b2h goes through which would be the zone of concern for the purposes of our analysis i so i think we may just be crossing each other to so i guess that's the answer if mr myers is really referring to the wildfire mitigation plan itself mr myers is as he says in his exceptions really concerned about what's in your public safety shutoff plan what is your plan for de-energizing in the morrow county umatilla county era then the answer is mr myers is correct we don't have that in our public safety yet because that's a living document as is the welfare mitigation plan but particularly the the electrical consequences of shutting off a plan it's just very technical and it and it's going to be very specific to the line that you're talking about and what that line is connected to b2h would not yet be included it is a living document it will be included thank you and i i do understand the difference between the um power safety shut up um but is mr myers still still here i just want to be clear in his remarks today at least i don't remember that he mentioned specifically the power safety i heard it as the mitigation analysis that's what he said today and that's why i answered the way i did i just want to be clear that we might be able to get some agreement that no it was adequately or not analyzed like i i don't see mr myers in the room thank you okay with that does council feel there's any changes to land use condition nine hearing then i think we're ready for the straw poll okay so it would be to agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law on conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue sounds good ken howe and buyer hanley jenkins jordan truett perry choctoot cindy condon no you council members okay council rat cliff it's back to you okay so our other uh land use is land use issue five uh limited party is irene gilbert the issue statement is whether calculation of forest lands must be based on soil class or whether it is sufficient to consider acreage where forest is the predominant this was addressed by the hearing officer on a ruling on motion for summary determination as a number of",

of the energy facility citing Council to order Mr secretary please call the roll Ken how Henley Jenkins here Cindy Condon here Perry choctude and buyer here Mr if I share your form okay thank you Mr secretary are there any agenda modifications Vice chair we do have one agenda um due to the shorter time frame between the October and November Council meetings uh as a result of the Thanksgiving holiday where we were unable to get the October uh meeting minutes uh drafted into Council early enough for your review they are close to being done and will certainly be done for the December meeting um that is on the agenda tonight in the consent calendar for one of the boats but since you have not had a chance to review them yet um there will not be a vote on the October with tonight so that will be deferred to the December meeting um also since I'm talking about the meeting minutes uh and as part of the consent um we are asking you tonight to approve the September meeting minutes uh once again so if you recall during the September council meeting there was um a court reporter so there was a Verbatim transcript associated with the Boardman Hemingway portion of that um and when we asked Council to approve those minutes at the October meeting we hadn't received any verbatim uh excuse me any Scribner error recommended changes subsequent to that vote we did receive some from Idaho Power Corporation so we've sent those to you in the packet you have the meeting minutes that you approved from last meeting but because of the scrivener error changes we are requesting that you approve those again in reflecting those scrivener error changes as well so I wanted to be clear about that in case it wasn't very clear so those are the agenda modifications Mr by share thank you secretary Cornett so I have the following announcements please silence your cell phones those participating via phone or webinar please mute your phone and if you receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other call for those signed onto the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam reminder to council and anyone addressing the council to please remember to State your full name clearly and do not use the speakerphone feature as it will create feedback for tonight's West End solar draft proposed order public hearing there are three ways to let us know you are interested in providing comments for those in person please fill out a comment registration card available on the table near the entrance and submit to Nancy hatch for those using the WebEx you will need to use the raise your hand feature and for those on the phone only you will need to press star 3 which will alert us that you want to speak we'll go over these options again during the

energy facility council meeting shall be conducted into respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to State their positions at the appropriate times consistent with Council rules and willful accusatory offensive insulting threatening insolent or Slanders comments which disrupt the council meeting are not acceptable pursuant to Oregon's administrative rule 345-011080 any person who engages in an unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled we'll move to approval of the September 27th 2022 meeting minutes with the scrivener errors Corrections submitted by Idaho Power Corporation this is handling I'll move that we approved those events with the script that emotion do I have a second second okay thank you secretary Cornett could you call the roll Ken Howe yes and buyer yes and the Yankees yes very shock picture Cindy Condon yes uh and chair bro I assume you want to recuse yourself on this one it's the meeting minutes from September with the script narrow changes to the Boardman Hemingway verbatim transcript so yes I'm pretty accusing uh motion carriers thank you secretary Cornell um it's time for the uh Council secretary report and then I'm turning it back over to chair Grail um I apologize in my head I had 5 30. so I apologize to all of you for being late um wow sorry yes first I have a council member update so Richard Devlin has been appointed by Governor Brown to replace uh councilmember Jenkins on the council so Mr Devlin previously served in the Oregon House of Representatives representing the 24th district from 1996 through 2000 when he was elected to the Oregon State Senate representing the 19th district and started until 2017. he served as the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2010 in October 2017 Mr Devon was appointed by Governor Brown's Northwest power and conservation Council and served on the council through 2021. so Mr Devlin is one of numerous uh appointees by Governor Brown for the next round of Senate uh kind of Senate rules committee evaluation which will be during the December legislative days um on I think the 7th through the 9th so right now again he's on the formal list and should he be confirmed by the Senate he will replace council member things are in transition right now at the governor's office so that's what we know right now just wanted to be clear on that I have a few project updates first is the Oregon Trail solar facility I try to provide an update on the amendment so there's an amendment associated with that project which would be to extend the beginning construction time frame as well as to alter a condition related to cultural resources the project as approved is a combination of wind and solar facility components not to exceed 41 megawatts including up to 16 wind turbines or up to 1220 Acres of solar PV energy equipment the certificate holder is Oregon Trail solar LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary uh oven grid Renewables LLC the U.S division of the parent company the groupola sa on August 30th we received that amendment number uh Amendment one request included in that request was a request for type B review so under the council's type B review amendment process on November 10th of this year the department made the determination the type B review was not justified and that the amendment would be reviewed into the type a process that determination is based upon the complexity of proposed change the anticipated level of public interest and the anticipated level of Interest by recruiting agencies so just as a reminder for type B review determinations only the certificate holder can raise that determination by the staff to the council so if the certificate holder would like they can request that Council or staff determination be brought to council for your either concurrence modification or redirection so we have not heard that they intend to do that but that is their option next is the Nolan Hills wind project contest a case uh provided you an update you've also got an update from the hearing officer so the council appointed hearing officer um is administrative law judge Kate Triana and she's recently issued an order on party status that was done on November 2nd of this year and she granted the one requesting party into the county status so they have status in that contested case and a pre-hearing conference is currently being scheduled so dates have already been sent out and that's being worked on to schedule that right now there's no questions on those I'm going to move on to others so if you can bring up the slide remember capture yes um could you go back on the organ fail solar yes so there were two issues there for the amendment um the beginning of the construction date and what was the second one uh there's a quote they there's a condition related to cultural resource monitoring on-site monitoring and so they've requested that be changed uh and so it was a site monitoring during construction yes um and so I don't have the details in front of me right now I'm sure I could Sarah to come up and provide more specific details uh but it but it's effectively about on-site cultural resource monitoring uh during construction and they're requesting some alteration to that condition thank you um good so on the slide uh is some information related to the uh Department of land conservation and developments farm and Forest report or rather their draft farm and Forest report so as you can see on the slide and I won't read it but under the the uh the the department is required to generate a farm enforcement report every two years so just prior to the legislative session that gets sent to the land conservation and development commission for their review and approval and assuming it gets approved that gets provided to the legislature again prior to the long session so what effectively it does is it evaluates all of the land use approvals on farm and Forest ground you know during the last two years so it's a compilation of effectively conversion of the farm and Forest lands and so the current uh farm and force specialist Hillary foot drafted it I sent this out to council or at least links to the document and it's draft form um I've heard from council member Jenkins that he had heard it was approved by the land conservation development commission today I don't know if there are any alterations to it but the link that I provided to you was essentially for the lcdc meeting so if they did provide or make any changes we'll certainly make note of that and and let you know about that um getting into some of the specifics so I would encourage you to go look at that it's you know it's not a very long report and most of it's not related to uh information you know associated with what we do but there is a component related to energy generation projects which is I think very interesting to um and so I took some of the information from that report and essentially crunched those numbers and so you can see and this is specific to solar so you know even the energy generation is not solely related to solar as wind as well but but the information because mostly what we're seeing is solar projects these days I thought I would just focus specifically on that so since 2011 you can see that on exclusive Farm use owned land there has been 167 approved projects so these are not proposed projects these are not ones that are application these are",

        "text": " the measurement process. At the end of the day, we were successful in being eligible for two of the three criteria. We were not eligible ultimately, in terms of where they landed, the final criteria, which gets back to percentage of your population in households that are deeply Hoff burden for federal metrics, I just wanted to flag that for the council, in case you weren't aware of that would have been another similar one time avenue to this discussion. But as we read and apply, the way that final bill shook out is we are not eligible as a result. Thanks for all that context. Does anybody else want to make comment on this before we move on to the next section? Just that we need to keep moving. Likely more to go, I think maybe eight more. So partnerships. You have many active partnerships, all due to a couple metro. These are active relationships you have going, but there's ultimate housing being produced in Hillsborough. You also administrate a couple different grant program funds and support nonprofits that way. But there's more that could be done. And so some of the ideas that the product team wanted to bring to this group was the idea of one convening an implementation working group. So our group essentially to track and advise on track of it potentially, you know, could take on other activities beyond that. But right now, just tracking and advising is what we have. Another thing that you can do that we've touched on at various points today is advocating to safety federal companies. I believe we heard about the need for infrastructure funding earlier. Certainly there's a brand new funding for affordable housing. And I think we've also heard about the importance of ownership as part of this equation, but how that can be really difficult at a denser scale. So one of the major hurdles to that is construction. It really prevents condos from being a housing common housing solution in Oregon. So it's something that I think staff already has as an idea for things that Hillsboro could continue to or begin advocating. So we'd love to hear your comments on those. Yeah, I just want to add on just one other element to number nine that I also heard that could be fruitful avenue for state consideration. It relates to the CC and Rs private evidence. There are limitations on what local governments can do there since it's a private party and there may be trying to connect a few dots that we. Anybody have any guidance or questions, support or concern they'd like to express about those strategies? Anything missing? I have to go to the mayor's idea of crazy ideas. I have two questions and if the answer is no, we can't do that, then I'd love to see it included in partnerships so that we can do it. How about no, we can't do it next six months. Yeah, that too. Okay, so first on is can we assess taxes on people who are either corporations that are owning single family homes. So basically investor companies that are buying them up for rentals and can we also have a tax on people who flip houses? So if you were to move houses within, let's just say two years, three years of owning it, you don't get the capital income or you know, we add an additional tax. Are those things we as a city can do? I've always been under the assumption that like real estate transfer taxes overall are like we can't do them. And the only local entity that is allowed to, it's Washington county because they got lucky and did it or they got grandfathered in. But are those things we can do? We wish we had a lawyer with us here. But I guess what I would say is no worries on answered question, but I would say if we can't do them, I would love to talk about state partnerships, to have the state do it. And if we can do them, I'd love to add them to policy. So basically saying, hey, if you're going to flip a house, that is something that's turning a lower cost house into a higher income house. Often I'm saying at least. And then also if you're a corporation that's owning a dwelling unit that someone should be living in, then we are going to tax you. Or those are my two thoughts and I thought about the last one is how then I there's an additional fee. We make sure that doesn't get passed on to the renter because then that adds to a rent that very well could happen. And it also communicates that much like the rental, the cap on rent increases, it could cause folks to then sell that home, which could then be common. So you're right, there is a potential for a perverse incentive. Can I ask just one additional clarifying question as we maybe take that away and work on response back it almost. So you mentioned, you know, corporations that are owning single dwellings, whether they're renting them out on a long term basis or a short term basis, sounds like it is indiscriminate. It's just that ownership model and then the rental model and the flipping. Would you also include short term rentals in that same vein? I know we just recently brought a quick package that council approved, and there was a bit of debate and discussion on that, both at the planning commission, at the city council level. Is that also in that category from the thinking, or should that be left to the side? I think at the moment it could be left to the side just because that's existing and stuff, but potentially on new ones. If you're going to say, hey, I'm going to take a home that someone, family did live in, I'm going to convert it to a short term rental, that's something that I think could be potentially saying, you know, the existing plain field is what it is. But. But if we're going to add to it and recognize the impact that short term rentals do have on our housing prices, I think that's another one. So thank you for expiring crazy. You know, we have, you know, county government that will periodically sell off section eight health that they don't. And so maybe that's not something we want to get into, but we can facilitate so that it does become under occupied yet with subsidy or whatever. It would be great to capture some of these activities. A question just to get clarity, when you're talking about beyond the flipping and when Director Diaz conveyed clarification about ultimate corporate investment homes, procedural dwelling for single home, are we talking about short term rentals with corporate investors purchasing homes and then adding extra tax onto them for short term rentals? Is that what you're conveying? Yeah, that's part of it, yeah. And so that's different than the flipping? Yeah. So the idea would be, let's say a company comes in, owns a single family home with the intent renting it out to make money. That's something that, while a valid enterprise, it also is something that we recognize increases housing prices depending on how they're setting rents. It could also be something that's actually pricing folks out of the market. Therefore, we say, hey, that has a cost to our community. We're going to tax you to be able to add the benefit to the community to mitigate some of those farms. And then also on that short term rental would be the same concept. The same concept. Yep. Thank you. Two quick thoughts on this part of the conversation. I know that there's some, we're going to have to take this back and report back to some ideas, but I know that they're occupancy, permanent occupancy, primary residency. Those are some of the sort of policy hooks that I know some communities are communities typically, that have a large setting of their home market. So on the coast or in central Oregon, that's one little angle. But the other, we are aware of some communities that have struck intergovernmental agreements with the county to provide either a land trust for a city with writer first refusal or tax delinquent options. Right. So, you know, counties usually just tax it when they have to propose a property, they'll sell it. But there could be a sort of an interim step to provide at least the first right of refusal for a land trust or jurisdiction. We're unaware. A little bit of legal due diligence on that particular question. We're unaware. And so that could be, that could be related to the section eight component as well. Right. If you decide to pass, that's your prerogative, but at least you get a bite of it. You said there is a place that's done in. We've only, I'm unaware of a place that has that in Oregon. We've done some work in other states that have that agreement in place between accounts and a jurisdiction or non stop it, but we have done a little bit of legal due diligence fund and are unawares for reasons why legally it would not be applied. All right. A lot of great ideas up here. Wondering if people feel ready to move on to the next substrate. Last up are incentives and then investments. So two, that sort of financial care. A couple key strategies that you already have in place. You have some property tax exemptions that support housing. You offer that to nonprofits that provide low income housing, low income rental housing specifically in your community. And you also have vertical housing as it adopted. So you have Zillow's for that, and you provide tax credit for that. Those programs all have different flavors. So I'll hold off from providing any additional details, but if you have questions, you also have a program, or I guess not a program. You have in the past, in one instance, deferred SDCPs until the certificate of occupancy. In the case of one, affordable housing not century common, you know, that comes with some logistical hurdles. It comes with cost of figuring out how to do that, but it can make a meaningful difference. A small difference in making it so you don't have to as a developer finance sdcs or get that",

        "text": " which is a little bit different from them what you also emailed so we're like let's not let's just look at um I'm just gonna suggest we look at just the stack report and we can kind of go and just have a conversation from their first simplicity's sake that I and oops works make that bigger so this is what's in the stack of December 9 is that correct what we're actually going to be proposing of slightly conversion to the back language well depending on what council wants to do yeah yeah but consistent with how I how I capture that um Patrick's recommended language that that isn't that kind of opens it up to not just violations but also you know instances or circumstances but maybe it kind of opens it up a little bit more broadly it's about language this is handling language you're proposing is um in some work six identify instance of repeat or multiple violations and let me pull up what Patrick sent you know we haven't so this is eliminate the navigation bar that would be yeah It's Gonna Go the language on top is what is in the staff report and then I had suggested and you can see I explain the rationale for it oh I took that I took it out but your rationale is right no it's still there it says after app that it seem to suggest council could only adjust the RFA that looks like it did not completely come over yeah the idea is and I want to make sure we're on the same page so the idea is as a facility is being operated what we've been seeing over the last several months is that there are incidents that are occurring at these facilities that if enough of them happen we don't you know but they're in a certain nature it might call into question is the financial Assurance mechanism our estimate of how much it's going to cost to retire this facility is that still valid or are we seeing things that are happening on the ground that caused us to question whether we want to revisit the amount of the financial Assurance mechanism so the intent of this condition is to say if we're seeing incidents doesn't mean I don't want it to have to be a violation I don't want to have to get into a dispute with the certificate holders whether or not there's actually been a violation if console the department of believes there's things happening out on the landscape that cause us to question the amount of the financial Assurance mechanism this condition would give us the ability to revisit that The Five-Year period uh seems long to me is there they report annually on other things so can you just explain a little bit Wi-Fi Gear Well we wanted to if these facilities really were looking at a long life they represent generally a 30 to 40 year facility life but really with you know repowering later on these facilities potentially may be on the landscape for a while and it you know I guess it's like say that there is a violation or um what Patrick's recommendation under here or just something reportable or that is like that like maybe something minor you know like oil spills I you know don't care about that sure but maybe if it's like you know it happens 16 times in a year like then we care but if it happens like once a year when you know during some maintenance and but maybe uh something like really egregious happens and it's this one-time thing and it comes to council when we talk about it and deal with it and it's addressed and cleaned up and that would be captured in that annual report but like and then say it's like new staff and new council members right um and but then the same egregious thing happens the next year that only really shows up in that one annual it gives a way of getting a longer term perspective on how is operational you know are are there these reoccurring things that if you pull back and look at a bigger span of time that we're seeing this pattern not just a blip in a year um uh it's in five years is just kind of I mean we could make it three years ten years and I think there might be misunderstanding we're not saying that we're only going to revisit this every five years I'm saying that when you are aware of some type of incident that might be a violation and that also tell us everything that's happened over the level we we already have that information really and are we tracking packing it so it would be somewhere here this is just an additional you'll do it by weird uh or you'll report for a five-year period yeah and and I know that that Wally has been doing work with the incident reporting and we've kind of we've we're the compliance program is really kind of morphing into something you know more comprehensive and like immediate and responsive and we're changing how we're tracking but is there something you know we don't have a matrix like right now with our staff because your staff has been here all of us have been here for a while we have the institutional knowledge of knowing we know what projects what happened because we remember but if something happened hopefully it's that we all win the um or if one person does everybody shares it right okay agree um deal so you know but if we're all gone it provides some sort of resiliency so if we have all new staff that is that doesn't have the last five years of annual reports from all of our all of our operational facilities memorized um because we don't have a database that actually compiles all of that at this time you know in the two or three years that maybe we would and that would be valuable and then maybe this would be you know anyhow so yes it is potentially duplicative information but it's a bundling that comes in within instant with it with an incident report or like a via what is the reporting thing uh so just a second let me interrupt you Kellen please the focus shouldn't be on uh the reporting the focus should be on the whether or not you're changing the amount for the retirement and that's I think that's the important part of this is that it's a re-evaluation of whether or not there's enough money there for right so it's not it's not a fix either on a one year or a five year it's a we need to look at whether or not we're going to adjust the speed yeah and that I I get that I'm just trying to figure out how this works like um let's say there are multiple oil events so we have one in 2022 and 2023. as I read this it's a multiple full event every time in it happens and then I have to report over the five-year period yeah so it gets reported every year yeah that gets addressed every time it happens yeah well within each incident I would have to report the incident within 30 days sure and I'm just trying to work through this 30 days and now I've got my report and then it says and Report uh the multiple incidents over five years so I'm doing that every time every time there's you report this report incident or circumstance that may violate the terms or conditions of the site certificate and there's other to that but that's so right that's that's this okay sorry I I just need to get this straight in my mind submit a written report within 30 days of describary to the department okay and then that let's say it's a multiple incident it's my third incident so identify instances or repeat so okay this is a repeat so now I have to go back five years every time I report within 30 days is that I mean it seems like that's going to be some moving five-year period it seems like there's going to be a lot of recording and maybe that's what you want if there are a lot of multiple events we're just trying to get it straight well yeah and it's all I do see what you're saying because also you know I don't want to be dismissive but there may be some things that we just don't care about or it's not right I don't you know like your electrician came out to rewire a widget and a his head gasket is leaky and there's a you know five inch diameter oil spot on the ground you know so I don't think that that would reach the threshold of this because then we would have to be like go back to our site certificate condition but I actually do think we have a condition that's reporting you know spills but it's as it impacts soil so if it's on gravel anyhow um I do see what you're saying now in the first version we did we make you know so that's one advantage of maybe having it be you know violations of the site certificate is this kind of raises the bar of what's done it's less you may get less of the the piddly things that just occur on a site that maybe we don't care about and I'm sorry if I'm saying that in a dismissive manner for a second so I've been trying to to read it from the applicant's point of view and they're like what have I been in what am I going to be responsible for not what you might dismiss because I'm not sure I want the applicant or I think the science certificate holder should be deciding what's dismissable well it's all well it's all it's all based on the you know that list of site certificate conditions right so this is all what's required in all of the site certificate conditions right but it's one thing for you to say own this it's quite another for the state certificate holder so if I may what what is the trigger point to do the five-year look back so I think that's that's the clarity that's missing in this language I think family's spot on that the real importantly spirit is that once we have five years of History we can make this adjustment to the retirement month if we need to and that's that's the real gem here it doesn't change any of our other reporting requirements such as authorizes the department to kind of look at that Financial guarantee but look at that five-year language and say so what triggers it I get my certificate on day one is it a five-year look back from them or is it a role that you think which would be awful for you all to to track and helpful for the applicant to track so what starts that five-year clock is it the first incident or is it the issuance of the certificate what what what puts that on the calendar I think that's the confusion here and I think that could that could be relative resolved relatively yeah what I want to make sure and if we're clear on the record is are",

comment yeah so yeah I was to read that forgetting that I couldn't find them and I think we just will roll this item to meeting okay uh Council secretary report thank you Mr chair um so I have one project update this is on the Sunstone solar project so this is a 1200 megawatt solar facility energy story put the slide thank you and we're getting a a slide own subsidiary yeah B can you kind of small I can um yeah so you can see on the screen um the map very Wardman which is where we're sitting now and you can see yeah thank you which does have any Pits on it so then so Kate can you hear me yeah okay well hopefully everybody can hear me I'll lean in a little bit um so the yeah on the screen you can see then the blue outline that's the outline of the the project and then if you want to go down to the next slide please so here's a more zoomed in picture of it um you can see kind of the underlying land um okay good thank you Kate I think it's just leaning in probably good reminder that for everybody to lean into the microphone so you can hear um so this is also a little bit of a plug for the ARA tool so this is all taken from the ARA tool so um what I ended up doing was you know just putting on that layer uh and then um clipped it from aressa into just a PDF and then Dro it into the slide so another plug to just say please use the aressa tool um there's a lot of value in it and easy way to kind of find and and see things um so the whole point of bringing up this project is next Wednesday June 25th in this exact same room there will be a public informational meeting on the complete application so that will start at 5:00 and from 5 to 5:30 um we'll have an opportunity to just do one-on-one conversations uh with members of the public so um staff will be here the applicant will be here um and then at 5:30 uh the department will start the uh presentation and so that will be Chris Clark who's the lead analyst for that project um Chase will be out here as well as well as Nancy so they'll be out again in less than a week um so Chris will provide an overview of the FC process and this will be the first time where um he's going to do an overview of the aressa tool again you know we've talked about mapping has been a big thing lately we want to make sure people know the tool that's available and how to use it it is quite sophisticated um has a lot of value but does definitely you know need I think people need a little help in figuring out how where to access it how to kind of play around with it so uh Chris is going to do that and then he's also going to share people how to uh provide comments on the public comment portal so so that's this is the right time to do that um I think we'll we'll build that into our public informational meetings um at both the a notice of intent stage and the comple in stage from now on and I know Chris has provided a notice to all the council members I think one or two of you have responded so if you're interested in attending please contact him you are absolutely more than welcome to either attend virtually or in person we just have to make sure that there's not a quorum because that then establishes a council meeting so please coordinate with him if you plan to attend it either um next slide please so we have one compliance issue to bring up so this is related to the state line win project that project was approved in 2001 it consists of two Geographic units uh a total of 229 wind turbines the project is um that's the Oregon side there's also a portion of the project in the Washington side um but that's under the jurisdiction of the Washington energy facility site evaluation Council so on May 21st the department received uh notice from the certificate holder which is a subsidiary of nextera of a fire that occurred in one of the turbin they reported there were no injuries and the fire was contained to the nisel condition number 23 of the eth amended site certificate requires notification to the department within 72 hours of an incident such as a fire we received notice on the same day so they definitely met that they also stated the wind turbine can be repaired um this is still a fairly new incident so we really don't have much um beyond that other than to share with you uh some photos so n can please Advance the slide there you can see on the left you can see the burn kind of underneath the nisel and then the right is photo of inside the nisel and then there's one more slide please so they were you know the basically the fire got triggered they shut off the vents the fire kind of put itself out um ultimately but uh probably did some pretty clearly some significant damage inside the Nel so this is really all the information we have at this point in time and and should there be anything else um we'll provide that to council okay if there's can I ask a quick question Cindy conon for the record so how were um they aware of the firing the first what is that an automatic process yeah yeah I mean there's either you either somebody visually sees it but but most of there's like a scatter system associated with you know each the entire turban system so they have like a pretty sophisticated control room um that monitors all the details associated with each of the wind turbin so I'm assuming that was what triggered it so an alarm goes off and that triggers response and um is there a grassland near B you know underneath the um I would I would assume so I'd have to go yeah we'd have to basically identify the turban and then zoom in on the ARA tool to find out exactly what it is but um most of that area is uh you know Dryland wheat I I don't know for certain I'm just making an assumption here thank you chair how I have a question uh yes um cast so the number that's provided on your presentation you can actually go into the M the Arisa and find that turbine I don't know if that one's in there um so I've not done that myself to figure out so they did provide um I can provide the information to council where they provided almost like a Google map with the location of it um there are apps where you can find you know the wind turban locations I think there's a layer on the aressa that has all of the wind turban locations as well I don't know if the data associated with those points coincide with the that I mean the the wind turbine is hg-2 so I don't know if that corresponds with that information on there or not okay I mean if if you wanted to we could certainly identify that for you I was just curious really yeah thanks um okay next on my list is uh an overview I sent last week um the department of energy provided a presentation to the house interim committee on climate energy and environment that was on Wednesday so it consisted of several parts so the first part was uh director Janine Benner and Ruchi Sadir who's the associate director for Street strategic engagement so they did a more overview of um you know energy in Oregon uh what the needs are um going over the strategic planning effort that they agency is engaged in right now uh which we should have a presentation on that to council at the next council meeting um and um they got quite a few questions then Sarah esterson did a overview basically an FC 101 so she did a great job I'd encourage you guys to look uh watch the the recording then Sarah did a presentation with Jerry Jeremy Thompson who our ladies on Department offici w life",

        "text": " awarded for planning or developing or what we call construction Community renewable energy projects that qualify as Community energy resilience projects or those projects that are going to have a resilience aspect or components applied to that project and then 50 or more for Grants to be awarded for planning or developing Community renewable energy projects that primarily serve one or more environmental justice communities and I just wanted to go over that as we move into the next slide and uh for our uh discussion today we wanted to explore scoring criteria um based on feedback from internal external reviewers following the first two rounds of competitive review that the team has received um the scoring criteria or has the team has returned back to the scoring criteria for each of the opportunity announcements to explore potential adjustments there and the feedback from rounds one and two uh were a requests made to provide better Clarity to applicants and reviewers on the scoring criteria themselves as it relates to their projects for scoring along with recommendations to provide more even consistent scoring and in this case across key project details and the program priorities that were set by the legislature back in 2021. uh based on that feedback and the Lessons Learned internally two areas that we're looking at uh exploring adjustments to are the combined scoring that comes with the project strength and the equity criteria categories and as well as updating the criteria language descriptions for better Clarity and guidance for our applicants and reviewers and so for today's discussion we would uh we wanted to get members thoughts and feedback and insights on separating those scoring items in the project strength and the equity criteria as and putting each of those scoring opportunities into single individual scoring items and so for the first one we'll just go ahead and jump into the project string and so as you can see on screen here the current way is we have 45 points combined and several of those items come through for project team operations plan project description financial plan and then of course on construction projects we have that construction plan uh each of these combines several questions across the application and then at the end of scoring reviewers are looking at then combining and giving a a lump score up to 45 points for all of these various criteria uh one of the uh one of the adjustments the team has looked at and looking to explore is to break those out as well as combine some of those related items uh into one scoring section to provide a more specific score against these key aspects to a project and in this case we'd be looking at or exploring a team sport10 plan and schedule combined at 15 budget and finances also combined at 15. and then at the same time going back to those legislative priorities bringing the resilience aspects into the scoring criteria for project strength across all projects and bringing that in at a score of 10 and this would be both in planning and construction projects in a single Criterion and so I will just start with that one and see what some of the thoughts are from our committee members Pros cons or uh or just just general input or questions um maybe we'll try going a little different if um Alexander has her hand up oh good okay excellent thanks thanks everyone um I mostly I mean I think it it sounds good so far for me to have a separate category for resilience aspects I'm mostly wondering how is that measured like what are those metrics or what other questions that are being asked um and I kind of have that question just in general with all of these four um just to kind of get a little bit more detail of what people are looking for when scoring this um and what makes a score higher or lower so if there is any information about that but overall I think it is um it feels like a good way to be able measure some more like resilience aspects of uh projects but again what what does that kind of mean for y'all or for the um the the grant makers who are actually reading through and scoring the okay um I'll take the the last part on the resilience aspects and then um I think clay probably has the uh descriptions in the current OAS and and some of the adjusted ones that we have been uh that we've been working with um or you can maybe give a little bit more specific information straight from the criteria for the opportunity announcement about questions that relate to Team Planning schedule uh one of the ideas that we came up with of bringing the resilience aspects up into project strength as uh as its own score line there is both based on the legislative priorities but the other piece is that in our current Matrix or matrices we in in non in the renewable only projects we actually don't have any resilience based questioning but but you can actually apply in a renewable only project and have resilience components in that project for whatever reason and so one of the ideas here is this is both a program priority and at the same time this does allow people to be able to gain scores even in a renewable only so that you're not immediately disqualifying or or waiting those scores across the board and Clay do you want to maybe give a little bit more clarity on the specific line items and our combined um for the other for team and schedule um did you have a follow-up Alejandra I see your hand is up or is that part of the same the same hand raise yeah it's just the same handwrites I could put it down right now um and it's just to expand on the question too is like what's the definition of resilience that is being used here is it the same definition from um from the build text itself or our resilience aspects being measured in a different way nope it's it's very specifically right out of the statute and it because it is so specific in you know for this program and I'm going to paraphrase just to keep things quick um but it is basically resilience is support to public structures or public servicing structures that support a community in the event of a grid outage so it's a very specific definition of resilience and folks can find that in the statute and also in the program rules and in as far as the scoring criteria and the questions that are asked so we have the scoring criteria which you know was previously created and this is what we're talking about editing which is in the opportunity announcements and that's very specific and it shows all the points and it has kind of sort of summary language about what those points mean and how they're scored but it really is all of it points back to the specific questions or requirements of the application that are in section two of the opportunity announcements about what make a complete application and that's where anybody can read all of those specific requirements of an application and all the detailed questions we're asking and so what we want people to do and in our training videos and other guidance we're asking folks then to relate the application requirements to the scoring criteria and that's how an applicant can make sure that their projects are making the strongest um you know are built in the strongest way to Target this grant if you will not the application but the project itself so that way when you're answering questions in the application it relates back to your actual project plan and then relates to the scoring criteria that's in the also in the opportunity and of course all of that the opportunity now that all of that goes back to the Oregon administrative rule that the OA that the opportunity announcers were written from and then the Oregon administrative rules report back to the statute that created the program itself and you can you can follow that language all the way through to the scoring criteria and to the to the application all right thank you thank you so much Alessandra do you have any follow-up with them no I think that's good I might have follow-up later um but glad to to continue having the discussion right and and I also did want to make sure um that uh I wanted to make sure that I also say that you know our purpose here with these discussions you know is to have this initial discussion with committee members um and then upon our discussion and feedback if advised we've been looking to move forward with with uh creating um that final scoring criteria change and scoring changes and line items uh that we would send out to members to be able to review that as well uh prior to going into a future round whether that be round three or or further out uh so um I want to make sure that this is really an exploratory discussion and then we've put a few ideas together to try to see solicit some feedback and input on that so we appreciate your uh do any of the other members uh have a question or some feedback Pro or con Jason Jenny's hand is up engine if you're able um if you're able to go on camera please do if not we um uh I am can you hear me can you see me okay I can hear you yeah how are you doing good how are you doing um thanks Jason thanks Clay I think this is a good Third Edition um I think that um the including resilience aspects um is a great uh idea at this at this level um I am I I'm actually I'm wondering if at this point it's kind of a technical um component that you're asking for the for teams to share resilience from the technical aspect and maybe like the communities being served would be showing up later in the uh the document under the another other sections is that how it's going to be split out yeah the uh Mo those other sections uh the scoring criteria from that that was put together from this committee uh addressed those areas that was in statute carried over to rule so we're not where there's nothing there are no uh scoring criteria items that are being changed or removed uh we're just looking at creating line items scoring over key project details and then you'll see in the next slide over some of the equity details so that we're not looking at these lump sum scores uh these would be scored on specific aspects related aspects as the reviewers go through a particular project so these there's no questions being changed on the application there's no other scoring criteria that are being removed we may have some point adjustments on some of those other line items to help create that even consistency across applications and project types but in this case the idea to move the resilient aspect up it was its own question and or its own line item score within the resilience projects for planning and Construction in this iteration we're looking at bringing that into the project strength area because it's a it's an overriding goal of the program and making that a part of the project strength the scoring category",

        "text": " a number of airports now New York Times reports that 20 of all Municipal airports have some solar a few airports including Chattanooga Tennessee have all of their electric electrical operation needs met by solar attended into the 2.8 megawatt system that covers all their operational needs which is kind of cool uh and so I think it's just a common sense recommendation that the city council used the opportunity of the master planning process to expand the scope a little bit and conduct a feasibility study for solar at the airport well I don't want to engage in green watching I think it does help sell the fact that we are potentially resuming uh commercial critical service there and provides at least some sort of offset to the fact that we're going to be expanding potentially in greenhouse gas emissions here at work and finally uh there's a resiliency component to this because it'd be a we integrate that with a micro grid and battery storage then it's a potential to be able to function uh in a natural disaster situation which I think is one of the real rationales that we have in Salem are having an airport so this is very consistent I did talk to the airport general manager uh who's there okay John uh and he thought that was a very good uh I did also accept the climate change community meeting I think it was favored to be received but I just wanted to go ahead and see if we can get uh the intermoder here of at least some other public body and sale for them and so I would make that motion shall we send a letter thank you do we have a second on that motion second is by Aegis uh conversation just a shout out great job I think this is wonderful proposal and exciting thank you commissioner bottle I'll say the same full support of the idea uh commissioner Slater you also have my social support behind this I think this is very well crafted well thought out um is uh well-timed with uh attempt to bring Commercial Air Service back to the Salem airport and one of the things I appreciate about this approach is that the request is not include and to force it into the project but to request the feasibility um is that diplomatic political Way of Light and shoving which with the right connections City of Salem is both boys for that um addition to the airport that could easily be sourced by funds outside of what's needed to be allocated for bringing internship Air Service back um something that you might be interested to know is that Salem is a test site for micro upgraded Studies by Portland General Electric and they turned their small building over on 16th Street right across from the city maintenance shops into a test site and that is a part of leadership Salem with the Chamber of Commerce I got to go tour that this year and get a presentation about how they're studying microgrids and how they can invest in place to use in communities so there's definitely some support I think in PGE on something like that to add a generation and then you might actually find that fly Salem approved led by the Brandon Park would actually be supportive of this about what it would add to the city as far as the offsets and the electrical transaction cell phone commissioner Augustine aye commissioner Egan commissioner aye commissioner so that concludes um any discussion on item 6.2 uh we move on to seven which is information reports I mean I see none of this listed but I also see visas reaching for the Mike that you might have heard planning administrative support which are not in the groups sorry I was just preparing thank you um upcoming meetings uh on the fly sheet we do have a conference and change and then we're having a presentation on the guild Crest project so I'm doing warranty and the project management um and I don't think we have any items from second June meeting yet which will be the seven I think probably yeah the 27th so that one's still open um which we saw time everybody cases and then we're going to have on July 18th we have a goal library period inventory presentation by our natural resource planners and then we've scheduled three pounds gas inventory report update August 15th and I'm just going to point that out and then um I just want to make sure that there wasn't there aren't any Commissioners that wanted to join us on committee that never responded so this is what I have right now from responses on the Energy Efficiency resilience solar uh subcommittee and commissioner commissioner Slater I'm sure we also got there on that sort of like that okay and then on right period areas natural resources commissioner Heller and commissioner we are going to go okay and then on the community design standards which are class all right do they have a limit of four is that correct that is the correct yes uh well if they'll have me I'm happy to serve all the design center as well then not always welcome I may requests that design standards have a conversation about murals okay I'll send that out an email following this week committee and um so I guess the other seeds you have room that's everything I had thank you I have one question as always this is sorry uh uh these are there any in our tax increment districts our recruitment districts do we have any any resiliency or energy standards would be make grants or other sorts of awards to builders in that area yeah that's a good question I don't know of any but I can ask our our Economic staff and to be more focused on I know downtown they changed it some of your grants providing security um you know we changed um we do and planning and get grants uh for historic um but the hlc added in uh interview um recently we updated our codes to allow me to make it clear that you can do anything solar panels on this sort how someone's just to say like where it needs to be about not be um so we can get that pretty easily um and so we've had a few people and we've kind of wanted to Grant cycle where we cover that now so we've got to do thousands of bad solar panel so you're excited about that but that's a small scale right um so yeah I'll ask and I'll let you know okay thank you just one other question uh never mind so we're at comments under the order contribute yes sorry nobody wants to go a little bit okay try not to eat attend divorce too much um it has to do with the blind science um I do recall that when this first came out I asked about why I couldn't regulate why we just said 60 days and couldn't regularly of a broad signs and in a period that was specific to the with the idea that there was a specific time she could allow for the election they could stay up and have to she had to take a take them down at the time the staff attorney indicated that there was a free speech issues with that and they couldn't be treated differently didn't make sense to me so I did some found out that yeah there are court cases that have said that you can't treat political science different than other signs there are some other countervailing court cases that indicated might be possible and logical to make a case well the 60-day requirement applies to everybody because she got a specific related to the election that you could apply to that however I concluded that while there are a number of cities in Oregon that have someone have that kind of approach that could be challenged it hasn't been but as long as the staff attorney that they did that it wasn't really worth pursuing or trying to do um there's this background history and support the idea to understand what are the staff attorneys have their opinion in fact there was one in large Supreme Court in Washington that made it pretty clear that you couldn't do but I've been talking about doing but what it did then lead me to was to the if that bothers me and I don't know if there's any resolution to it we have these 60-day requirement and it's for non-consecutive safety days which had a single artists related to The Faculty of primary and general elections so that accommodates those periods that we really don't have any other than a right-of-way issue we don't have any of contemporary sovereign because we never know what someone puts it up and it's just a note too it could what it is to reinforce my feeling that the real enforcement we have is but you know I see Jesus saves and black lives matter signs that are up all your life doesn't really bother me I focus on the political science because they always say they come up once and there's on the bottom and that's why we tend to want to regulate that 60 days but I I just come to the conclusion at the end of other than right away we've got a lot sign you know 60 days I started with my own but we really further alongside we just don't really have any way because it's 60-day limit you kind of have to know and we know it so I don't think this is just a reality of it um that it is reinforced and I see everything that's only two way when it comes to the it really forced me to have this thanks for sharing any other comments for good at the order seeing none I will look to the galley no public Insight comment waiting for credits and I will close their eyes",

        "text": " so um we just wanted to flag that as something I would I would appreciate if you could keep an eye on from the council side to make sure that we're in the loop about them moving forward and just aware of it okay okay I will reach out to Robert Chandler after he gets so we at P.S Al I see your hand is up but you're still on mute there um not seeing see there now um my question is that I pass through winter Brown Park the other day and as I do every weekend I met a couple volunteers who were on bikes and they cover a lot of ground there wonderful crew supporting public use of the park one comment was that they are not coordinated among themselves by any effort um from a central office or coordinator and so there is no way to be sure or to try to spread their volunteer hours into areas that are most effective or into Geographic areas that are in most neater what not there's no assurance that every Trail is covered once a week or anything of that sort so I'm hoping that we can find a volunteer coordinator at nor if Amanda sitter is too busy to help do a chart I think what we need really is an app for these volunteers to sign up on that has spaces for all times and trails that's an interactive map of some sort I would like somebody to work on that and but I think some kind of coordination of those volunteers would be helpful now these are volunteers that are keeping an eye on what those there are Trail volunteers that walk the trails or ride bikes through the trails of mental Brown Island Park so is it enforcement is it litter just general keeping an eye on things General keeping an eye on things as far as they know I haven't seen a job description of their entire set of responsibilities but they're basically a presence in the park and Report things that are in need of attention I would presume okay I will be on the side if anyone has any other questions thank you thank you so much councilor Barney appreciate you being here tonight information okay well we can jump right into our board items and presentations I see we have the city manager just joined us city manager Keith Staley we're so excited to have you here I know I've had the chance to talk with you a couple times now but very excited to hear about all these all the updates happening in the city right now with restructuring and the hiring and everything with your Grand Vision so please the floor is yours and look forward to hearing more oh thank you Dylan uh good evening everybody uh Keith Staley city manager uh starting my uh ninth month tomorrow the first day of my ninth month so um it feels like a very short period of time in a very long period of time I'll let the on the same same thought it's like well it's only been eight months and wow it's been eight months and uh it's been a lot uh obviously we're into the budget process now uh that has real meaning for uh our Parks and Recreation uh community and our facilities uh going forward so I hope you're paying attention to that and understand the ramifications there and I'd be happy to respond to any questions you might have about where we are or where we're going with that at your next meeting you certainly can invite the new Deputy city manager uh because he will be on the payroll by then uh he starts on May 22nd so uh uh that is soon um he's coming to us from the city of Camby where he was serving as the community the city administrator there uh but prior to that he was the director of the Clackamas County Parks and Recreation district for a number of years and also was a community development director or Community Services director for the city of Oregon City so uh he comes to us with a tremendous amount of experience and will be overseeing the Parks and Recreation function along with our library department and program our neighborhoods Our Youth Services homeless response or public art program and a few other things uh included there I could say a few more words about myself and where I'm coming from I think that Parks and Recreation are the the foundation of our community and the foundation of our Economic Development activities when you think about what brings quality of life to a community for me it's it's our parks and our Recreation facilities of obviously the city has a great uh infrastructure to build off of uh with you know as Alan was mentioning you know Minto Brown uh certainly When I Was Here interviewing I was blown away by wow uh you know 1200 acre Park uh uh literally you know adjacent to downtown that's a pretty cool asset not a lot of communities have that and uh now in my my home uh back deck of my uh condo looks out over mental Brown Park so I can enjoy it literally every day of the year so pretty pretty cool uh I also live uh at the end of Crestview Drive uh so uh Crestview Drive dead ends into Fairmont Park so I am a frequent uh user of Fairmont Park walking up through the park up to Fairmont neighborhood to go walk the dog and to enjoy the park so I am a Ardent supporter of Parks and Recreation uh and look forward to what our first really significant investment in our personal Recreation facilities in in many years is going to do to our Parks and Recreation programs I mean we're we're investing 28 million dollars from our our public infrastructure Bond into our Parks and Recreation facilities and I just think that's fantastic obviously Scott our new Scott Archer our new Deputy city manager will be responsible for uh help facilitating those and moving those through the development process and implementation process so stay tuned for for that work and you know again going back to the budget conversation uh that's fantastic you know 28 million dollar investment in our Parks and Recreation facilities is fantastic but the reality is it doesn't add any people to maintain those Parks and Recreation facilities and that's really concerning for me and that's why I've proposed the budget that I have uh so that we can maintain the staff that we have and hopefully in the future grow that staff so uh I'll leave it there and be happy to engage with you in conversation wherever you want to take thank you so much that's really helpful appreciate all those updates and it is a very exciting time I am also I think all of us are very excited about the infrastructure Bond and just how quickly that is going to provide just immediate benefits to the park system um I guess a question I would have for you is coming from all of your experience in Olympia um you know are there are there things that you found really effective especially from a Parks I don't know if it's the same Parks and Recreation Advisory board set up in the city there but you know are there ways that you as in your city or in different city manager roles or seeing them work with the community that you think would be good for us to know about or just examples of projects that you you find helpful that we could be doing to support your work yeah I've got a few ideas there uh uh of course uh you know none of them are free so you know always always be careful about that uh Olympia was really fortunate when I got to Olympia I was there for 18 years as the assistant city manager in community development director I was not responsible for Parks and Recreation there I was merely somebody who really enjoyed the facilities and services that were offered by our Parks and Recreation Department but what I saw in 2015 was uh the the City of Olympia the voters there established a metropolitan Parks District uh that set the Olympia Parks and Recreation Department on a trajectory to become a an extraordinary uh uh engine of community well-being and economic development and vibrancy for the community uh when I got there in 2005 the Parks and Recreation Department was really starved uh uh they were struggling both from a maintenance perspective and adding new new facilities and uh in 2015 when the Parks when the Metropolitan Parks District went into effect it essentially added five million dollars to their budget and the impact was extraordinary I mean you know literally extraordinary the things that they've been able to do and the facilities and land that they've been able to add as a result of that are extraordinary so you know funding obviously matters so you know where where we put my our money is where our priorities are and uh you know I hope that we can continue to invest in our Parks and Recreation facilities going forward uh but I guess the other thing that I would would hope that we can think about is the relationship between Parks and Recreation facilities and the connective tissue of the city that our transportation facilities and allowing people to bike and and walk safely in our community so I think as we move forward again with the public infrastructure Bond it's important for us to be looking at how are we accessing uh with you know our sidewalks and trails in this community how can we grow that infrastructure and connect it to our parks and recreation facility so that even more people can access them without having to get in a car and you know drive down or or whatever the case may be so I think there's a a really important opportunity there and the one thing that I see missing in in Salem's sort of you know Community infrastructure is some sort of bike pad advisory committee and I'm not sure if you know Parks and Recreation board is the right board for that or or if that's a separate board but at some point as we get into this I would love to see a a bike pad uh committee that was helping us identify those friction points and helping us you know manage manage our public infrastructure bond from a bike and pet perspective I think there's there's a lot of potential benefit there but uh I am I see Rob's on here uh we recently made a uh an application for a grant uh uh through BPA uh uh Vaudeville power Administration uh for a conservation funding project to purchase around 400 Acres over on the west side of the Willamette River just south of uh Wallace Marine Park what an extraordinary opportunity you know I have no idea you know how that bond is ultimately going to play out but uh if we're successful there and and Rob and and his team Jen and and you know the folks in parks and rec and and Public Works can negotiate that deal what an extraordinary addition to our parks to have both on the east side and west side you know on the on the west side we would then have you know well over 500",

        "text": " overall land use pattern of the area um the hearing officer concluded that um the uh site certificate application was um consistent uh with the land you stand it here the anchorage on which the facility would be placed um as non-arable and does not have water rights um more specifically um would in order to make it a better quality farmland would require water um and that um the ability to obtain a water right um would need to come through transfer that the ability to obtain that is speculative and then finally that the project area um here comprises a small fraction of the total land within lake county that's within pharmus so once again as with all these i've taken a look at the hearing officer's reasoning and and believe that they are supported by the facts in the law so i'll stop and ask if there are any questions um and uh if there aren't then we can move on to the straw poll on this one so jesse the overall land use pattern of the area is part of this issue also isn't it yes that's correct yes and in order to address that then they did the acreage calculations of how much land was in farm use and in what percentage um this represented a third of a percent of private land yeah so the area is the whole county yes that's um the what was looked at here um and you know um there are other ways to look at this issue um but the county unit is useful in some ways at least because there is a reasonable amount of data to look at in terms of that unit and then again the the determination was based both on that fraction and um and the overall quality of the land is zoned here that would be used for the project um and and particularly this conclusion that without water rights um on the property that uh you were not going to be able to use it for a good quality farmland yeah i think i think the water rights fact is pretty significant in this case given that there are circles on the adjacent lands that's all the questions i have i'm ready for the straw poll anyone else here again um i'll just ask whether or not any member of the council objects to the hearing officer's conclusion that the applicant had satisfied the land use standard on this for the reasons that i just stated okay hearing none we will go on to issue issue three is again related to impacts to neighboring farms of the facility as asserted by the the issue reads whether the application failed to demonstrate the proposed development will not unduly diminish agriculture from impacts of fugitive dust invasive weeds wildlife displacement caused by the removal of native vegetation as well as heat blooms unduly increased related public service in violation of part of the lake county zoning ordinance a comprehensive plan goal so there are two kind of sub components to this issue um the first being the um unduly diminishing agriculture component and the second unduly increasing public service costs and so the hearing officer's conclusion here was that county plan uh comprehensive plan goal implemented through two zoning ordinance application had again as condition demonstrated that the proposed facility would comply with both of those provisions um again diving into that a little bit more deeply the um hearing officer concluded that uh protestants had not provided evidence that the farm use impacts alleged by the protestants were likely to occur um and again that they did not either account for required mitigation um or assume that they would fail um uh specifically with respect to crop depredation by elk the alj found that the required mitigation measures were that there had been extensive work with the department of fish and wildlife and that the mitigation measures that were developed as a result of that were um the hearing officers rationale with respect to the public services was essentially identical that um the app the protestants hadn't provided um that the impacts they alleged were likely to occur um so i'll stop there on that one and see if there are any questions jesse this is cindy i don't know if you can see me a question i i there's nothing with respect to this particularly but i am a little bit concerned um as i went through all of these it seems to me hard on the front end and the mitigation factors the conditions are you know go a long way i think but clearly the limited parties are about what happens in the future and i don't know enough about the process so the site goes through and what the limited parties maintain or suggest in the contested case if it um if there is damage from elk or dust or whatever what's the remedy what is the remedy for that yes uh thank you for the question uh councilmember conan so the remedy for any violation of a site certificate condition there are enforcement provisions both in the council statutes and the council's rules um and so um a you know protestant here or wouldn't even need to be a protestant here it could simply be an interested member of the public um can raise an issue with department staff say explain why they believe that a particular site certificate condition is being violated staff will then look into that issue um and respond accordingly there are provisions for penalties to be imposed or remedy requirements to be you know a violation of a site certificate condition is established one other thing that i'd like to point out here for for everyone who's attending this as well is that um f sex site certificates are of both its own standards and other agency permits if the site certificate violation deals with another agency's permit the member of the public might be contacting both the permitting agency and the department staff and then how that is sorted out between the two agencies is really kind of a matter for to decide um there have been you know discussions in the past um with various permitting agencies and and department staff about how that works precisely uh but from the the public's perspective they don't have to worry about all that kind of internal it's just more saying well this looks like it was a removal fill violation so i'm going to give the department of state lands a call and then i'm going to give the citing staff a call and let them know what happened and then those agencies will carry it from there so just a follow-up to make sure i understand it um just as we've heard about another issue or an issue similar to this with respect to another project so the public their point of contact is the council the council issued the site certificate so something happens that counts the council of the department is the first at you know pick up the call or pick up the phone and call or email or whatever and can we take it from there thank you any other questions okay then i will move on to the straw question here again and to ask whether or not any council member has any objections to the way that the hearing officer disposed of this issue concluding that the applicant had met the uh the land use standard with respect um to this issue as a result of the protestants um not providing evidence um that the impacts alleged were likely to occur okay hearing none we will move on to issue four uh so this issue again has to do with farm use impacts but um it's a little different in nature here because it's looking at an exception goal three of the statewide planning goals and also the lake county's comprehensive plan goal three which identifies a preference for the preservation of agricultural land um and so getting into the weeds in terms of um the the different acreage standards for solar facilities um suffice it to say that the applicant and the department both identified that a goal exception would be required for this facility as a result the applicant requested a goal exception focus of the contested case proceeding on this issue had to do with the reasons that the applicant presented so the um goal three exceptions process is sometimes referred to as a reasons um there's actually more to it than that there are several different components that need to be met to take an exception but again the contested case was primarily primarily focused on the validity of the the applicant presented a number of different reasons proposed order had narrowed those down from the department staff's perspective to look primarily at the the minimal nature of the impacts on agriculture as again conditioned in the site certificate local economic benefits hearing officer's order agreed with the department's conclusion the hearing officer appeared to incorporate each of the reasons given by the applicant and so the hearing officers proposed contested case order decision is is a little bit more expansive in terms of um the reasons that uh that he believed were supported by the evidence so um one of the decisions for the council here is what to do about that that potential discrepancy um when we get to the review of the draft final order um the way that i've suggested this is not the only way of dealing with this but the way that i've suggested dealing with this is um acknowledging the discrepancy given that both the proposed order and the proposed contested case order found that there were sufficient reasons that the the difference in rationale here is is immaterial to the overall decision of whether or not to um grant a site certificate um so the outcome is the same either way um draft final order um it's all discussed later still acknowledges the staff's approach um to the goal three exception and the reasons so that's not erased from the draft final order um it's more just you know putting the two of them side by side the hearing officer's the staff's rationale um and saying that you know that the conclusion reached is the same and i as i understand that this has been um you know the nature of reasons for these applications has been a focus of the council in the recent i'm happy to answer any questions about the hearing officer's rationale at this point and as we get into the draft final of course i'm happy to to answer any questions or about the approach that i've suggested or talk about other approaches as well marcy this is hanley jesse um yes we have had conversations about what is adequate for um a goal three exceptions um and i think this application was submitted in uh um our discussions have been more recently than that um and so it's hard you know it's difficult for the applicant to have addressed our issues i do think that the requirement for reasons justifying why the state body state policy embodied and the applicable goals should not apply needed or could use additional in the exceptions process but i do believe that because of the low value of agricultural productivity for the site and the fact that it does not have irrigation water available goes a long way towards meeting that that is part of the justification",

        "text": " needs and out of that conversation was this idea that maybe the state of Oregon needed a road map much like other states who are facing offshore wind development to identify what those values interests and needs are and potentially recommend some standards that could then provide direction to the state toward the development or or amendment of our existing enforceable policies so the idea there would be that dlcd would lead a broad engagement effort a big table approach bringing in many different communities of place and practice and having those conversations over the next year or so and with the hopes uh or the expectation to H produce a roadmap document by about September of 2025 simultaneously dlcd would be evaluating the enforceable policies that are currently on the books and holding those against what we expect the effects to Coastal uses and resources might be and what we're hearing out of the road map conversations to identify where we may have some current gaps or where we may have an opportunity to strengthen or or adjust the policies that we currently have on the books to make sure that they are fit to the challenge that offshore wind could bring and my last slide just to to pictorially show how we see that roadmap process fitting in between now and say five years from now as I mentioned that road map would take about a year year and a half uh built on a lot of Engagement and containing strategy language and proposed standards but then could be taken and formalized Via subsequent processes be they agency rulle makings amendments to the territorial plan local plan and code amendments or even to the level of statutes in the next legislative session uh to then create those enforceable policies and we we're expecting that we would have time to complete all of this before we would actually see that first construction and operations plan for an offshore wind project so we recognize that offshore wind is coming we recognize that there's going to be a a substantial challenge to the state to to evaluate that against our standards and we want to rise to that challenge and make sure that that we're ready for reviews thank you that I'll take any questions thank you any questions for Jeff before we um to our next presenter Jason well it certainly seems like a complex undertaking so I really appreciate how much attention the um governor's office and the agencies are putting in a and interest groups and tribes uh and others are putting into trying to think about how to how to do a good job of evaluating the process C thank thank you uh Kathy um yeah well first of all Jeff I want to thank you for that very clear presentation and um thank you for all the work that you did informing us on you know uh about uh house spill 4080 at the time was very very helpful I think I stole some of your words in my floor carry um so please forgive but thank you um it you know one one of the questions that has come up is um you know if the projects are able to go forward um what what do we do as a state to make sure that the electricity doesn't just get sent down to California uh but comes to us in Oregon um and that may well require us to come up with some transmission infrastructure and how how does that all fit into your planning um I there will have to be a parallel process there that will involve EPC and uh everything that we heard about before um what kind of thinking is going into that well that's probably a question better directed at Jason who's who's following here but I will say that the the road map Bill contained language uh that was specifically requesting this road map group to evaluate standards that relate to energy resiliency reliability and so there may be some opportunities there if we determine that that that we're lacking in certain policies that we could apply that there may be an opportunity there but I would defer to Jason for great conversation there any other questions for Jeff great let's go ahead and turn things over to Jason great thanks everybody um is somebody running the slides and I just say next there we go okay perfect um and I think I'll just stay off camera it might be easier that way um but I'll try to get through this it's short shorter than Jeff's I will touch on transmission a little bit but maybe um save your questions for the end and then we can talk about transmission there um but you know if something Rises to the occasion feel free to interject and and jump in with a question as I go through the slides here uh next so yeah we can jump to this map here this is something um that um pretty much covered I would say the bone process so next slide and again Jeff talked about this one um the house bill 480 Road mapping um effort is kind of the big takeaway from from that bill it did do some other things Jeff did a good job summarizing I think everything there um the flag here from odo's perspective is highlighting uh one of the provision in that bill that was dedicated to the energy aspects of offshore wind and so this will be kind of how the department engages in that road mapping effort um you know giving input on the achievement of State energy and climate policies you know how offshore wind might be a value for increasing um energy diversity reliability and resilience of the state and Regional power grid um flag the due dates for that that are also similar to um our state energy strategy which I'll talk about on the next slide so next slide um you remember that September 1st deadline of next year so our state energy strategy deadline is also similar so I think the thought would be for these two processes to um inform each other as best they can to the extent they can um and so this is our snapshot slide on the state energy strategy which most people probably have heard a little bit about um so in 2023 the legislature passed House Bill 3630 that gave us this Authority um so a year before the recent Asher wind Road Road mapping bill passed um this past and this is kind of like simple way to think of it is just all the Energy Technologies you know and maybe use the word road map even though it's called a strategy you know kind of a similar tact um basically we are charged with um you know leading an engagement input Gathering process with the diverse group of interested parties and that would include tribes communities state agencies you know kind of pretty much everybody under the big tent to develop a state energy strategy to identify Pathways um for achieving the state's energy and climate policy goals um so the scope of this would assess many types of energy Technologies not just offshore wind so you'll get you know Energy Efficiency transmission solar batteries the whole gamut is going to be assessed under the state energy strategy um and the goal is to provide kind of a high level strategic guidance for the state um help identify implementation gaps and options to achieve the energy and climate goals explore technology and policy Pathways and uh seeks to identify a preferred pathway um potentially that transparency balance transparently balances all these trade-offs that we hear so much about you know what when in terms of land use and resource um qualities and different things like that so um like I said the timelines are similar so we'll try to stay keep these two processes connected um next is um a little bit about um so my last two slides are actually more on the energy sector side of offshore wind and showing folks you know what are the other activities whether the state level or the power planning power sector world like with utilities what are these other activities going on that are relating to Offshore wind off Oregon's Coast so this one is with um speaking a little bit about the Oregon Utility Commission Public Utility Commission and what it does with our utilities and their integrated resource plans so what is an IRP that's literally what it is integrated resource planning and that is like a 20-year Outlook that utilities do to forecast the scale and timing of what they need in terms of new resources you know to meet load growth and things like that and to identify potential candidate Technologies to fill those needs um these irps they're continuously updated essentially they're on twoyear Cycles so as soon as one is kind of submitted to the Pu um their review process begins and that takes a while and then shortly after the utility is kind of onto their next IRP like doing the early early work on that and so it's kind of a continuous refresh basically of these evaluations um and so what that means is what's identified in the utility IRP one year may not match with what's identified in the sub subsequent IRP these things can change based on market conditions and a host of other factors weather conditions all sorts of things um so for example a significant change in forecasted load growth or a rapid cost decline from an emerging technology could cause the utilities IRP um to change and the resource mix to change from one cycle to the next um and maybe I said this already but the Public Utility Commission reviews these um and these are the Nexus is really just with our investor owned utilities they have the regulatory authority over our investor our investor owned utilities that serve oregonians and the point is to um acknowledge whether these plans are reasonable that's the the point of the review process um and the 2023 three irps for both Oregon's two largest utilities PGE and pacificor are are nearing the end of this review process um the 2023 irps are the first to include assessments of the new resources PG impact need to meet Oregon's 100% clean energy goals so that legislation House Bill 2021 passed in 2021 and so these irps that were submitted around this time last year um in 2023 um were the first go around and the first pass at incorporating um the 100% clean energy targets so these are important irps um the puc is closing up their their review processes on them they haven't issued their final orders but those are forthcoming um and the whole reason I'm flagging these is because um there were discussions that kind of either talked about offshore wind on the on the outskirts or we're directly talking about offshore wind um so for people who are interest in this topic I wanted to flag this um as an opportunity you know to learn more about what the utilities are planning for in terms of offshore wind um in those discussions just high level they were you know the discussions with the Pu and our utilities were around all these challenges to meeting ",

the applicant provided evidence in the form of a letter from an FC evaluated and pre-approved financial institution specifically Wells Fargo Bank um to support their ability to receive an adequate Bond or letter of credit the letter from Wells Fargo Bank indicates that nextera energy Capital Holdings Incorporated has a revolving uh credit and letter of credit uh in the aggregate amount of just under $4.3 billion which um is greater than what uh the department recommended Council find to be the total adjusted cost estimate including AO contingencies and applicant contingencies for this facility which would be 30 183 and that that total amount which is bold on that se and the third bullet uh is what the department recommended Council find to be a reasonable estimate um to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition next slide please for the fish and wildlife habitat standard um this requires Council to find that the design construction and operation of a facility is consistent with the Oregon Department of Fish and wildlife's habitat mitigation goals and standards and at this proposed facility at Wagon Trail um the facility would permanently disturb approximately 7 Acres of Category 3 habitat specifically native perennial grassland and 3,667 point9 Acres of category 6 Dryland wheat and other developed habitat so the vast majority is disturbance to cat six habitat only seven acres would be to cat three um there would be 7.1 approximately 7.1 Acres of temporary habitat uh impacts and that those temporary habitat impacts would be to cat categories 2 three four and five with the majority six and a half of the 7.1 being the cat three um and and as a result oh let's see actually you want to go to the next slide please om this is a a figure that's representative of the habitat types and you can see it's it's mostly all the Dryland wheat which is that orange color and then the very next slide two um is the habitat category within the analysis area next slide please and the Orange is cat six and you can see in within the analysis area there is other C habitat categories but um very little actual uh variation within the site boundary that would be impacted just 7 Acres of cat 3 a disturbance um and permanent habitat impacts would be mitigated through off-site mitigation and that identification and improval and approval of a habitat area um and the implementation of enhancement actions at said habitat mitigation area uh would be finalized in a habitat mitigation plan okay next slide please for threaten thre an endangered species the applicant evaluated compliance with council's threatened and endangered species through desktop and field surveys in consultation with ODFW and the Oregon Department of Agriculture and based on this these uh they determine that there's suitable habitat for six State threatened endangered and candidate species one mammal and five plants um with with that there were only two um that were known to occur within the analysis area the Washington ground squirrel and Lawrence's milk bch um in DPO the department recommends conditions that would require preconstruction surveying flagging and measures to ensure avoidance of these species next slide please for the Wildfire prevention and risk mitigation standard this requires Council toine that the applicant has adequately characterized Wildfire risk associated with the facility um he would be operated in compliance with council approv with a council approved Wildfire mitigation plan the applicants evaluation found that the Baseline Wildfire risk within the site boundary is primarily low but has areas of high risk and in the deepo the department recommends Council find that the Wildfire risk within the analysis area to be low except for areas along Agricultural and residential areas um and transmission line and transportation corridors where the Wildfire risk would be moderate um and in the DPO the department recommends conditions that would require the Drafting finalization and implementation of both a construction Wildfire mitigation plan and an operational Wildfire mitigation plan councelor R thank you um Chas does this mean that um that it would be pre Construction that those two plans would be required before well there would be a yeah a precon a precon the construction Wildfire mitigation plan would need to be finalized prior to construction and the operational um would be prior to operation I just know that um the same company was just awarded at Wheat Ridge East and there were some um updates to that um welfare mitigation conditions and whatnot and just wondered if those match up to this one they do okay yeah yes and then um this also brought up another thought has the department um looked any looked further into having odf come and and bring a presentation to the council and also I believe they are working on um a newer data report and so um as far as you know fire risk throughout the state so just wondered if there's any followup on that thank you secretary cornette the record Todd cornette um thank you council member IMS we are in the process of um looking to determine when the best time to do an agenda item we have it kind of on the list uh exactly what the month is we're not sure yet um and what that will constitute but the the basic idea is sort of an evaluation of the Wildfire standard you know what's going on currently you know out there you know in the world with you know the Public Utility Commission the organ Department of Forestry others um and so we don't have anything definitive yet it's definitely on our list we've been talking about it uh but don't have anything exactly planned yet um but we will do you guys happen to have you heard anything about um where they're at and their um as far as their new data and their new report that they're working on have you heard any information on that because I looked on the website and I couldn't find yeah we've been talking about it I'm not sure to be honest um so I don't know exactly what's going on this is a fairly Dynamic area right now you know obviously there's been increased wildfires some related to transmission the Public Utility Commission the utilities the you know Department of Forestry and not just Oregon you know all over you know the western states as well so there's a lot going on with this and you know we will try to get our hands around as much as we can when we bring that up to you know council with that agenda item in the near future but it will be in the near future okay thank you okay next slide Nancy or om next slide please okay this is my last standard to go through and this is um the noise control regulations for uh deq's noise control regulations are noise standard um and for in the DPO um well the operational noise from the proposed facility W was evaluated to the maximum allowable noise limits construction noise um is uh exraction noise what's the word is exraction in well operational noise was what was evaluated um and the noise sources used in the noise modeling evaluation during operations were the battery storage heating ventilating and air conditioning units the electrical components step up Transformers main power transformer at The Collector substation and the transmission line in their evaluation the applicant um identified 33 noise sensitive resp ctors the applicants noise modeling uh results showed that um the proposed facility operation would exceed the maximum allowable standard uh at seven noise sensitive receptors at nighttime and at four noise receptors um within the analysis area and so in the DPO the department recommends that Council find that that the facility as proposed would not comply with the requirements um with the DEQ noise regulations um without additional mitigation and as such the department uh recommended a condition that or conditions that would require the applicant to provide the department with information that identifies a final location to be built um be it in phases or all at once as well as the maximum sound power level for the facility components um and the results of the noise analysis of the final facility design performed in a manner consistent with the requirements of Oar o35 which is the DEQ regulations and this analysis this additional analysis that would be conditioned in would have to show that they would be meeting the ambient noise degreg standard and would not be exceeding the maximum allowable noise standard so although their their uh modeling results showed that they wouldn't meet it we're conditioning that they have to meet it prior to Construction berer so this is something that we as the council would delegate to the department to ensure that this standard is ultimately met even if we make a finding that as proposed it's not met I'm a little queasy about that but I think there's a work around I'm just not sure what it is so thank you okay well um that's I believe that's it with my presentation if there's additional um guidance on what you'd like to do going forward and if if there's addition standards you'd like reviewed or uh I'm all I'm yours this is Kent I've got one uh question that I should have brought up before we jumped to Wildfire and it was uh regarding the goal five uh area and just wanted to make sure that there's not any um historic recreational or Wetlands or Waters of the state that fall under go five I'm not sure off the top of my head but I can okay look into it and get back to you yeah I didn't see it but I just you can get back to me it be fine okay so sh yeah Castor buer so I think based on our discussion we probably want to spend time at the next meeting um looking at the goal three exception and any recommendations staff has as to making those particular findings um just because we we want to get that right um I think it would also I speaking for myself be helpful to look at how the soil stabilization and we control plans align because I don't know if those sometimes go at Cross purposes but um just just to make sure we're setting clear expectations there I mean I am not a soil scientist or a weed person but um it just seems like we could be working uh across purposes and um um but really spending some time on the goal three bet thank you chair how there's no gold five resources other than I think maybe there might be Washington ground squirrel or Lawrence vetch that that kind of stuff but that can be we can deal with that conditions just an observation as as we go back to the goal three exceptions I think lining out those findings that oh we don't have G five",

        "text": " our community is reflected in our day-to-day operations at Washington County any other thanks continue okay thank you so I'll move on to um Animal Services um which um again is also there's a 5% um reduction proposed this reduction will be offset with additional dog license fees so the reduction is about $89,000 um we're we um will offset that with 50 53,000 um 400 in dog license fees and then we'll also transfer 35,0 660 from our gifts and donation fund so those those um reductions will be covered a significant funding source for um Animal Services is the dog license fees and and um there are no significant changes proposed to the fees because our fees remain comparable or high higher than our neighboring counties including maltoma and Clackamus County and we don't have a cat licensing fee correct we have we don't have a cat licensing requirement in Washington just pointing that out thank you yes thank you okay um on to Health and Human Services Administration the budget decision package reductions um continue to be impactful for the program staff the the um reduced um funding and training um supplies and Professional Services strains the ability to build skills increase knowledge and deepen engagement for our staff the current reductions um that are proposed um we worry may increase risk of turnover and again this is um as um uh Miss Angie pointed out I think this is a theme you're going to hear throughout related to um really wanting to support our staff in their um career and um support those training and education and other opportunities the other um impact is that um most of the reduction was taken under um line item called special expenditures and that in includes community-based organizational sponsorships um these sponsorships are really critical um for our community-based partners whom we rely on as trusted Community Partners to help us meet our missions So within Health and Human Services we can't do it alone we need many many many community- based Partners um and other stakeholders to help us meet that mission and then finally um as I mentioned before um there was a reduction in disability agent and Veterans um of one FTE whose services are now fully integrated into housing into the Housing Services Department the proposed budget also includes other Division and program reductions um which overall have minimal impact on our services so um now I'd like to um go through just a few um Department highlights that we're proud of um and want to make sure are on your radar within Health and Human Services so I'm going to start with um the center for addiction treatment and triage which we um often refer to as cat beginning in 2019 Washington County Behavioral Health embarked on initiative on an initiative to increase access to substance Ed disorder treatment for our community members the project was developed through extensive Community engagement with over 230 people providing input for this project nearly half of those individuals identified as having lived experience with substance use disorder the project will add culturally specific outpatient treat treatment Residential Treatment withdrawal management sobering peer drop in services and a v a variety of other collocated services such as an on-site Pharmacy and access to Supportive Services it will add 86 impatient beds and many other outpatient services within our community we're we are partnering with our Supportive Housing Services HHS is partnering within their um Supportive Housing Services Program to ensure that community members with housing instability can be connected to resources and services through the Housing Services System the estimated Capital cost of the two campus model um is 63,800 which are now fully funded without any general fund contribution the the two site names have recently been approved by the board of County Commissioners thank you the site names will be under the umbrella of the program name which is the center for addiction triage triage and treatment and the two sites will help our communities locate needed Services by calling them the Hillsboro Recovery Center and the Beaverton Recovery Center so one site is um the old um emergency um communic ation building the old wacka building um in um Beaverton and then the other site is um Elum young um right off the Max on Elum young in Hillsboro after a successful legislative short session the capital costs are now fully funded and we're able to begin site development operating costs for the services we often get asked about those will be funded through Medicaid grants and other Insurance um Services we do not anticipate needing um County general fund to build or operate these critical um services and I I also want to add that this would not have happened without um the the championship support that we've received from our board from day one back in 2019 when this was just a a tiny little bubble in our heads within Health and Human Service Services just an idea and we were given the support that allowed us to carry on and do the community work and we're getting very very near to um implementing these services so it's very exciting for us so um next I'll talk a little bit about animal services again um the the Washington County Animal Services um is located at the Bonnie Hayes animal shelter in Hillsboro it's right on TV Highway we offer a variety of resources and services to help our community live safely and happily with pets the total number in the past fiscal year the animal services answered 67700 plus phone calls from the public 7144 field responses for Animal Welfare Public Safety and pets people compatibility concern concerns this was this is the initial um call number the 7100 it doesn't include the number of followups and um revisits um and or total contacts as we're investigating um some of these animal concerns in a in addition um we're happy to say that 3574 live animals were taken in a stray injured neglected abused and that we were able to return most of those to their owners we we are um known as a no kill shelter which means we don't euthanize um animals unless it's uh a situation that's um very dangerous or very the the animal is so sick or injured just like in most of us would choose to euthanize a pet in those so um 1 1700 of the an sorry 1700 of the animals were returned to their owners 1365 were transferred out for adoption to places like the Humane Society thank you Marty I was just going to ask um do we account for the volunteer hours at the um through Animal Services it's just at the volunteer night I was surprised that at the number of people that were there and I think my awareness of volunteer hours really grew yeah yeah thank you um I I don't have that on the top of my um just adding it as a good yes absolutely we rely on volunteers and we have a very robust um volunteer program and the animals are better cared for because of those volunteers so thank you for raising that and it's a shout out for that help to yes absolutely so Animal Services you'll see in the budget is designating $60,000 in um FY 2425 as an expense to support anticipated costs um related to determining a scope the scope of a new animal shelter project this would include hiring Consultants as we move forward with efforts efforts to determine the best way to provide a new facility that will meet current and Future needs um of Washington County residents um including ability to take in the Stray animals for housing um robust adoption services public and animal safety enforcement and Community Services related to education training and disaster recovery so we would love to have a space for those volunteers and others to learn more about the care needed for the animals and um for um desire Disaster Response so um many of you probably know with the the fires I'm trying to remember that was two two ago yes that um the there was a CO yeah a part A partnership between um the county fair Westside Commons as well as animal services so that we could house um large animals so they um get together mobilized so that we can help transport those animals and care for those animals so that's just an example of the importance of those training programs um these amounts are not going to impact any general fund contribution to um Animal Services um and I will say um because you'll hear later about the um the um o my mind just went blank you'll hear um more about our Capital Improvement projects and just some reassurance that this project is within that um thank uh Capital Improvement program and projects will be discussed tomorrow um so why are we looking at this a few years ago um we had a county audit um that where it was determined that our current animal shelter is inadequate the audit report um really highlighted results that restrict the number of animals that were able to hold in the shelter and also restricts the length of time um animals should not be held more than a two week maximum the current shelter is crowded for both the public and staff and has frequent maintenance issues after the audit the board agreed that we should start identif find what we would need in a new animal shelter and how we might pay for that animal shelter several steps have been taken already including completion of an animal shelter facility facility needs assessment and we have gathered data and um developed that that show the size and scope of an ideal facility we are in the process of completing a fundraising feasibility study that will help us to determine the potential of successful um fundraising campaign towards that Capital as well questions about animal no I just want to um underscore one um point that Marne had made um a capital fundraising strategy we do not have dollars set aside or dollars identified for a new shelter while we know this is a need so hence the importance of determination of a fundraising opportunity to um move forward with the need needed facility I have a question about that is this for an additional site or replacement of the Bonnie Hayes animal shelter thank you for that question um I think that's part of the um the contract that we're looking at with some Consultants to look at and and working with our own facilities team um to determine you know what's the best approach is it a completely new um um site um and shelter or is it modification um we are constrained by the the um property size um of the shelter thank you for that question I I have a quick question too so Oregon Humane Society just went through a huge um Improvement of their facilities with the behavioral center and the vill taking large dog intakes um uh the hospital there which they uh connect with um uh not bfield Oregon State University yeah um and it's a lot of money and hu",

        "text": "all right so everyone I'm Christy stevington I work with Hagerty Consulting I'm helping the Oregon Department of energy put on this event today so just to kind of give you a quick background on what this is um I think many of you have participated in some of these feedback sessions in the past but we're here to kind of discuss some of the changes and updates that have been made to the program narrative that was submitted to the U.S department of energy but there are still some areas of this program that we're looking to refine notably the selection tier that we'll be using to kind of Spore some of these programs so we're going to go through a couple of areas for feedback and review and we're hoping to get a really good discussion both virtually and in person and so we're going to try to also help moderate and make sure that if there are questions in the chat or comments that we're kind of addressing both of these simultaneously so we may have to interject in person to make sure that virtually people can participate as well so just know to expect that um and I think we can move the next slide team and just kind of run over some of the agendas and objectives today so I think I covered some of this but just to give you a quick overview of what this will look like we'll do the welcome and introductions we'll do a very brief for anyone who hasn't been part of these sessions before very brief kind of overview of the iija infrastructure investment and jobs act and this particular 401 or 1D funding we'll also do the overview of the process kind of what the submitted program narrative looked like what changes were made based on feedback we've received and then kind of looking forward what we're still looking to get from back on notably the competitive review process minimum application requirements and then Community benefit as well we do have some other information that's available today that you might be interested in but if we get to that if there's time we'll certainly do it but we will have these slides available for everyone afterwards just in case and I think we can go to the next slide all right so for virtual participants and I just want to make sure I hit all of the important points on this um we do have a comment section we want to make this as inclusive as possible I think I mentioned that already so for anyone who's virtual if you have comments please feel free to put them in the chat um if you raise your hand we'll have both someone from photo and someone from 580 kind of monitoring to make sure those questions either get answered in real time or we'll bring you up we need to contribute to the conversation as well so that's going to be watching for um and I know Bryson is on he will be helping us moderate and kind of helping you to direct sort of where to do what in terms of raising your hand and making sure that your voice gets spurred so thank you can we do a soundtrack online can you hear Katie in the room okay yeah I hear I see nods okay okay fantastic all right and yes if there's at any point if we Fade Out or if there is challenges with tech just throw something in the chat we will be watching and try to get that resolved in real time all right then I think if there is nothing else we can move along to I believe to Ruchi to kick us off and kind of introduce the day for us yeah um thanks Hagerty um Christy and Katie and Bryson our Consultants really happy that they're here to facilitate today because then we would have to and we really appreciate their help um I just wanted to sort of set the stage and make sure that you are familiar with the Oregon Department of energy this is our mission on the side our department helps oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape and Equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations and then below that is oh you know very short list of all the various divisions and programs and services that we offer at our department kind of rolled up into this list and today we're here to talk about an energy a set of um funding that will create a new program at the agency so that last bullet there with energy program that's that's what we're talking about and that's going to support our ability to have a resilient and affordable Energy System in this state so you can see some really strong connectivity with our mission and our I think we can go to the next slide so this slide is just a list that we put together of some principles after the iija and the infrastructure reduction Act passed we recognize that we would be receiving millions of dollars in funding to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency resilience among other important topics and we held a series of public webinars we had discussions with our energy advisory work group we got feedback online to basically develop these principles as a lens for our overall approach to Federal funding so I won't read all of these but you'll see a focus on Equity including Geographic diversity uh commitment to coordinate with tribal governments where possible providing technical assistance to folks that want to apply for federal funds a recognition that we need to do some cross-agency Partnerships we work really closely with DEQ with ODOT with dlcd and other agencies in the state and we don't want to replicate their expertise we just want to bring them on for the ride and then finally just to you know ensure that we're taking advantage of every high high priority funding opportunity but also ensuring that we have the resources and the ability to have quality work that comes from it and we're making every available daughter dollar go to its best use and so you know this is what we apply to every Federal funding opportunity and hopefully through the Commerce station today you'll see that these very principles are in our discussion today as well but yeah thanks thanks for being here and I'll pass it back to the team so we'd love to do right now just to get a sense of who's in the room as if we could go around and do a quick round robin of introductions with your name your organization what brings you to the session and what you're most interested in getting out of it and then for those virtually if you could answer those questions in the chat we'll go through and read them out loud at the end as so Rob if you don't mind why don't we start with you again sure Rob Del Mar and the senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of energy and I'm actually going to be the one who helps to stand up this program so that's what brings me to the table and the information I would most likes discuss is how we establish selection criteria to be able to identify the highest value projects and program when we launch it I'm Logan Davis I'm a consultant and I'm doing research grant funding for the Warm Springs tribe and I'm just looking to get as much information as I can to good morning everyone I'm Katie toskey with Hagerty Consulting uh hegerty's really honored to be supporting Odo with this initiative and it's privilege to meet all you this morning thank you for being here and I introduced myself already I'm Christy stevington but I am very excited to just be learning more about this funding collecting all of the notes the stakeholder feedback really listening today and I'm trying to incorporate this into uh what the strategy is moving forward as well Andy Fletcher general manager of Columbia based in the library a small Cooperative in eastern Oregon and I'm in the United States in the overall program in what it's going to end up looking like I'm looking for and what the okay good morning everyone I'm gonna ask you one Portland General Electric and the infrastructure program director on charge of all graph funding applications and the project development for PGE I do work with trucks here at Warm Springs on brand applications and also for all of our customers and then just see what the criteria is for these State resilience Michael Lofton controller for Warm Springs Power and Water Enterprises so we're looking at grant funding for various projects on the uh Pelton round view hydroelectric project and with our 100 ownership in the you know re-regulating Dam generating facilities thank you uh Richie severe Oregon Department of I'm the general manager here at Warm Springs power and modern Enterprises so we're really happy to have you here today and um so I'll second what Mike said but we've also um through our Tribal Council we've expanded our vision a bit for this Enterprise this Enterprise is primarily responsible for the utility size efforts but we also are helping the community because of limited resources we have some of those here that we can deploy to get more of the community programs and such so what's my my most interested in discussion discussing is that criteria and just just how do you take advantage of all these opportunities you know are there priorities is there some sort of a holistic effort to help us all keep track of all those so we don't miss any so glad to be here um do we want to do a quick review of Who's online sure uh we have Jessica Rikers from Odo uh Emily salmary from Odo uh Kyle petrostein from uh Energy Trust of Oregon Sarah Buckwalter from Pacific port Joshua bassafin uh from climate Solutions who's interested in understanding what the options are for good resilience projects Lee Elder from Pacific Corps interested in community benefits uh Jennifer Jolly hello Jennifer from the Oregon Municipal Electric utilities um listening in on the conversation for member utilities who are eligible to um Emily Wagoner from Oregon Health she is at the session as power grid issues are of concern to the health and well-being of people in her region Central and Eastern

we will get some of that with the new uh with the new Chief but um but I think there will always be a need to have a partnership uh with uh with at least Mount McDonnell for the next seven years should this be approved and but uh vendors uh of the like great thank you very much other questions okay see no questions who would like to make a motion director Duncan I move the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract with Mott McDonald LLC for project management services for a four-year base term and three one-year contract extensions for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand second we have a motion in a second any seeing no discussion all those in favor please say aye aye aye any opposed I no opposition motion passage unanimously thank you very much next we'll uh hear about the battery electric buses sure and I'll ask our maintenance manager Greg Thompson to please come in an attempt to save paper I'm going to try to marry some technology in my high good luck thank you see how it goes uh good evening president Davidson members of the board tonight I'm asking that the board approves the general manager general manager to execute a contract Amendment with Gilly for the purchase of five 40-foot electric battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed 5 million 386 750 dollars at the so the reason why some of these look familiar is because they are we this is so this approval tonight is kind of a consolidation of some past approvals and some new approvals which is going to be one overarching contract with gillig for the the first five buses so there so as we go through this it'll we have things itemized on the bus costs we're coming with those buses and we'll also show kind of where some of the teachers are so at the April 21st 2021 board meeting approval was awarded awarded for the general manager to enter into a contract with gillig for the purchase of the five buses for amount not to exceed three million 597 775 dollars at the November 18 2021 board meeting approval was given for the purchase of the onboard charging equipment that we added after the fact of the the board approving the bus purchase for an amount not to exceed 395 750 dollars at the time when we were going through those bus purchases our intent was and in our Grant application we were going to lease the batteries that was an option that was available to us and we were going to use the battery cost as the match in the overall Grant since that time there's been some some changes in from the governmental Accounting Standards the Accounting Standards Board a gasb number 87 and it made this leasing batteries less attractive as opposed to purchasing them outright and also since that time the district has received local state Source funds that can be used to purchase the battery so we can offset some of those with the outright purchase essentially we're not going to be carrying that that least debt for a period of 12 Years so that was the the last remaining approval was the the battery issue we were tending to come to the board for the lease now we're including that in the purchase of the buses because I don't even remember the first one we said we kind of joke because we said oh the batteries aren't included on the first five I don't know if you remember that now they're included so the so in table one in your packet we've kind of broken out with the the cost of the bus itself is each bus is one million seventy seven thousand three hundred and fifty dollars five buses brings that bus total to 5 million included in that is the bus itself the onboard Chargers that was earlier approved and that's the inductive pickup charging equipment is on the bus we've added uh is in manager kids presentation he saw an image of the electric bus with the graphics and the wrap so that was an additional additional cost for fourteen thousand six hundred and eighty two dollars a bus the batteries themselves are a hundred and ninety four thousand dollars per bus we've added a battery warranty that will warranty those batteries for a period of six years so that kind of helps mitigate any risk if there's a battery issue or cell issue that we work with Cummins for for that warranty and then we've added two thousand dollars per bus for a total of ten thousand dollars for maintenance training they will purchase some blocks of training from gillig to go over some OEM specific electric bus training that brings the the grand total for that bus for all five at five million three hundred and eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars now of that money is broken out there we're using several different Grant funds in table three kind of starts breaking out in that overall purchase how we're funding that so we're using 53 39c with it has a 75 25 match the ground amount is 2 million seven hundred and twenty seven thousand the or the the grant amount the grant amount is that much the match is nine hundred and nine thousand dollars for a total of three 636 thousand dollars for the the batteries we're using the Oregon D Dash Das for the batteries and the extended warranty that's uh 100 Grant funded for the the total amount of one million three hundred and forty five thousand dollars for that onboard charging equipment we are using 5307 a charging for the charging equipment that's that total for 395 000 750 and then we're using general fund to cover the training costs for ten thousand dollars bringing that total again so you can kind of see it summarized together at five million three eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars and again the approval tonight is just to wrap up one entire gillig contract price if all the expenditures we're going to be spending with Gilly I'm trying to think if I missed anything uh staff recommends that the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract Amendment with gillig for the purchase of five 40-foot battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed 5 million 750 and I am ready for any questions you may have okay any questions any questions for manager Thompson yes thank you um so my understanding is that there's 10 buses total that are supposed to come on the property is that correct great question yes there are there are two orders of five and this is considering the first five the other the other five are they will be entering production the first week of June and will will those batteries be purchased instead of least as well is that the idea correct the the lease program is only available for a very short window and we took it we tried to take advantage of it uh and is only available essentially for that first low no Grant and then come and decided not to do that program any longer so it wasn't even available on our second Grant so those those buses came with thank you and I have one other pet peeve of my my own personal pet peeve though I'll just air for everybody um so what part of this is about graphics and uh is that private vinyl wrap or something like that it is it's a it's a vinyl wrap that we wanted to set apart the the look of the electric buses while still maintaining the the colors of Chariots and have some familiarity we also wanted to set those Vehicles apart Great yeah I think that's fine I I just don't like it when I think disrespectful to our passengers when we have wraps that go over the windows over substantial part of the windows and you've got those little holes to look through I don't I don't personally like that I don't think I don't think it's people want to be able to look out the window or see in the window so you know I that's just one Pepe whoever's designing that I'm sure it's probably you're not the graphic designer so but just to keep as much of those windows as free as possible that's right so Chief Feeney do you know offhand does the proposed graphic cover the windows full wrap might cover the windows but the otherwise we were doing partial reps which would not so we were gonna have a full-size bus year round that was going to have the full size wrap and then the other buses would be partial that was just one bus just the one bus I share a similar yeah pet peeves other questions the Oregon dasque fun source is that the end of the Betsy tack credit stuff the very end we never have to wow congratulations so let's verify does that exhaust all the the no we have more there's still more okay still it's a good thing okay I mean that is wonderful it's just real money now real money it is wonderful to see it being invested in things that actually mean something to our community I'm so happy other questions I will entertain a motion I move the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract Amendment with gillig for the purchase of five 40-foot battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed five million three hundred and eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars a second second we have a motion and a second any discussion director Duncan I know that part of the reason we do this is because there are Grant funds but also I am always impressed by how you are able to find so much grant funding and how we take advantage of it in such a fantastic way I know how hard it is to get and maintain grants and I just want to say once more how much I appreciate the work that you guys do to maintain our budget to the best of our ability and to do the most with what we have so thank you thank you we have a outstanding finance department that they work magic for me other discussion I'll just I I feel compelled to say that I'm unsurprisingly very excited about this I'm excited for the battery electric buses that's not what I'm actually saying but I I wanted to say that I'm very excited for this pilot I have every expectation and hope that this succeeds that this is a wonderful success but I also want to State publicly that this could fail and it's okay Pilots fail and that I want to State here on the record that if it does fail or if there are more challenges than we",

        "text": " I think um and that also uh well not and that kind of like wraps it up for him but then he also in his history like he has formed the area um he has limited water rights and the concept of applying it to where it would be the most beneficial um and then they also provide the testimony of uh Declaration of Steve Scott who is the land owner of the uh subject tracked uh two and so he's the gentleman that went out there and and tried to farm that land and he tried to do Dryland wheat on the um and so his testimony reflects his efforts now what it does do which we talked a little bit some at the DPO hearing but it kind of gives metrics and and and data to evidence and support you know his his words um which is he he basically says how much how many how much they were able to yield in 2013 and 2015 and then he gives an estimate of how much revenue they made and then he also talks about how much how much the costs were to to actually do the farming and then it turns out that it is it's a a loss of about eight thousand dollars and so when we're talking about AG I mean it has to be to to be somewhat profitable for somebody to affirm it um so and what the applicant also provided was evidence that um from the USDA that shows how much like average um bushels per acre um which demonstrates that what he was yielding was pretty way below what the average would be a bushel per acre and so the and then the question the questioning at the DPO hearing was about then went into well what if you could you know get water rights can you get water rights on there um to which the applicant has um at the hearing they provided a map that indicated that the subject properties are in the Stage Gulch water oh area I might be uh saying that anyways the stage I don't know if it's a water conservation a critical area of conservation so they provided a map but then um in their supplemental materials they also provided the the um the final order indicating here I'll just go there final here we go the final order before water resource department and the matter of the determination of critical groundwater area in the Stage Gulch area Umatilla County this is the area where the subject tracks are um this is the final order that says because this is related to like well water for for AG and again paraphrasing it says no more water and those areas are in there so that kind of shuts down being able for groundwater um and then the the applicant also provided this attachment three they provided this at the hearing and then re-submitted it in their supplemental information I don't know how much this managers but for record purposes because it's a really these are really lengthy documents um I've Consolidated the record only with one um because functionally this does get attached to the DPO so um we love Burgers so they provided this uh copy of the landowner's notice of the East improvement district which is an Irrigation District and what the applicant highlights is that the two tax laws for the subject tracks are not included in this East improvement um and but those Parcels that are art priors this is also to back up our prior it um are included in it and were recently included which Pence is his irrigation so also in the Department's agency consultation with Oregon water resource department we you know functionally asked you know confirm these two which they you know verified with the um the Stage Gulch area I don't you know area of critical concern no groundwater they confirmed and then they also said yeah you know there's uh it's possible to move water rights around in the Irrigation District but it would have to be triggered by a process and there would have to be it may not be possible because there would have to be like infrastructure on those um which there isn't on those site snaps um so that is what we're also going to recommend in the proposed order I think I'll stop there uh council member Jenkins was there another aspect that you raised and and um council member Howe in your DPO comments yeah sure that was not that was maybe missed in my all over the place summer let me go through my evaluation where we are with evidence that we have before us and the standard that's required um first of all these properties are in an exclusive Farm you sell them by Umatilla accountant we've identified two soils which is the Atkins fine Sandy loan about 235 Acres of that that's in a class four designation that's nrcs soil designation when not irrigated and I mean you know it's been shown that this property is not irrigated the Quincy fine Sandy loan is probably the poor the two soils there's only about 87 Acres of that um again it's not irrigated and it's a class seven as well it's not irrigated so this is kind of the worst of the worst it's not rock but it's not very good stuff both soils are about seven feet deep in thickness and they're flat zero to five percent slope so you know these are flat yeah the analysis area is predominantly comprised of durable soils which is the Atkins fine Sandy loan and I think that's very important to recognize that this isn't a rangeland these are there are social experimentally not irrigated I'm sure they're class four but they're still arable zones when not irrigating tax Lots around these two properties is 320 acres plus are all being farmed they are all being irrigated but they are all being farmed and have similar Souls Mr Scott's dry land farming in his property in 2013 and 2015 showed for production in dry land activities do I land weed the applicant has I believe adequately that without irrigation water that are and there's there is really no opportunity for high-value crops um and I think the applicant does adequately show them that irrigation water is not available through groundwater Source or through the irrigation districts but I asked the applicants at the last meeting I said okay but you haven't shown me that this property can't be used for driving and production one landowner wasn't successful for two years and the other landowner did not even attempt and so my concern is that the energy facility signing council's goal three requirements for reasons exception require that there's a demonstration that quote reasons justify why the Statewide policy in this case the Statewide policy is production of agricultural lands for agricultural use should not be applied and I think simply saying that one landowner couldn't make a profit over a two-year period without irrigation and the other landowner hasn't even tried to form their land could be an argument or reasons for about any land that's out there that's not being irrigated and so my concern was that I believe that the goal three acceptance process requires justification to demonstrate with reasons why this land is no longer going to be available for agricultural production in an exclusive Farm you sell it and it needs to be property specific I thought if we could show other non-irrigated properties in the area were not being used for crop land or grazing purposes and that water was not available and we could justify in the longer protecting this land for Farm use I think we've only gone halfway there we know the water is not available but we haven't been demonstrated that there are other properties in the area that aren't being used for agricultural production aren't that are in a drive-in situation the answer so my concern is that okay the land is not available is not being available is not available for Highland High value props but um we also don't know whether it's vile non-high Value comps such as dry land wheat or livestock rate all right without knowing whether these properties can be used for other economic reliable agricultural activities I can't support a little three exception for this property at this time thank you all right and to clarify uh for that because this is all this is under the minimal direct impacts to the subject you know I I don't know my concerned is that in order for us to accept the goal three exception we need something more than just it's more valuable person that the issue here is not whether it's valuable and the landowners are going to receive more economic benefit from it being a solar facility but it's we're taking this land out of agricultural production we basically are taking the zoning off of this property and saying it should be used for something else and I think we need reasons for doing that that are specific to this property not I didn't Farm it and it wasn't successful um two two years that I did so how many years do they need to demonstrate that they're losing money I'm not sure that it's the individual practices of the landowners it's what's going on in that area is that so when I drive across the Interstate 84 I see a lot of land that isn't irrigated in the Pendleton area well Pendleton's different than herbs okay and when I get all the way to Boardman you're not growing anything unless it's irrigated but I don't know what's going on in Hermiston if I'm unless I'm sure that I see a lot of land that is farmed in that area that isn't that is not irrigated and so that tells me that there is viability there for agricultural use on what else but I don't have the I haven't been provided the information that it's not viable for agriculture at least on blessing it's irrigated I've just been shown that it's not irrigated and there's not an opportunity for your in order to bolster that I asked for a more comprehensive assessment of the area and we didn't get it it's not in the 187 pages of supplemental information that we got and I don't understand why it's not there but I think it needs to be that we need something that is specific to that parcel in order to take it out of agricultural Productions yes and I agree with much of what councilor Jenkins has said I may come down on differently on whether or not they're not their burden of approved but this is this discussion of goal three is something that a council needs to take very seriously as we see more and more and bigger and more complex so this is kind of since I've been here this is the first test case on a goal three exception and what that burden of proof needs to be um and and we are to some extent setting a precedent so being very thoughtful about this is going to be critical as we look at other projects I've worked as the U",

        "text": " a really really good point um previously declined applications obviously welcome to resubmit just understand uh under statute that you can't apply for a rebate if you have already started construction as far as the battery being paired with the solar we have a number of contracts that were signed within the last nine months where they signed up for pv and storage we installed the storage but are waiting on the battery so they're paired on the same contract but the pbs are can they qualify for the in storage so so yeah so um for our purposes and this is particularly true it's my understanding right there's a pretty long lead time on a lot of batteries right now um we're not going to come out and ch and like check that you're putting them in like at you know on on tuesday for example so the expectation really is at from the point in which you've made your request for reservation and you've started installation to when you apply for your rebate um as long as the pv and the storage are installed at the time of the rebate request our our um assumption is that they were they were they were installed together so if you have a lag time between when you can physically do do the work that's fine that is fine and if you find yourself in a situation where you have a you've reserved john go ahead happy um but i think he's saying that they have already constructed the solar am i misunderstanding the question no that is correct we've installed the solar but we've been waiting on the battery so it's like can we get the 2500 storage rebate on the uninstalled oh right yeah okay no you actually can and there's and there's um there's some statutory reasons we have to they actually have to physically be installed for us to be in a position to issue the rebate yeah i'm sorry and so i guess what i'm saying is can we apply for the storage rebate on that battery that has not yet been installed then once we install the uh you know ask for the twenty five hundred dollars essentially okay so understanding so let me just tackle the from this perspective so to be able to receive the storage rebate you have to make a reservation for paired solar and storage so you so for example you couldn't do a you couldn't have an existing you couldn't do like hey i'm gonna get a solar rebate get the solar rebate and then say well i'm gonna add storage so you couldn't do that is that the scenario that you're contemplating um no i mean it's more these these contracts were signed as solar plus storage get our hands on the battery so we've already installed the tv we're still waiting on the battery so it's like hey can we get this 2500 rebate on the battery that we're about to install as soon as they come into stock they are prepared as part of the same project but you've already you've already received jurisdictional approval prior to 9.27 so it's already gone through electrical and building finals so the answer would be no i mean in some cases that's true in some cases we haven't uh received permission to operate on the pv well let me let me tyler let me ask you this question are these these are um projects in our in our system in in our power floor uh not in the state rebate power clear now okay so i'm just gonna hypothetically uh sort of kind of go through maybe some options so if you find yourself in a scenario in you have applied for the paired solar storage rebate you've been approved so we we have we're holding your rebate you install the solar and storage and then you have maybe a long lead time for the for the for the storage you you have a couple options so if you were to amend right your project to just exclude this the storage you you could do that you could say you know what this is just going to be a solar project and you could apply for rebate that way and we could issue the rebate in that case going back and then adding storage is something we couldn't do if you wanted to um if you didn't want to do that and you just wanted to wait for the solar to be in the storage to be installed you would just not apply for your final rebate and you would only apply for your final rebate once this the solar or that excuse me the storage had been installed because for our purposes and even if you had um even if you had two jurisdictional permits right one that said yep your solar is fine and your storage is fine as long as for our purposes as long as we had the contract that evidenced it was going to be a paired solar storage project and at and you've applied for rebate and we've got permits and invoices that reflect the installation of a paired solar storage we will be fine the gap in installation time wouldn't um would not be a barrier to being able to issue your john but i i'm sorry this is kathy conley assistant director for essential services and but i i do want to clarify that the project cannot have been constructed or begun construction before 27th of september and those that those are two different questions that they both got answered so thank you i appreciate it yeah yeah yeah tyler i i yeah i think i understand you're really just just like maybe beating this dead horse right you're really contemplating a scenario under you're doing a paired solar storage project you've already the solar is done and maybe signed off and you're just waiting for the batteries miss in that scenario can we still get our battery rebate correct yeah and the answer is like yes but you have to apply for the but for our purposes you would be needing to apply for the rebate for the solar and the storage at the same time and the solar could have not been installed there that's the that's the hang up there um i get it i think i follow it kathy answered the question sure sure we can always pop offline uh okay uh will there be a parent account for the accounting department to oversee the multiple salesmen who each enter a job or do you each tell them how to go and supply the document documentation to request a payout um there was a so there's some um upstream there is a functionality and power clerk to give folks account access to all the various users i'm not sure how to really answer this particular question um i guess because i don't i don't really have any insight into sort of how you want to operate your your business right like as long as someone has a if someone has a power clerk login and they have the ability to access all the projects that one individual can go and all the documentation um for the for the rebate request i don't see a problem with that but again he gets a that's a might be a better question for for like your peers you know other contractors that have worked in the system sort of how they handle navigating power clear but the electrical and building sign up still needs to be on or after nine yeah right so you're um i was just commenting on his battery thing so we already beat that dead horse yep you got it yeah can you please list what you'll have on hand to apply on monday for non-lmi applications so you will need a contract uh and uh if so for non-lmi applications you will need a contract with your customer and then in that contract uh we'll need to see the system specifications the total cost any cost any value of in utility incentives that are being and then we have some requirements related to uh warranties on the panels the workmanship and the and so we'd have to see that information in your contract as well that's 444 john good question from james that is a little different than last time what you just said that the manufacturer's warranties have to be in the contract i think it's just our warranty in the contract and then we turn around into power clerk what the main different manufacturer's warranties yeah let me uh just read the okay so uh the equipment purchased for a slow electric system repaired solar and storage system must include a manufacturer's warranty covering the following uh the inverters for a minimum of five years the modules for a minimum of 20 years and then all installations are covered by a system workmanship warranty yes so for your panels and inverters uh the panels and inverters just have to be covered by a manufacturer's warranty yes right that doesn't have to be in the language of our contract that we submit uh right yeah and in fact we can we can ascertain that information that no that's a that thank you james that's that is a good point it's really the total system workmanship warranty um that you as the contractor is providing would need to be in the contract yeah that's like that's a good great thanks uh will you need cad as well we do not require cad i know eto requires some line schematics we we do not uh where in the rules does it say oda will allow partial tsrf it does not say that in the rules that's our uh that is our pattern and practice based on our interpretation of the rule kindly remind me the contractor warranty uh sure so administrative rule zero zero three zero which is your project eligibility sort of rule block all installations of solar electric systems repaired solar and storage systems must include a total system workmanship warranty that covers the installation of solar panels inverters racking patented roof protection systems roof penetration batteries electrical mechanical parts and wiring for the duration of at least five years i'm here yep five years uh sorry just another clarification about the um the partial array uh qualifying do you want us to enter the whole array information into power clerk or just what would qualify for you know solar access you can do it either way we've done i've seen it done either way so i've if you if you enter the stuff that doesn't qualify um we'll see that in your reservation request and we'll have a conversation about it um i think my sort of my preference would be um if you know that you're going to have if you have an array where you know that part of it will not qualify that you just reach out to us just shoot us an email and let us know and we can provide guidance on the best way to proceed that'll just cut down on back and forth okay great thanks and again like i know there have been several questions on this but in terms of the 300 plus projects that we've done i think we've had less than five where um this has been an issue so again like hopefully this is hopefully people do not have significant numbers of projects that they're contemplating now answering for eto's power clerk you put",

        "text": " developed in oregon in location the location of renewable development can be significantly impacted by transmission access or lack thereof and the cost of that transmission on customers is an important consideration and rto may identify the most efficient upgrades needed to deliver renewables uh purpa lots of feedback on purple implications multiple commenters flagged ferc order they recently lowered the mandatory purchase obligation on utilities for renewable qfs from 20 to 5 megawatts but also noted that the basis for this change was that non-discriminatory non-discriminatory market access afforded by rto energy markets um and that this is something uh critical consideration during rto design existing qfs a note about this that came by multiple commenters the utilities have existing legally enforceable obligations to purchase power from some qfs and that would continue those agreements would be honored for their duration irrespective of rto formation retail rates one utility commenter asserted that it currently pays quote far more for generation from purple projects than for average market such that limitations on utility qf obligations from joining rto would quote be advantageous for oregon customer and some more on purpose disagree qf projects uh another another commentary caution that rto formation quote would incentivize qf's disaggregate to avoid limitations on utility purchase obligations for renewable sized greater than 5 megawatts ghg tracking um and again this will come up uh later it's more explicitly question about ghg in the next question but hb 2021 excludes perfect qfs from determining a retail electricity provider's overall missions for compliance with clean energy targets as a result rto formation would not likely have a significant impact in this regard streamline development the qf purchase limitation on renewables size more than five megawatts would streamline the development process increased competition and ease the administrative burden on utilities and stakeholders and switch topics here to distributed energy resources general comment new york and california each operate rtos and are widely viewed as states with the most successful der able to pair rtos with supportive legislation and mandates again resource agnostic came up in this that rto market should be agnostic towards specific resources and as such should fairly compensate ders for the value of energy capacity and great services provided work order two two two two uh i always want to make sure i get the rate number two's there uh requires rtos to adopt market rules to allow for aggravated ders to bid into energy markets as a single resource uh one commenter suggests that a northwest rto could identify best practices in kaiso and pjm and consult with pnnl to proactively facilitate the integration of ders system impacts uh one commenter notes the potential for ders to impact the grid in quote unanticipated ways due to the decentralized location of these resources and proposes centralized control of ders that are responsive to prices set by market principles as a way to mitigate these impacts and no impacts another commenter suggests that few ders would rise to the level of any rto impacts at all and this is the the last sub-topic here on manufacturing and jobs benefits multiple commenters expect that an rto would result in a net benefit to oregon something that was also found in the uh an increased opportunity for construction jobs to build renewables in was identified rtos can facilitate corporate renewable purchases which further supports additional renewable development jobs and as many commenters suggested may help encourage more corporations to locate in oregon again this uncertainty issue was raised right that without specific market design it's hard to really evaluate this in-state requirements multiple commenters voiced opposition to any state-specific job requirements on the basis that utility ratepayers should not subsidize economic development and that any effort by oregon to do this would likely prompt other states to do the and now we get to discussion questions so the the usual question there first do you support or oppose something would you emphasize something differently is there something missing i'll make a note here uh to raise your hand on the raised hand function while i read my other two questions here so two other questions that i'm throwing out here that i came up with based on some of the feedback so one on ders multiple commenters offered support for resource agnostic energy markets are there any particular concerns about how other rtos are designed that would disadvantage certain resources like ders or does fercorter222 sufficiently address this and another question on manufacturing this was just an interesting one to me i thought you know many commenters identified offshore wind developments as likely uh driven by an rto in oregon um but then at the same time commenters suggested an rto shouldn't be viewed as a tool to support in-state manufacturing but based on the nature of offshore wind curious to what extent committee members think rto formation would indirectly support in-state manufacturing related to offshore wind which is a very manufacturing intensive and certainly of interest to the south coast of oregon um so i see um fred hewitt has his hand raised um so we'll take fred first yeah obviously a lot that could be said about all these issues i'll keep it really brief and only really address two issues the der issue is i would observe especially from the eastern rtos there can be un imbalanced i don't actually have to describe it i don't want to say discrimination has lots of overlays to but some types of resources can be disadvantaged maybe a better way to say it based on market rules and this is a really pretty significant issue especially for demand response but also i think for renewables in some cases um a lot of it is tied to the resource adequacy construct in a particular rto and the rules around qualifying for ra or even being able to for example in a forward capacity market the rules may in effect create hurdles or even barriers for resources to participate to bid in to be selected so there's all those kinds of issues and i think uh on the you know kind of the normal day ahead real time dispatch level resources that you know can be uh bit in do bit in and you know dispatch the how they do it so i think there is you know there are some issues there to consider the other issue and i briefly just mentioned is purpa um i've looked pretty i'm certainly no expert on this and i'm not a ferc in the fur bar or anything like that uh the the section 210m you know which is the kind of source of all this as well as several for orders that the issue i find there is if you look around the rtos for a discussion about how smaller resources that would be purple resources participating in those markets i don't hear anything what has happened is especially with wind because wind is really you know the bigger you go the more economic it is this small wind it doesn't seem to be happening and i don't really think small solar is either and this is a policy issue for the state in my view i've always felt going way back that oregon should promote renewables at every scale because there's lots of reasons to do that community development resilience you know across the landscape uh and so on that go beyond just the straight economic you know are you in you know are you at least cost resource at that moment on the grid or not so i think this is something to consider is if ferpa no you know i have other issues other things to say about purpa but you know i really think there's of high value to having a diverse range of renewables in in oregon in the state and that is something to consider as if rto process goes forward how can states policy continue to support that effectively thanks thank you fred i see uh spencer uh has his hand raised next then i was gonna uh ask travis next if he's interested in speaking i know he had several comments uh on this topic uh not to put you on spot travis but i'm curious to hear your feedback on some of these issues so spencer thanks adam i just wanted to strongly concur with final slide that an rto formation leading to a stronger market signal for development of offshore wind in oregon of course it's possible to develop any number of new energy projects bilaterally having a contract signed between two counterparties with them figuring out the transmission rights in between the load and in an offshore wind project but i think overall for um full development and organ of the wind potential having a regional market operated through an rto is the best way to create a market signal for um for building offshore wind projects and then the second comment i wanted to add is to maybe move up to a 20 000 foot level on the slides you had about herpa and distributed energy resources to me the underlying value proposition for oregon and other states in the west for those topics is open access um in the case of purpa for those who don't follow purple closely um purp is a law passed by congress in 1978 that authorized renewable energy projects to have a right to interconnect and to sell power to utilities before any of these regional markets were created in 2005 congress declared in an rto congress is assuming there is open access for those projects to both interconnect to the market to the grid and to sell to to the basis of that decision by congress was that where you have an independent operator of transmission you're removing that incentive by a utility that owns the transmission to refuse to open their grid to access to generators other than themselves that is the value proposition for renewables developers in general for having an rto and congress recognize that fact insane for purper projects in rtos the must purchase obligation that we go through trench warfare in the west about because we don't have an rto that no longer has to happen for larger qf projects it's a little bit different for for the smaller qf projects and that that value proposition holds true as much for ders as well in that case it's less of a resistance by the utility transmission than the absence of an adequate platform in places without an rto that an rto thank you spencer i don't see other hands raised adam now i see him now i see a real hand i'm looking at my little digital hands sorry i couldn't figure out how to do it i haven't been i'm i'm new to this as well the only other organization that i know that uses this is bpa i one other thing i i just want to say first of all i really appreciate spencer laying that out",

        "text": " council be interested in staff putting together a draft condition for your review to make sure we're on the same page and we can come back in a standard or two cindy condon i i would appreciate that and so i mean since we're here are you envisioning a pre-construction requirement that a parent co guarantee or similar type of document be provided that affirms capital power stands behind the design build and operation of the project cindy conan again i yes here yeah if i may for the record talking i think this kind of tease up a good sort of procedural um check-in excuse me swallow it okay um and and if we need to seek clarification we will but this is a good example where you know a sort of a question or an idea was brought up and that's fine um and i think us sort of fleshing that out and sending it to council would also be good but it also is very important that we know um what you're interested in so as much clarification and direction from you today really helps us because what we're now functionally is we're taking our findings and conditions from the draft proposed order and based on your comments making changes and so we obviously want to make sure that we're doing that in a way that represents what you're interested in so you know as we go through this to the extent that you can you know it may be that you know you need us to provide some language and some ideas for you to respond to and that's okay but just uh you know as much clarification to us um it would be uh very helpful so madam chair this is hanley a question for todd um are you envisioning procedurally are you envisioning sending out some draft language before you do the final order how are we going to do this okay yeah um and we'll talk about that a little more in detail but i think just very briefly i think most of the time you know when you provide a question or a comment or you know we'll know what that means i think it's only those ones where we may need to um you know flesh it out so in this case i mean we could send it out to everybody maybe we just send it out to councilmember condon for her response to make sure that we're getting correctly what she wants so i don't think it's going to be a draft of the proposed order that we're seeking your comment on the entire thing um just um sort of specific elements that we want to make sure we're getting i just didn't want to add steps to the process yeah oh sorry yes go ahead ann empire um the question for cindy um is is the stands by language a problem does that need to be spelled out more i like mirroring the language and the standard but what is the parent company standing by is that language okay for you cindy condon if if it is correct that we can that stands by means guarantee or warranty um that that works it might be best to use guarantee or warranty and i'm not an attorney so i don't really know what the difference is that's making sure we met your content cindy conning if i can make further comment that i don't know if this um helps at all in terms of direction but in the application um the articles of incorporation for nolan hills there is a specific um provision for and i'm sorry i don't have it pulled up here um but for third parties and it's that you know nolan hills is who we are relying on nobody else um even though the the parent the parent llc is their element elemental power um or element power and um and then capital power in its two forms um and so it's trying to get to if the liability is limited to to um the project specific llc but we're relying on that parent do we need to have the parent in in the um guaranteeing it in writing so oh does that help cindy caught it again i have a uh just a follow-up question in the documents capital power it's capital power dba as nolan hills uh capital power independent nolan hills independent but kind of used interchangeably is the dba accurate is in the letter um some of the documents get and i don't have it in front of me um but it it says dba nolan hills and i i was surprised by that okay what we can go on but i can find it and if we can come back to that all um there there we go yeah no it was a something that was to it but it was oh so information about the applicant so uh prepared for capital power dba nolan hills wind llc um on exhibit a and so you know i didn't know whether that was maybe tetratex air is it really a dba are they independent i just think it's confusing and if we're relying on we want to be sure what we're who we're relying on or which entity and the organizational structure thank you so you're dead yes so that is um the conclusion of our presentation of the council comments related to organizational expertise so no more comments questions oops maybe one more okay so we're going to move on to so under the structural standard council is required to evaluate the proposed facility to ensure that it complies with regulations related to seismic hazards and other events that may cause site instability under this standard council evaluates whether the applicant has adequately characterized the site in terms of stability if there are unstable or erosion prone soils the council looks for evidence that the applicant will use proper engineering techniques to avoid hazards the department also consults with the oregon department of geology and mineral industries also known as dogami to determine compliance with this so in the dpo the applicant has presented that it can construct that it will conduct a pre-construction site specific study a geotechnical the department consulted with dogami we also had a professional engineer from a third party consultant with hart krauser to review the information that was submitted and along with the applicant in the discussions over the application agreed that a pre-construction site-specific geo-tech study is required and this is really intended to inform the final design and layout of the facility to ensure that it is seismically sound and also meets the so in our dpo we have that that study be conducted and that is condition number one we did receive a comment from councilmember jenkins at the hearing he had a question about the applicability of the the condition to the non-seismic hazards and it is my understanding as i read it geotext study that needs to be done would cover both components however based upon our review we felt that the information provided by the applicant in the application was sufficient for us to conclude that they met the i don't know if there's go ahead need to include the non-seismic in the geotech investigation well i think it would be covered and i don't think it would be a deficiency to add that it's mentioned in the non-seismic analysis so i think it's it could just be clarified that it it would cover both okay okay thank you any other comments okay so the next standard we're going to cover is the soil protection standard and under this standard council is required to determine whether or not the applicant has fully the issues of erosion and drainage as a result of facility construction that could affect land in the surrounding the applicant is required to consider potential impacts on soils from the facility's operation such as cooling towers or other forms of deposition if they were applicable if the proposed facility will have a significant impact on soils that cannot be prevented the council must include in the site certificate conditions that require mitigation of those impacts so in the dpo the applicant identified the soil types within the analysis area they came up with 10 different soil types within the proposed site boundary eight of these soil types are silt loams with depths ranging from half a foot to greater than seven feet deep and they are classified as having moderate to high permeability they are located on slopes ranging from 1 to 40 percent they have erosion hazard ratings from slight to severe and that's discussed within the dpo so our primary methods of dealing with soil soil protection and potential soil are through the issuance and the requirements associated with the national pollutant discharge elimination system or the npdes 1200c construction and it includes a requirement for an erosion and sediment control plan those documents also detail what we call best management practices or bmps which are really the implementary requirements on the construction activities and contractors to ensure that we are protecting soils in the of the facility so it's to prevent erosion it's part of our inspection routine and they're all included in the soil product protection conditions in the dpo we're going to get to land use and i'm turning it over to sarah sarah will go into detail about the two-mile setback and the goal three exception requests thank you so um just as a brief overview of how i'm gonna run the presentation i'll be toggling between the powerpoint comments that were received and places in the dpo so that you can see what i'm saying in case it's not totally clear so the first thing is a refresher on the council's land use standard so the land use standard requires council to find that an applicant and the proposed facility can comply with applicable substantive criteria from the county's acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and then the standard actually provides three paths for how to interpret that requirement and make findings i'm going to show you okay so hopefully you can kind of see that the three paths are then here under little b sub two b of the land use standard and it basically says either council finds that the proposed facility complies with all applicable substantive that's path a path b is they don't comply with an applicable substantive criteria so either council approves an exception or otherwise finds that the proposed facility would be consistent with statewide planning goals or path c which is the project is consistent with statewide planning goals for this project the applicant has requested council review under path b um and so that is how the analysis in the proposed in the draft proposed order is presented um and so like what the applicant doesn't comply with is the acreage threshold for solar which is the goal exception so that's kind of what triggers path b so as kate mentioned in the intro the facility is proposed to be located in umatilla county so it is then umatilla county's development code and",

i believe uh that the other site boundaries are clipped so they don't appear in the middle but there may be some there is some overlap any other questions about this map and i will point out the um we did we received this notice of intent on may 10th it is available from our website if the in if the council member does have questions on it um i think there will be further opportunities to review this um and certainly it's out for public comment now oh and we do have a public information meeting scheduled on this for uh later in july in boardman um i can get that exact date well i will continue with my presentation i believe it's july 27 but i don't want him to speak for the record todd cornett and and you know if any council member would like to attend that either in person or virtually uh please let us know um we'll get you all the information um as well so and obviously you are not required but would be welcome if you wanted to attend but are those also recorded so that we could thank you yes uh council member buyer um yes so uh we they didn't used to be but now they are um and so um what we will do is whether it's all virtual or if it's a those will be webinars that for all future public information meetings we will record those and post them on the project site so that will be our practice moving forward has been for the last couple but definitely will be moving forward in case somebody's interested but doesn't have the opportunity to attend they can go back and watch those recordings so christopher i assume boardman is due north you see the interstate 84 i see the proposed b2h line assume or go straight north of the dash the purple dash blue purple and white line is that the city city of boardman i believe it's a little bit north and to the east it comes with yes this this other map may provide a little bit better view but yeah it's just a little to the west with um lexington and hebner to the south okay for um this particular step uh rs 469 480 subsection one requires the council to designate the governing body of any local government whose jurisdiction the facility is proposed to be located as a special advisory group the proposed facility is located entirely or is supposed to be located entirely within morrow county the morrow county board of commissioners is the governing body of morrow county um and as such we recommend that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as a special advisory group for proceedings related to the echosolar project and with that i will leave it to your madam chair i move that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as a special advisory group for council proceedings related to the proposed eco-solar project thank you kent septon cindy condon thank you cindy any further questions comments we have a motion in a second hearing then mr secretary please call the roll hanley jenkins yes barry choctoot ken howe yes and buyer marcy grail yes jordan truitt cindy condon yes motion carries madam thank you very much thank you chris it's my bruce time is now 10 56 so little assistance please so madam chair the next agenda item which is we have time certain on the agenda as well as um clarified no availability for uh hearing officer so we will need to go into recess until 12 30. as you just heard we will now be recessing until 12 30. and i would like to call the meeting back from recess and continue on with the next agenda item okay thank you um the next agenda item is the nolan hills wind power project this is a continuation of public hearing on draft proposed order on application for site this hearing will be presided over by kate triana senior administrative law judge at the oregon office of administrative hearings she will facilitate the continuation of the draft proposed order public hearing for the applicant to respond to issues raised on the record of the dpo from april 19th through may 26 2022 lj triana if you may please take over okay great great thank you hi i'm alj katriana and as mentioned this is the continuation of the nolan hills wind power project public hearing on the draft proposed order or dpo on the application for site certificate uh this hearing was continued uh from the prior hearing may 26 2022 through today june 24 2022 specifically to allow the applicant an opportunity to review and respond to issues raised in comments received at that prior hearing this hearing at this point is limited for the applicant responses information specifically related to issues raised on the record of that hearing i have received uh two requests to submit additional i'm going to address that a little bit but i do have that on the agenda as well so as mentioned i'm an administrative law judge for the oregon office of administrative hearings i've been appointed as the efsc appointed hearing in this matter as well and i'm serving as the presiding officer for the hearing today is friday june 24th 2022 it's about 12 32 p.m uh pacific time the hearing today is being held at the energy facility citing council or efsc being held in person at the oregon department of energy offices in salem the hearing is also being held via a webex webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar so we have some people present in person at the department of energy offices we have several people participating by webex including myself and then we also have some call-in uh and this is being recorded so let's see kathleen sloan senior sighting analyst at the oregon department of energy and lead on the application for site certificate for the nolan hills wind power project is going to provide a very brief project and procedural overview um and then i'll take back over and we'll we'll get so ms sloane if you'd like to get started okay thank you alj triana and for the record my name is kathleen sloan i'm a senior sighting analyst for the oregon department of energy and we are opening agenda item k which is the continuation of the public hearing on the nolan hills wind power project and the draft proposed so just very briefly i'm going to give you a overview of the agenda item so a brief facility overview a brief procedural overview and then i will turn it back over to the alj to continue the hearing so the nolan hills wind power project is located in northwestern umatilla county nolan hills wind llc is a subsidiary of capital power corporation the proposed facility is a combined wind and solar energy facility with a maximum generating capacity of 600 megawatts and approximately a 48 000 acre site the project also includes related and supporting facilities including a dispersed or centralized battery storage system or a bus and two proposed options for a 230 kv gentile line transmission line the procedural history the notice of intent was filed in september of 2017 a draft proposed order was issued by the department on april 19 2022 the public hearing was opened in on may 26 2022 and as the alj noted at the request of the applicant the record was held open for the applicant to respond to comments that hearing was held open until today june 24 2022 and that is what we are doing in this agenda item so in the continuation of the hearing council rules require that the council department and applicant have an adequate opportunity to respond to issues that are raised and comments that are received on the record of the draft proposed order during the public hearing the scheduled hearing on may 26 was extended at the request of the applicant to respond to the issues and comments that were at the hearing so the hearing again was extended until um 30 days to give the applicant time to and at this point i'm going to turn it over to the alj who will provide the applicant the opportunity to speak or provide more so amj triana i am turning it back over to you thank you okay great um all right so uh this is alj triana as uh ms sloane noted the hearing record was held open for the specific purpose of allowing the applicant to respond to some of the comments raised at the public hearing from both council and members of the public between the time of that may sorry what's the date on that the prior hearing in may may 26th and today the department of energy received two emails requesting these people be allowed to provide public comment or written comments and that those be made part of the record as well and so i want to address those on the record now and make a ruling on that so the department when they received the emails forwarded them to me and has requested that i make a decision so i'll be doing that it appears that uh the two emails i received um the department received and forwarded to me were sent on uh june 22nd and june 23rd but both for uh blue mountain alliance so i'm gonna kind of address them together um is there anyone with blue mountain specifically daniel kearns with us today if so speak up or raise a hand please okay i'm not noting anyone um ms sloane there in salem do you have anyone present yes we do sorry so i'm gonna i'm gonna let him introduce he has his mic on richard jolly with blue mountain okay great and mr jolly um what is your affiliation with blue mountain alliance and daniel kearns can you explain that just a little bit to me yes i'm a member of the board and the board selected daniel kearns as our uh to contact um you in your office and i hadn't heard back from him and so i uh contacted the office also okay and are you expecting that mr kearns is going to appear at all today at this public no i don't believe so but i believe he responded and has sent in our statement okay and so i did receive this email from him um that included an attached letter and mr jolly have you had an",

        "text": " now what is to stop Marion County from coming to you with any of the codes that they're violating that they don't like and now having you amend 10 other codes Marion County codes that's the problem I foresee Gene can you speak I don't I mean it's not a practice of Marion County to just go and violate codes and ordinances like I've only been here two years but we have a pretty stellar legal team that makes sure we don't do that I think there's a I think my understanding of the underlying case wasn't that funny was that we didn't have the authority as an applique as a easement holder under our code to be an applicant and what Luba said was if you want to be an applicant you have to amend your code so that's why we're here today it's not that we're we violated anything it's that we were directed to take this action if we want to be an applicant thank you can I ask a question Brandon so is there a way in this change to make sure that we're not removing the and I don't know that we are I understand your perspective Julie I don't want to say that I don't but I I as a commissioner I'm never going to take his position that removes the rights of a landowner just as a government like I'm fundamentally opposed to that type of behavior but I don't feel like with the education that you've provided me up to this point that that was that that's the intention of so a property owner in a way they can't they couldn't apply for a public works project a property owner if most of the what the county owns is within an easement and so you've got a roadway easement saying you're adding a travel Lane the property owner couldn't make that application because they don't have the the background or the the right to use that easement to develop a road project but we have the ability to make this signature so we have to match it up so that we have the right to do certain work in an easement we're able to make an application and then we can also sign that application is there a way in this process to prevent the removal of the owner's signature let's say that you go through all these historical documents and you you you are legally it's legally found that there was no like proper easement transfer and I'm sorry Julie I don't know your last name Kramer Mrs Kramer's family is actually the land owner with no like legal guidelines for the county to do what they're assuming to do they have the position to be able to say no if there's no easement but yeah so I understand there has to be back you're saying there's an easement she's saying there's not that's a very different situation than what we're trying to do right now but what I want to understand is that currently right now is there a way to put the verbiage in there that if it's determined that the easement wasn't actually legally identified or it was confusingly identified that the property owner has first right of refusal for that ability that's how we would apply this proposed code no easement then we wouldn't be able to make a signature or make an application it would revert back to the property owner we would have to acquire some form of easement to be able to proceed and even if we were spending money like on a federal project a road project we didn't have the right like easement we wouldn't be able to spend the money and do that I haven't seen the verb it's but does it specifically state that I don't think my attorney saw that or he wouldn't have he wouldn't be objecting to this so the public agency or utility or an entity if the public agency or utility holds an easement or other right that entitles the applicant to conduct and proposed on the subject property without the approval of the property owner okay so it states that there has to be an easement in place in order for this action to okay I have one other question there there's another code and I'm sorry I don't have the codes in front of me so I don't know the number but there is one code that they're clearly violating that it's a code that states there will be no change of use and we've got um I'll just use one as an example trespassing which is caused by the fact that it's owned 24 hours a day open 24 hours a day so that is clearly a violation of Marion County code that there won't be changes to existing use I believe that's the so that's one of our objections that we're fighting this would you not would you submit a code change on that I think that's in the greenway code and that's a state that's a state code it's reviewed by the state we have very limited abilities to make changes tell us what Greenway means Greenway is an area along the Willamette that when you're on the river it looks green it looks native you can have enjoy the time on the river and when you're off the river you still have a lot of vegetation so it's a nice vegetation native Forest type of Zone once if we're able to make a Greenway permit and we're able to consider either approving or denying it and we can include conditions and we can help either mitigate those conditions could help either mitigate the change of use associated with with the um the right-of-way or the um I could deny it and say this is not an appropriate use in the greenway until we get into that process to the land use case so we can consider that we're not able to put those kind of conditions or review that kind of verbiage and it's a state code so that there's nothing I can do to change it just so you know um is there a way to interpret is it's Unique this particular environment is unique on the limit because of where the residences exist for the pathway and access to the river it's like super unique so you just you know my son lives on the Willamette and people drive by his house all the time is there a way in the greenway code to be able to interpret more restrictive access if there's homes within certain feet or you know space of the greenway like to look at the impact on the surrounding I'll have to I'd have to take a look there are there's 13 different criteria and some of them do involve impacts to the to the areas we'd have to take a look at that and that's one of the arguments if we had a land use case one of the arguments an opponent could make is about the impacts and the inability to mitigate those impacts okay thank you commissioner Cameron do you have anything well yeah just reading the letter Brandon were these code amendments not given to the Planning Commission no they came out during the process they went they came out during the they emerged during the process so it's a legislative action that the board takes and to amend the code and if we had some testimony of the Planning Commission none of that seemed like something we brought would bring forward as proposed amendments to the board um but if amendments come up during this time we're able to consider them and incorporate them at the public hearing before the board and have that consideration I just want to clarify when you say they didn't go before the Planning Commission is that because the Luba decision came out it came out of the process it came out during the process and the discussions came out later all right okay are you going to going to may I ask may I ask all right um I guess my question to the brand and we received no notice of this hearing today and it was um someone in my attorney's office happened to catch it no one in the neighbor Community received any notice and you mentioned I think that something happened in August related to this we this is only Friday we heard about today's hearing I'd like to actually just address that so we don't actually send notices to every resident in Marion County on public hearings that are broad to the entire County if this was a case that was specific to you you'd receive a direct notice but this isn't specific to you this is a entire packet that applies to the entire Marion County and we have legal responsibilities to notify the public in certain means and I assume that that was done through public noticing in newspapers and so forth so while it would be lovely if we could afford to do that direct notification it's just not something that we can do and this isn't specific to you so I know that you feel like it is and I want to honor that but it's not it's the entire what did trigger this the land use board of appeals decision so all of these amendments this is a big packet right we're talking about one specific amendment in this big packet the legislature changed the law on a lot of things right and so so then we had to make changes in our code based on this right it sounds like the specific one that you're talking about one of the reasons is this this Luba decision right um that says in order for the county to make an app a land use application we have to be able to sign the application that we submit right that came to light and memory serves years ago this almost came up once but it didn't require any land use in the easement and so it wasn't an issue but whenever there's any land use requirement in an easement there's a disconnect and so that that development that Federal investment in any kind of roadway project could never happen until we get this cleared up to be able to make the application so that the Luma decision brought it to light that we needed to make a change and there was a disconnect in our code yeah yeah Jane's just notifying me that so this packet process like what we're here today to talk about in this specific how the caring started in 2021 because of the legislature changes I would assume that through uh all work that anyone does when you learn something new you try to keep and it's not working out for a particular situation you try to change it in your particular situation there's an action that Public Works was aware of and then whatever that action was and I don't have all the details all I've had Community people talk to me about it there's a need for us to change our code even in your case yes that's what presented this to come forward but there's likely other situations throughout the county that would apply to this particular code what I don't want is for you to leave here today thinking that we've made a decision that directly impacts you today because there has to be",

        "text": " build maybe a one and a half megawatt hydropower facility next to the airport there there's also another potential hydropower facility that could be built about a mile away that would be more like two megawatts further up the road there's a 10 megawatt solar facility a little further up the road there's another three and a half megawatt hydropower facility so within a relatively small radius you have all of these facilities that potentially could be leveraged to keep that redmond airport site and other critical facilities in that area energized during or shortly after a cascadia event so the key barriers that we've seen i'm just going to touch on three i think you know maggie gave such an impressive laundry list and we've seen all of those as well but um the the top three for us low ppa prices or power purchase agreement prices so success in the context again of irrigation modernization means getting close to eight cents per kilowatt hour on a sustained basis over time not accounting for inflation again the goal for these projects isn't to just survive it's to be able to reinvest revenues into that bigger modernization picture to accelerate those community benefits so what we've seen over the past decade in gen or generally is that markets have been in flux but they've been generally trending downward i think it's really hard to know where things are going to be headed in the next decade there's a lot of different competing forces at play what we've tried to do is think about if there's ways to have a side door to take a full advan or take more advantage of the additional benefits and the resilience benefits that these projects can provide so the community-wide green tariff pathway that was created through house bill 2021 last year gives away for a local community to try to secure those long-term energy resilience benefits as well as the economic or other non-energy benefits that can be provided through you know an irrigation district conduit hydropower project or any other local or regional project that prevents potentially provides a price certainty that can't be found on the market right now while also at the same time potentially giving a path for the utilities to to find some profit through that system so when we think about these irrigation hydropower projects and those the potential costs that going through a community-wide green tariff pathway might impose onto that i think it's probably at the scale of these projects i think it's basically noise when we compare it to the larger scale grid changes that are going to be happening over the next several decades but these projects can provide some real benefits back to the community in terms of energy resilience am i doing no time christy i can't hear you i'm sorry i'm sorry i was muted you have a minute left okay last two t last two things really fast interconnection costs um especially with the the investor owned utilities um like others have said interconnection processes have lacked transparency the costs have escalated dramatically over the last 10 to 15 utilities don't have to show their work in the process sometimes mistakes are made the developer is often responsible for catching that making mistake and trying to fix it we've again tried to shift our focus onto projects that have community resilience benefits to try to avoid some of those challenges if the utility and the community can be aligned uh we're hopeful that that we can avoid some of interconnection cost issues last piece wheeling costs are a really significant issue for a lot of the projects that we work with so in consumer owned utility territory those costs have been a really big challenge the costs are set by each utility there's no regulatory oversight over those costs in some cases they appear reasonable and others they basically exclude that utility service territory from any sort of project development happening because you just simply can't export the power at a reasonable price and their ppa prices are too low to move forward i'll stop there thank you thanks jen and hopefully you can stick around if there's any questions for you in the chat um and i don't see any specific hands up although i missed rain feast and mike last time but in the interest of time it would be great to move on and then um if anyone have questions pop them in the chat that seems to be working well and then we can move on to our last presenter thank you for your patience all right yeah and thank you jed for um bringing it home bringing it in on time that was um that was informative we will move on to agrivoltaics so um duggan take it away thank you um and you can move on to my my first slide uh hello everyone my name is dugan marab i'm the regulatory associate at uh pine gate renewables i'm here to speak about our efforts to go beyond solar with the eagle point project and how that relates to opportunities and challenges in small-scale uh solar in oregon next slide please so um bindgate renewables is a solar and storage developer out of north carolina and our mission is to get solar done and despite being across the country we have several um operating projects in oregon as well as a few more in development and i myself grew up in oregon so it's nice to get to work in the state um it feels a little bit like going home so um that's great can we go off to the next slide environmental impact so with our projects pine gate puts a special emphasis on our environmental impacts how we're interacting with the communities we work in we specifically have a program called solar culture which is our initiative to protect project protect and preserve agricultural land on which our solar farms exist to help native plants and animals thrive and so we've incorporated pollinator habitats and native seed plantings on eight of our farms in north carolina and oregon and you can see a picture here of the project we are about to talk about let's go to the next slide so eagle point is solar culture in action for us this is a solar completed solar farm in jackson county completed in 2018. it's around it's on around 50 acres of previously vacant fresh land has a nameplate capacity of 9.9 megawatts of solar energy with enough to power about 1500 homes when developing the project we decided it would be a great place to try something new as part of our new solar culture initiative so we worked with a ecological services firm to choose a native feed mix and worked with a local firm understory consulting to implement that vision this site includes native flowering that provide great forage for pollinators including bees that are actually brought to the site by our partner old soul apiaries you can see actually john uh who runs that uh without the beekeeping seuss over there because he's the professional we actually have 57 apiaries uh on site uh so 850's and highs um that use the site for forage and make agricultural products like honey and beeswax and queens this type of use is also currently being studied with a partnership with the national renewable energy laboratory or nrel they currently have a one acre plot that is studying this site in addition to this we actually worked with caldera brewing to use some of the honey from the site to make a let's be friends ipa uh beer which is oregon's first solar farm beer so a lot of really cool stuff that was done on on this project and i think it's really great example kind of creative thinking can be done to do some combinations of agriculture and clean energy if we could go to the next so um well here's a photo of everyone cheers in the beer first we're very excited about uh but evil point came together through a lot of hard work both on the pine gate side but also especially our partners on the ground uh this took a lot of work to you know come up with this plan get these native do continuous management of the site which is which is another issue in dual use um and so uh the benefits of dual use of projects like eagle point or of course at the clean energy but also um you know when we're specifically planting different seeds you know the the normal i guess the status quo is planting turf grass and so planting these more native grasses means that we don't have to mow as much which is a benefit to the to the developer or the owner of the project um there's productive use and restoration of underutilized land again this use this was vacant brush land before it was utilized for this project there are ecological benefits of native prairie which i'll mention in a second and also other things you want maybe especially think about supporting local local native seed farmers and supporting community native uh plant conservation or if you need demand for there to be a business around producing native seed and producing these these very valuable and um you know getting rarer seeds so these projects really provide that demand supporting local small businesses like old soil apiaries and producing agricultural products and providing forage for pollinators who benefit other agricultural area operations areas you know there's not just the beef that we're specifically putting on there there's other benefits to other farmers who have um who need pollinator services uh we actually just talked to sean prive of understory consulting our on the managers and they're currently contracting with local farmers to grow a seed mix that will be partially used on eagle point in some government projects and he said that it has allowed for collaborations between ngos local farmers uh state and federal agencies that could have never otherwise existed and it's hard to put into words how beneficial it is to put both restoration practitioners and local farmers together for this next slide please here's just a quick list of all the ecological benefits of doing this kind of development where we're combining clean energy with this very important pollinator native seed work next slide please in terms of challenges there are a lot of challenges with doing this kind of work this especially with a novel approach when we did it back in um there's a large uh time and monetary commitment in in that novelness and especially a large upfront monetary cost of doing this different type of seating doing a lot of hands-on management in the first few years of trying to get the native seeds to be the dominant seed on the site in addition of course we're trying to not have our plants be supplanted by weeds there are type specific issues each site is unique uh there's difficulty enacting these issues on very large sites given first of all the upfront costs but also sometimes just the availability of native seed it's",

that government controls are in place that if a wrong has occurred there is a natural path to both report and have the situation rectified by uh an individual or a company who is in violation our

making and we actually would like to see more of such Investments not less and we have an incredible Workforce that is not Portland base is not giant corporation based but our true neighbors and our community and they were quite offended by the notion that they wouldn't pay people what they were worth or earned or that they would be unethical in their business model it was quite the contrary they want those businesses completely out of the ecosystem because it's their competitors potentially and so by having wages and and rates that are competitive in the market it allows those dollars not just to stay local but they're ethically uh they're delivered and if there's a complaint there is a mechanism that they can go through uh to have those situations resolved I believe our local

that this can be a Bittersweet time of year for many the holiday season can be exhausting for our single parents out there the holiday season can be tough for children who are in to new homes and new relationships like the more than 200 children who are in foster care right here in Maran County the holidays can be difficult for caregivers who take care of a person in their lives who is struggling with disabilities uh or mental illness or any other number of issues the holidays in a word can be a very complex time of year so I urge everyone out there practice practice kindness and practice patience especially for those who are running around trying to make a holiday special on a limited budget with limited means so to transition I'd like to now thank the Salem Main Street Association for putting together an incredible Downtown Salem holiday parade kudos to our mayor and Mr Claus who made an appearance that night for the tree and also kudos to City councelor Julie Hoy thank you so much for marching with us in the parade Kasa Marin County was there to support and help spread holiday cheer and there were gosh I'm not sure how many people who turned out but a lot so I know that pulling off an event like this takes a huge amount of work by the volunteers the parade organizers the First Responders who shut down the streets people who coordinated all of us who are Marching In

read that we don't have anybody to receive that tonight but we do want to get it on the record thank you and Dan has the microphone for you can everyone hear me thank you Proclamation whereas December 7th 1941 marks a somber day in United States history and whereas we remember the more than 2,400 Americans who lost their lives on that day including 1,12 Sailors permanently intuned in the USS Arizona and where as in a speech the following day to a joint session of Congress President Franklin Del Delano Roosevelt declared December 7th 1941 as a day that will live in infy and whereas the events of that tragic day on the Hawaiian island of aahu at Pearl Harbor propelled America into World War II and gave the nation a resolve that sustained the nation to Victory and whereas because of this victory for democracy and the sacrifices and suffering endured to secure it the United States has come to know our enemies um of then as allies today and now therefore on behalf of of Chris Hoy mayor of the City of Salem due hereby Proclaim December 7th 2023 as Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and encourage the community to reflect on the Hiser historic events that occurred 82 years ago and pay tribute to those whose lives were lost dated this fourth day of December 2023 chriso thank you certainly thank you I just want to add to that that um my husband is third generation American Japanese and his um his father's family was interned and the oldest son did inlist in the 442 and was wounded received a purple heart so again this is certainly a day of remembrance for our family thank you counselor and next up we have human rights day and I would like to ask councelor Barney to come forward to read that one also I would like to call up hamat Jackson and Lisa Novak to receive proclamation is it on yes whereas December 10th 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the universal Declaration of Human Rights by the general assembly of the United Nations and whereas the Preamble of the universal Declaration of Human Rights States disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in bar barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind and the Advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and Freedom From Fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people whereas uh as mayor and as a member of this community I share in the community's concern as we see our fellow human beings suffer inequity and discrimination and we work alongside each of you in standing up against bigotry and taking action in support of Human Rights and whereas the City of Salem by definition the city of peace supports freedom for all its people and recognizes the need to address issues of racism poverty homelessness discrimination based on religion sexual orientation gend gender identity and more while knowing that in our Global Society no person is free until all persons are free and now therefore I on behalf of Chris Hoy mayor of the City of Salem Oregon do hereby Proclaim December 2023 as human rights day in Salem in Salem and we urge all in the community to respect this day as

        "text": " that easy analysis didn't occur then there would be essentially I'll just say sort of automatic land use restrict on development under the Metro rules um that could prohibit uh most but not necessarily all level of development um so I guess maybe some thought I have is uh to the degree that we're relying on some of that Upland habitat area including those areas that have been concept planned as mix employment for sort of meeting some large parcel land need um I would encourage us to sort of think of ways that we could find the large parcels and meet Industrial Development elsewhere outside of the Upland area um I'm curious about some I was looking at scenario f um I'm sorry scenario e the one right before this and there's that Dash blue line that follows the Northeast edge of the Upland habitat area which um I like and I'm wondering if it's necessary to also have that dashed Blue Line further south or if that road segment could be removed in order to avoid the potential of you know uh severing this Upland habitat and building roads closer to that riparian area um but those are just my thoughts thank you thank you Glen any other observations from members Mike has his hand up Mike Weston oh thank you so I was looking at this a little bit and I'm wondering the trail I believe you guys had a trail kind of going along Coffee Creek and do you have a trail that's also underneath the power yes and so you're looking at the roads I would caution about making larger blocks because of the walkability piece like even if it's uh having those roads provide backbones for pedestrian and bicycle accessways and while a large site is great for industrial purposes maybe you still have uh public rights away within those industrial areas to allow some walkability and connectivity for the adjacent neighborhoods um we have an industrial area in around ours that actually has like nice walkways and bike areas that you know I often jog or bike B and they work great you know so just thinking of that in mind sometimes industrial uses don't play very nice but sometimes they can be very nice features for the neighborhood great thank you Mike Glenn I see your hands up yeah I think all on the same theme of of kind of block sizing I I I feel um you what some well a questions actually before this first I couldn't I'm understanding the new EA work is making the recommendation for the large slot availability I I get one of my questions would be before you do too much is are you going to um prohibit subdividing smaller scales to keep that large site um if you're not then I don't know if it's worth all the machinations to to to create a large site because it's you know once there's a tough one right you create those large sites then you got to stick stay your guns and wait until the till the buyer comes in to let users come in you don't get you so some you're going to get pressure from those land owners right away saying came the ugb you guys want to do something I want to go I've got these three people who want to do these 15 acre projects that you know it's great if that's what you want but if it's not what you want then you know how to business but that's that's something to consider um what I would say froment finding standpoint is you know I feel like the connectivity itself is more important than the locations of the facilities so one of the things I've done when I've standards you know for places such as this or different places is like hey uh however long your frage is you're going to get one road you're one arterial or you're going to get two collectors or whatever it's going to be first developer gets to decide where that's going to be as long as with the spacing parameters so imagine if you just took off the RADS and put graph paper on it you can do enough dots that's where where a line crosses your property if you got one you find one somewhere as long as it's not too close to another so that would be administrative way to allow ow for the lines to shift based on development proposals um rather than be you know within within that range so just my thought I think it's pretty important to keep that connectivity as Mike noted um for you know multimodal transportation of All great okay Jes well I really appreciate what um what was just said but and and I would add to that I think of it more from a market driving perspective and I mean putting power aside we'll have some other conversations about Portland General um it what I observe in responding to requests for property and for industrial customers is that we do not within the greater Metro and Valley area have sizes lot sizes or parcel sizes that are large enough for a majority of the leads that we get and so it really in my opinion comes to what does the city or the council want to see on the kinds of Industrial Development out there do you want a you know larger um manufacturing kind of process out there or do you want smaller uh requests so the average acreage that I have been observing Lately from business Oregon when they send out requests for are at least 35 Acres minimum most of them want more close to a 100 and we just you know this doesn't meet a 100 Acre need very well unless you put it all in that but but just the comment really being that that it's important to consider what does the Industrial Market need and use and what's the average size of a project happening right now and the number of jobs and such that might be associated with that that so Portland General can Will and as as we do in any of these serve whatever the city decides on um but um I I just think you need to spend some time thinking about who are those Industries you want to Target and what are the acreages that those Matt uh yeah thank you um just one observation and then more of a a comment to one observation in one of the earlier slides that you had Brian there was um mention of a community park kind of to the west of elw Road and I wonder given the conversation around upin habitat and riparian areas if if those areas could also serve as a community park thinking about um land that can be taxed and Community Parks which are not taxed and if um I know uh commun local governments all across Oregon really face strong fiscal challenges and so if an Upland habitat or riparian Zone could be used for a community park that might be a more advantageous use of those uh properties with given that uh lens that perspective um so just a thought there um and I guess the other thing is I just keep staring at the BPA line and just thinking oh gosh how unfortunate so I don't know I think McKenzie y all are the experts I would just be uh interested I was kind of zooming around on Google Earth kind of looking at other typologies in our region of how uh industrial properties deal with such a thing I think that BPA lines can go over parking lots so we know that employment land likes big rectangular pieces of property that are flat and so I see that you're doing a good job of trying to try to do that but we'd love to see if you have some typologies that show how you can fit in and flex industrial or other types of typologies that you expect to happen here given uh that challenge of the BPA line so thanks okay U Scott Moore do you have some comments on that you've done industrial projects in your power lines supp yeah um you know oftentimes when we're dealing with um large kind of utility easements like that there are there are allowances to do certain things within those easements um whether or not it's maybe um you know maneuvering space for large vehicles or some storage areas but obviously not bu obviously not building so there are things that we can utilize those areas for to uh help support an industrial development it's just wouldn't be building um and Darren From bpa's perspective uh what are you generally comfortable with near your corridors this I was just about to chime in generally what we see is people ask for um water detention pawns uh parking lots um things that they want to get away from using their other buildable land for so um this is a 500 kV line a major line going through there so I I believe should be tall enough even with um uh for like parking lot lights in that type of thing um they'll need to be very careful about planning any vegetation through there if they do parking lots um I know that's always big and I'm trying to do islands and that type of thing but for a big KV 500 kV line that's not looked at very popular um but but for the most most part just think of all those those type of things and um you know where they can build elsewhere where they can have passrs um driving around uh you know all all of that is generally what's what what will get approved through there but you're right no no building in there other than um basically like a 10x10 shed that's about the biggest building they would allow in um any other comments from committee membersa did you have another question or are you still raised one before no I I have another commoner question just um thinking about about it as as um Darren was talking um and I'm I didn't see it on any of these Maps but we we will need and want to reserve um a minimum well probably more like five acres or a little at least five acres for a substation site and so how those lines come in and that's where topology and um elevation and that will make a difference too so we can't put a substation on a um on a slope right so um and then how those lines feed in um you know we we'll have to look at all of that but um just want to make sure we don't forget the need for that space correct um and that's why we have followup meeting of you tomorrow talk about those things and and then they'll be a smarter engineer like person on the phone with me oh perfect yeah and Brian just to clarify I think you mentioned in the beginning but we have a lot of part like CWS Washington County I think the the next meeting is when we're going to get into the all the infrastructure right so there's to me it's like this is this focus on the lot size was a great conversation um the next meeting will be I think probably more important to be honest",

        "text": " for two reasons tonight brief uh briefly both related to the Salem public library first I want to thank uh mayor Hoy councelor Nish councelor vanney councelor nordik councelor Gwinn um and and all those on the committee who are working on a solution to help keep the library open without any further Cuts in the Senate healthc care committee which I chair we've learned of the vital link between literacy and health we must find ways to keep the library open enough hours to accommodate families who are home with children during the day I see them at the library Working Families who come after work I see them then F students who need access to the library in the early evening after they're done with their actor school activities we also must accommodate those who can only access the library on weekends and keep services available for seniors and other vulnerable um adults the second reason I'm here is to pledge that I will continue to work with your leadership to look for funds at the state level as well there are many pressing needs and so thank you for your leadership thank you next we we will have Whitney Hines and Zoe Harper and when you come to the podium please say your name and you're free to say your neighborhood AR award and followed by Whitney Hines and Zoe Harper it will be Kelsey lame and Anthony lame if I'm saying that correct you will follow these two Whitney Hines okay good evening mayor Hoy council members committee members and community members uh my name is Whitney Hines and I'm a resident of Salem Oregon W one Grant neighborhood I am an educator for the school district and the mother of three young children whom my husband and I plan to raise in Salem Oregon four years ago we made the decision to move back to our hometown after spending 12 years living in cities and states across the country we chose to plant roots in Salem where we were both raised and where we saw the value in the community here all of this is to say that I am invested in this city I chose this city and my future is in this city I'm speaking tonight regarding the future the Salem public library like so many others I spent countless hours in the public library as a child one of the few places that was available to me and my friends come rain or shine living in extreme poverty with limited resources and rarely present parents the public library offered me warmth safety access to learning and comfort like so many others I cherish the invaluable resources our library provides members can learn about any topic their heart desires engage in a wide range of activities build confidence grow skills exercise imagination and cultivate a community of educated passionate and valuable citizens public libraries are the Bedrock of society Salem public library offers a safe place for inquisitive Minds to ask questions and seek answers it is one a few places that is accessible to people of all ages socioeconomic status and Mobility it is the bridge between what our children's education can offer and what they deserve I am disheartened by the mere consideration to reduce hours and access or to go as far as to even close the library completely as evidenced in the fiscal year 2025 option three showing no reductions to Public Safety as well as the complete closure of the library performing a brief online search it is easy to find that Salem tax dollars have contributed to paying over $ 4,120 th000 in Salem Police Department misconduct settlements in recent years and that is just what I have found it is logical to assume that is surely more the amount paid in just a few settlements to cover the actions of those who form part of our public safety unit is nearly half of the budget needed to maintain our Public Library however the same preliminary online research shows that our library has resulted in zero dollar paid in settlements with taxpayer money when our taxpayer when our tax dollars not only contribute to funding the police department but also to pay the settlements for excessive force wrongful arrest and sexual misconduct lawsuits then we deserve to have a say in what we believe as a community is an investment fully funding our Public Library please preserve access to information promote Community growth and put our money where it belongs and where it makes a measurable difference I urge you to consider our City's future longevity and livability I urge you to take action to show care creating a welcoming and livable Community please invest in our Salem library thank you Zoe Harper my Zoe Harper I live in W 4 no more cuts to our library please I learned to read myself before kindergarten and I love reading books it's one of my favorite things to do I just love this Library thank you thank you we can definitely clap for someone that's at that you that's probably a future counselor Kelsey and Anthony lame okay hello my name is Kelsey Lamb W 3 I work for the Salem public library but I am not one of the planned reductions the Salem public library SPL is an essential and deeply loved community service yet faces severe cuts for the upcoming fiscal year despite the 2024 fiscal year cuts that reduce Library staff by about 20% despite already being severely underfunded and understaffed compared to all other comparable Oregon libraries and despite that the library only accounted for about 3.5% of the budget by department for fiscal year 2024 the plan proposed to the budget committee suggests removing an additional 7.25 positions from the library which accounts for about 29% of the total Financial Cuts being made why should a department using 3.5% of the budget be taking almost a third of the total budget reductions of the 7.25 FTE Cuts six of these Cuts will result in library staff who have dedicated their lives to serving this community being laid off I had never worked with a whole team so dedicated customer focused collaborative and hardworking as SPL the city would lose a huge asset by laying off these Library staff and that is without considering the ramifications to eliminating our Spanish-speaking Community focused activities and services to our community of almost 30% Spanish speakers additional Cuts will reduce Library Staffing to similar levels of the tmook County Library which has a population 15% of the size of Salem the West Salem Branch will close as indicated by the 2025 budget report and the library will be reduced to likely 25 to 30 open hours per week which is similar to rural libraries with populations under 1,000 people throughout the Tri County Area will suffer from these proposed Cuts due to SPL consisting of the majority of the ccrls Library Consortium which serves Maran poke and Yam Hill counties if we have money to subsidy from the general fund to the airport fund fund and to create five new positions from the general fund for fiscal year 2025 then we should be able to find a solution for the library please support the library to continue serving the Spanish speaking Community to provide digital information access to the over 16% of the Maran County residents without internet connection to provide literacy programs and services to Children 68% of s ker children cannot read proficiently as of 2023 to provide a safe space for everyone and all the other amazing services available through the library people say libraries are magic but the truth is Library staff the magic the community is speaking out in the support of the library by commenting on all social media platforms for post and news articles regarding the library over 100 people came out to a library support rally where hundreds of cars honked in support of the library people are writing and speaking to city council and at the revenue Task Force Town Hall people showcase support for the library through many comments and overfilling boxes with stickers to show their support for funding the library I implore the budget committee to suggest and city council to vote for a solution that eliminates Library Cuts thank you Mr Anthony Lan hello my name is Anthony lamb I work I live in War 3 I'm here today to talk about the 2025 fiscal budget uh pondering this document I found that the city manager was suggesting closing West Salem Branch reducing Library hours of operation and the staff that work there in an attempt to balance the budget at the same time adding more positions to other departments um this proposed budget makes it seem as though City doesn't see Library as essential service which it is and how how can the city say that they're wanting to be transparent and operate on with a good governance at the same time reducing our availability to newspapers and other articles reading that we can actually educate ourselves on what's Happening sorry um yeah just skip El um take your time yeah if the general fund is used to pay for ft positions then I would rather uh see support funds or funds being to support keeping the positions that are currently being held by people being uh coming from other places in the budget um this will allow Salem to maintain the current operations uh and allow people who are already employed from uh make sure they don't lose their jobs this temporary deferral of the budget uh could be refunded later on once the uh Revenue task force comes up with a solution to increase how much funding we get uh through whatever means I am also in support of mayor hoy's uh proposed motion and urge the budget committee to challenge the proposed budget and request that the staff City staff find a option that does not include cutting Library Services thank you thank you next we'll have christe keraj Irene longaker followed by Rob keich and Victoria Tim thank you hi I'm Christy keer Hodge a resident in ward 6 and also the teen Services librarian at Salem public library I did not prepare notes or statistics I just wanted to come and share with you what I have learned um as you may know last week was National Library week it was also the week that six of my colleagues learned that their jobs will be lost if the city managers proposed budget goes through and the proposed Library Cuts happen at least two of those staff are in this room right now um so thank you for coming out while I was helping to prepare for celebrating our library staff um I needed a headcount of how many people work for the library and these are our our regular FTE scheduled nonon call staff there are 37 37 we need need probably at least twice that many to be able to sustain our services that is 37 staff people who work in our library if you've been in that building you know how large it is",

my pleasure yeah honestly a lot of work okay then I will take a motion I'm ready I moved to approve and Order adopting revised Marion County administrative policy number 305 and procedure number 305a protective leave protected leave I'll second emotion we have a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye the motion passes perfect thank you Commissioners thank you okay Brian you're here and we're going to consider approval amendment number five to contract for services and the radio technology services at 122 0.55 for a new contract total of 457 555 to provide project management consulting services the radio communications project between 30th 2025. good morning Brian uh good boarding I'm Brian Nicholas Marion County Public Works director um yep we uh Marion County uh Public Works were in the process of constructing new county-wide radio um that will uh well uh it's it's for the use by the sheriff uh juvenile Services Public Works um and we'll have all the capacity needed for uh first responder agencies throughout the county to also operate on that system and we are through the preliminary design phase and we are ready or just about ready not quite there yet but just about ready to issue an RFP for procurement of the system all the Deployable radios that go with the system the microwave backbone system that goes that does the data transport the whole big project and we have been you know this Project's been kind of we've we've delivered it in chunks the first one was a lot of research and investigatory work preliminary design a concept development that sort of thing and then we moved into development of the actual that's just about done and the next phase will be the actual procurement of the system procurement and then deployment by the radio manufacturer that's what this amendment does it provides the Consulting Services we need to get us through that procurement process not through deployment of the system but through the procurement process and a large radio system like this the full procurement process might take nine or ten months so it's that's one of the reasons why it's not you'll see from the dollar amount it's not an insignificant level of effort that's included in this in this amendment but um anyway that's the the purpose for the amendment I'm happy to answer any questions you have okay any questions we're getting there Mr Sheriff I mean please and Brian sorry that I didn't think of this earlier but I had in a conversation with one of the Commissioners from Lane County their Sheriff's going up and down the canyon will they be able to have the same system as or be able to communicate within the system if they have uh 7 800 megahertz radios in their vehicles or on their hip they will be able to our Sheriff's Vehicles all of our Sheriff vehicles are equipped with tri-band radios so they can operate on UHF VHF and 7800 so if they can't work on ours we can work on so if we do have a conversation with somebody down there we maybe want to just make sure that they're aware of what we're doing so yeah we'll follow up with that thanks Brian when do you expect this to go out to bid well right now I'm the bottle deck on on finalizing the procurement documents I think we are probably about four weeks from advertising okay and then that's usually a six-week process four-week process no this is this is a pretty involved procurement process the plan will be to issue a single RFP but we have six major pro project components okay so proposers can propose on all six you know there's the big radio system there's a subnet there's a microwave system and then there's all the Deployable assets and then there's installation okay so um the uh proposers can propose on all six and and propose deliver the whole thing they can propose on pieces we'll be we'll use one RFP to uh to execute up to six contracts for full delivery of the system um and these typically involve um you know uh technical proposal and uh proposers this is this is not a small thing they're probably going to be looking for 10 12 weeks to prepare that proposal okay and then most certainly there will be interviews as well okay yeah so that's why I say it is typically uh well uh I think this the shortest timeline we should have in mind is about six months okay but they routinely take nine or ten months because the questions raised during the procurement process that's right and then once that's completed then whoever wins whichever parts of the procurement process the bids they'll start work and then that'll take a certain amount of time as well right yeah okay um yeah if we advertise this fall we would be because uh we're looking at a large volume of equipment and with delivery timelines on you know on technology equipment these days advertise this fall means our installation window would be the summer of 2025. yeah okay yeah that's a big thank you for working on this oh everything I mean it's like these are such big rocks to lift up the hill yeah but it's going to have such a massive impact on the safety of our deputies and First Responders so yeah essential it's a must must do yeah all right you ready I'm ready yeah Mr chair I'm literally we approve the amendment number five of the contract for services radio technology Services RTS to add 122 000 55 for a new contract total of 457 555 dollars to provide project management and Consulting service for the radio communications project through June 30th 2025. we have a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye the motion passes all right Brian you're here for the next three so let's just settle in and uh I won't even read them I'll let you I'll let you tell us what we're doing here uh item six once again uh Brian Nicholas Marion County Public Works director um all right uh a little commentary on these purchases I know we've been for the board the last couple of weeks with equipment purchase requests and um you know usually these get spread out more over the course of the year but being that the now that we're at the start of the fiscal year and with vehicle and Equipment delivery being so unpredictable we have moved all of our equipment to purchases as early in the fiscal year as we can to get them in the queue so that's why you're seeing a big you don't usually see",

        "text": " area um and uh and we can go from there and I guess for for I suggest we take one sorry go ahead yes I was going to say for overall purposes um thank you rob for sharing that and then sharing it if we can remind uh everyone the kind of background of purpose of these research committees and helping Advance the city's uh climate action plan um and I think you have a slide Rob uh that you could share that kind of talk looked at the various priorities that we considered um and uh and can share that I I up I could also pull up the U the memo you wrote in March that is kind of the committee charge um that that up that that that works Dylan did you want to see the slide is helpful I would I would recommend we start there because it's easy to read um in terms of starting with one spot and just giving Zach and Mauricio just a quick overview of kind of the 10 categories that we talked about um if if that's all right and then I mean I can give a quick overview from my perspective since I was on the climate action plan if that's helpful as well perfect let's do that me a moment um well I Rob once we once we go through that if you do have the memo um that's available that might be helpful just to um remind folks that that's out there and as a way to kind of hone in on what the charges are for each of the Committees yeah so I can I can just give a a really short overview and I'll just give a quick um note to everyone I do need to leave by 2:15 at the latest today so I have a little bit of a time constraint and I know we're right at capacity so that might hit us on a quorum issue so once we get someone recruited um just want to flly that so just as a a update from my perspective um when I was chair I was able to serve on the climate action plan task force uh as as on behalf of sprb and so I was able to be part of a 43 or so person group um there's a whole section on natural resources that includes a lot of Park issues in the climate action plan I think a a challenge that most of us on the climate action plan committee not or noticed is maybe a lack of initial connectivity between topics so if we're talking about transportation that actually also impacts parks of how do people get to Parks if we think about bikes you know having bikes be part of Park infrastructure things like that and so it's been really exciting to have Juliana come on board in the city um as an opportunity to add staff capacity and weight and emphasis to kind of bringing these ideas together and so I think it was February Juliana you presented to sprb um talked about some of your work and these were the 10 or I think 10 or so issues that came up as kind of priorities to think about for sprad and so um Zach and Mauricio we've been thinking more and more in recent years about how sprb is how sprb members can look at examples from other cities um pull in kind of big questions and use some of our our capacity to help SI help City staff um think about these opportunities and kind of bring in public input and all these other aspects so we broke this up into different categories um I have the first three so kind of the transportation bucket alternative transportation plans to Parks Bike Share hubs and parking design standards um what Rob just shared and unshared at the start there was kind of what I've started working on and so Al Holland is part of my group I know he's not able to be here today um and so that I can kind of go into that in a minute but overall we've broken this up into three different committees for us to start researching work with each other to come back with some recommendations um I think we're we're targeting October time frame October November December to present back to sprb and all this is hopefully going to help Juliana um and coming up with some new ideas and really implementing a lot of this work so it's very much a staff engagement opportunity it's an opportunity to kind of bring this um forward and make Parks be Central to climate action work in Salem so and Rob uh can you go ahead and share the the memo and I will also recognize that Al Holland has joined the crew greetings Al yeah I think that's a good transition Point Dylan and looking at the the Committees and what the assign are in charges knowing that with our member transition the committee rosters have also changed a little exactly um so Rob's pulling that up I think but Keith I don't know if you wanted to just talk about the charge or if you think I covered enough of it oh there it is I think you covered it and this will um specify a little bit more that's why I wanted this pulled up because I wasn't going to be able to remember the specific charges for each one um uh but this kind of gives background information on um and maybe Rob we can resend this out to the group after the meeting as well if we have if Zachary and Mauricio haven't seen it uh but the various groups there we've got three different groups as Dylan said and so uh Dylan's Group C there working Transportation uh and so looking at various policies there Joan and Debbie and Naro are on electric equipment use uh and Allan um Alexander and uh Woody who's no longer on the board we're looking at kind of material using capital projects and low Cur materials so um what could that look like uh and if you can scroll down a little bit Rob I think I had a timeline in there and so here's kind of what we're looking for specifically for deliverables is um those recommended policies and practices um and a report that that looks at that some of the pros and cons um and we are looking at kind of the October through December time frame um scheduling specific Comm for each uh month October November December um there any questions uh specifically from Zachary Mauricio about kind of these various committees and and the charges and what we are trying to accomplish and setting them up can we get that email out to me or that just that document just so I have time to or I can review it further I mean I'm sure we're going to get Mar so I'm sure we're going to get assign a committee today or pick one so I mean it would be good to just see that and have it written for us I think actually Rob gave us one of those at the beginning but it'd be good to have that electronically have it now okay um yeah if we can resend that um at some point uh Rob that' be you SW them up we get it right right now to you Zachary but yes we will definitely get you a copy that um anybody uh Bill and Debbie Al any questions did that all J with your thinking and what you can recall up to speed I met with Debbie yesterday and she did give me that document which I have printed out here um so at least um been introduced to um these projects I do have a you know questions but I guess one it's our term you know to chat about what I was briefed on by Debbie um then you know I can jump in and give some thoughts on on at least our topic cool and thank you Rob I see you just sent the link out to the online document so Zachary you can access it there um and that is you know saving server space and emails I guess so well done um uh okay with that uh Dylan let's um kick off with uh your committee um and uh on on Transportation elements um that you and Al have worked on uh and um you know if you can take maybe we'll do 10ish minutes kind of a ballpark time estimate for committee and kind of a limit see where we're at um at that point just make sure we have time for for each person to get through knowing I guess that we don't have Allan here to talk about his particular one so take it away Dylan please make me stop I am happy to um I guess yeah that was my question is I want to make sure I'm not fully monopolizing everything with some of these questions and so um Juliana I guess I would just offer and to all staff I can can of walk through some of these and Rob I don't know if you can pull this up again that'd be great um but it'd be some of these there might be a good answer in discussion and then others if you feel like it's more of a technical thing maybe it's just you can follow up with an email to me on some of these as well and that would be totally appropriate um Al just a flag for you I know I emailed these to you um a while ago and then it turns out there was an updated email address so I just sent them to you again today so I don't know if you've had a chance to look at these but hoping that you and I can dive into this in more depth moving forward um I guess Al I'll just ask you have you had a chance to look at them and knowing it's fully okay if you haven't just because of the email issue I have not I've not received that document because of the email okay apologies for that confusion um so this you should definitely add in all of your own thoughts um both verbally today and then afterwards so I'll just start going through and then Keith if at any point you want to kind of redirect how I approach this let me know and I'll make it most useful for the group so I am hoping to really dive into some of this more um but where I'm at right now is taking each of these and I've brok it out into three categories of questions for staff examples from other cities and then um some general ideas I have and the examples from other cities I think I was I was waiting on a little bit to get some more information from Staff first um so I didn't start looking for bad examples from other cities so in terms of alternative transportation plans to Parks I was trying to get a better sense um of what kind of conversations have happened with chariots uh about Park promotions route advertisements around Parks really integrating that um I know we talk a lot about Park plans of having bus routes close by and I'm it's not always clear to me how much we have in terms of",

        "text": " of the the idea that we put for forward to the governor's office and one thing I want to be really clear about is that's where we are in the phase on our legislative Concepts right now right now we've shared our ideas for legislative concepts with the governor's office and we don't yet have a red light a green light a yellow light on any of those we're just waiting to hear back um so it could be that they decide we're not going to move forward with this concept but for now since we are we did put it forward we wanted to be really transparent with you and really take a minute to get feedback from you all about the idea um right now every project under C must have a renewable energy component and at least 50% must have a resilience component and the possible legislative concept we put forward is that up to 20% of funds could support resilience only projects and this also dovetails with our um our recent County um energy resilience planning grants that we have and it also dovetails with Federal funding and I'll tell you a little bit more about each of those so right now just opened up a program where every county in the state can do a energy resilience plan and we'll provide a grant to help support crafting that plan this passed in legislation in 2023 and I believe it was House Bill 3630 and then when those plans are done they in some they in many cases will include ideas for projects to increase resilience and there's not a pot of money that's available for such work that's out there now um at the state level at least there are some related programs there's a resilience hubs program at at um uh at the uh Department of Human Services but it it does it's the amount of money is like not that great it'll probably be expended pretty quickly things like that so the idea that we had was to oh and then the other piece of it has to do with Federal funding and consumer own utilities there's a grid resilience program from the federal um federal government that actually has a a match of 33% for resilience projects for the utilities to meet so they can get access to a lot of federal funds that could help them complete projects to help with safety in their communities to help keep the lights on um in the first place but they can't access those funds without a 30% match and we have a lot of consumer and utilities where like raising that 30% match is a real barrier so it means they won't be able to take advantage of the federal program and so we thought we could potentially take a look at this idea of um offering up to 20% % of the funds to support those resilience only projects to serve both the needs of counties and communities served by those counties um for ideas for resilience projects after planning grants and to help with that match issue that some of our smaller cus are experiencing with the grid resilience Federal funding program so that's the basic pitch here why we were thinking about doing this um really um hopefully we've gone through that in enough detail that it makes sense but I really want to hear your questions and comments so that time is now I actually don't have to go anywhere I'm planning to be on the call so I'll be here for the public comment later but I just think while it's fresh before we dive into the rules and like let the two things get confused I thought it might be helpful to just talk about any questions or concerns and I know we've got I think four members of our advisory committee on the line Shannon's got her hand up and we just love to hear from you um so with that I'm happy to hear from Shannon and then open the door to anyone else thanks chrisy am I coming across okay perfectly it's nice to hear your voice okay cool um yeah thanks I'm I'm glad we popped in I guess my my my knee-jerk reaction is just thinking back to the Inception of this program which was as a very very very modest um cutout that was negotiated through HB 2021 so that we had some certainty about funding directed specifically to renewable energy projects within our boundaries um and that was coming out of a a long um an arduous and sometimes negotiation um just about uh how how any certainty would be brought to HB 2021 for projects to be built in state so given the that it you know BR broader framework and history and also so the knowledge that there are it is a very aggressive and competitive active grant program um I'm I'm feeling some concerns um about redirection any of redirecting any of those critical funds away from Renewables specific yep good to hear that Shannon I think that's in part why we're looking at taking a chunk of the money money and not having it compete alongside or you know make sure that we still protect the vast majority of the funding for those purposes of course but um we'd be open to hearing if there's like ideas about lowering maybe it's 10% or something like that um I me we're open to any ideas but um definitely hear that point I want to maintain that it's a renewable energy program and um and resilience and not move it or shift it from that but I I totally hear you and competition for the funds is a real thanks yeah thanks anyone else have any questions or concerns well I'm happy to move things forward but my door is open um to ideas for I guess I I maybe should have said this part out loud too kind of two things on this um that I didn't say all loud that were considerations for us bringing this idea forward in add to just sort of the um like the oh the ones that are like closest to the actual like here's issues we have with the program how up um one thing is we were planning we were thinking about bringing this as a new program and it seemed to us to be a lot more efficient to like nested into an existing program that's successful and has infrastructure and serves many of the same pop same groups already so I think that we'd be interested in like you know potentially more funding for the program to help with this or something like that to to kind of make it pencil um so that it doesn't feel like a loss to the Renewables Community but um we're just trying to think about like a separate program it's just I think a lot of us now in recent years have been through the process of setting up um new programs and it is just so so much work and sometimes it feels like almost inefficient like why don't we just have like one heat pump program why do we have two for example um so I think that's another reason we were thinking like this serves the same audience we are have things up and running could we fold this in so um so just know that that's on our radar too so like if they're um I think we don't there's like no way to say like let's not move the LC unless we know what the budget is because that doesn't really like work with the legislative timeline but that if we could that's how we would do it you know what I mean if that makes sense like if there's more money then we could put it here and only 20% of it you know so um anyway yeah oh Jenna is saying we have three heat pump programs that the department of energy um I think we have two but we'll have three soon um oh in Oregon we have way more than three in Oregon I'm eligible for eight in my house in southwest Portland so yeah it's like kind of wild it's it's frustrating really frankly all right um but with that I'm happy oh Audrey's got her hand up now hey Audrey how's it going hi I had a suggestion of um something else that I wanted to bring up but I don't know if this it's not related to this specifically but I didn't know um I didn't see on the agenda when the best time for me to go ahead and do that would be I'm fine with you doing it now does it relate to like something that would legislative I'm not sure okay let's hear it so I'm with PGE and the grant requires um letters from the utility to be submitted with the applications and we got kind of a avalanche very last minute letter requests that was very um administratively challenging and onerous and I was wondering if there was any way that we could put language suggestions I don't know if it has to be a requirement but just some advanced notice on the information people can give have to give utilities and how much advanced notice they need to provide to get that because we have to do um interconnection reviews which can require like desk engineering reviews and we just don't do that at the snap of a finger yeah Audrey the um within within our rules we ask the applicants that they can show consultation uh with the utilities about the project it doesn't uh necessarily have to be in this letter format we can even we're even accepting emails Communications that this is going on kind of pre kind of precursory communications uh I think a lot of applicants uh a lot of applicants have almost assumed as if they were supposed to get an official letter from uh from their utility which is where we wind up with that Avalanche that's come in because it is required to show that consultation uh I'm glad that you brought it up there's some other pieces about this that the program team we're going to be addressing uh once we get through this sort of crazy period before we move into subsequent rounds we're actually going to move into trying to look into that providing some clar ification uh on some of the items based on what was required in Statue because this was actually a statutory requirement this consultation that made it into the rules but there was never any specified guidance of how that had to come in and we've done a lot to go to go deeper into our other required items to create that guidance and based on this round and and subsequent rounds we definitely see the need to go and try to re uh try to respell this out a little bit better for applicants on what we're looking for vers what the utilities can even provide at this point in time in a project cycle as when it comes to the feas yeah and we're happy to do it and it's actually pretty useful on our side to receive information ahead of time but maybe um like a a form or something like that to just kind of guide what is me what information is wanted from you guys because um they're not doing",

        "text": " to use just less energy that is a good strategy towards this conservation in general so we have some bills there um and people may be interested at the beginning of the session there are a handful of bills account for that were related to nuclear power um none of them moved out of committee one had a public hearing it was HP 2215 that bill would have removed the requirement for a national Repository for the waste as a precondition for approving a new nuclear power plant in the state and it would also have removed the requirement for individual projects we've sent to a vote of the people the bill itself one of that requirement that the electors of Oregon people of Oregon vote on the bill uh it had to hearing but didn't get a committee as well so that will not end this I'll leave it at that and then the last slide is really about just what we talked about a little bit earlier was to get the conversation going about the future meeting uh we met the first week of October last fall I think it's a good um you know it's right after the close of the fiscal it's the start of the new fiscal year so our budgets get refreshed so we've got some money to spend which is nice um and it seemed like a good time of year to be in either the Richland area or Northeast Oregon um I have thought the board's talked about this before that we can get a tour of the B reactor which is now run by the parts of magical Park Service I think that would be pretty cool I've been there before but it's been a number of project times but it's really a an amazing experience to go see to be reactors so that's that's a proposal and meeting the meeting either in Richland or maybe in Hermiston Northeast Oregon on how the board sees whether it wants to go back into the Tri-Cities area or stay in Oregon on our side of the of the Border there um but in the local communities I'd say at harvested in the ad motels with images reports so that's the end of my my presentation here and board business is taxes by Cuba where are your numbers okay Thanks Max uh so the first topic here was a little bit of discussion on the board process for commenting on Hanford issues so uh most recently this analysis of Alternatives we submitted some comments on that and uh our our approach to this point has been pretty kind of ad hoc so what I what I would like to proposed to the board is that basically anybody on the board can identify an issue that thinks the board should comment on and then we will uh format you know a work group of you know however many people two or three or four people that are interested in doing a review of the issue and putting together some advice now that problem is usually the the time frame on this sort of thing can be fairly short and or in the case like the analysis of Alternatives you've got a 400 page document that people need to review at least parts of it so anyway open for discussion does it does that sound like a a reasonable a reasonable approach uh this is Mary Lou and I think we should have some kind of uh design or plan on how we will do this in the future all the documents we want to comment on are very long and we usually do have a long period of time to review them although most of us put it off until the last minute and then it becomes rushed but we do need a way to do this because um you thank you very much Jeff have taken the most of the burden of this over the last few months thank you for putting together that comment letter last time but um it shouldn't have to be just you and you shouldn't have to receive scattered comments from the board in the last few days that you have to put it together so I I would support having some kind of subcommittee formed as soon as we hear comments being invited what I provided Jeff with a copy of the bylaws which I've got Vector copies because we did look at to see where it fit into the bylaws and then also open those up for Ken for any historical the information related to the Past activities in the board right through that best practices it's not a consensus sport is it yeah uh I guess one thing I just throw out just to keep in mind is is everybody has different interests and sometimes the interests really don't fall within the purview of the sport and so either Jeff or Max or both of you guys need to say maybe that doesn't quite fit with what the board should be commenting on even though there might be a strong interest in it so we need to watch for that but you know Jeff I agree with Mary Lou Jeff has has really taken it on uh so far and it shouldn't fall solely on him when we get to the whatever comes out of the uh ballistic I I will certainly am interested in participating in that review and combine comments but so I I think Ken is right that that's the next uh big shoe to drop so to speak is the uh the holistic negotiations um if you are interested in participating and putting together the comments uh just let me know and I'd be more than happy this time we're going to take a back seat on it um moving on the uh last week we sent a invitation letter out to the members of the Oregon Congressional Delegation inviting them to come and talk to the board and visit Hanford um next fall we didn't provide any dates we're kind of uh we're fishing for interest and depending on upon the response then we will work with people on this board as well as the the try party agencies to to put something together so that's let's see five congressmen and two senators 50 senators and so far have gotten a response back from representative blumen Alabama sorry I keep saying balloon blooming hours office that that they're very interested so a follow-up is necessary and they let people do it so hopefully that will come together in the next month or so and again these that issue in the next one on this list are kind of priorities that we'd identified early this year so the next one is we've talked we've opened conversations with the University of Oregon environmental Sciences Division and Earth Sciences Division and Oregon State University's nuclear engineering department about uh putting together a seminar or a lecture series and so we've we've put together a whole laundry list of 20 or 25 different topics um we've talked to the agencies in Hanford everybody's interested in participating I'm sure Kim if they're interested in the history of Hanford that you might participate in that but basically that we're targeting at least for Oregon State University something to happen next fall with University of Oregon maybe next fall or maybe next spring but we're trying to see what they're interested in and then provide speakers that could come in and Slot into their curriculum for what we're calling at this point a lecture Series so if it's you know Earth Sciences or environmental probes that sodium might be requested to go in for example and talk about hydrogeology of the science good morning truth inside that so we're it's early on if you're interested in any uh way shape or form and let me know I'm I'm like the little kid in the barn full of star playing with matches I'm trying to get something started and then I'll turn it over Mary Lou yeah uh I think what we did today in talking as a panel or having a panel discussion about interest in returning the site to Citizens is very good but it would really be edifying to have some legal legally informed person brief us on what laws or precedents apply to situations like this I you know as a citizen representative board we did what is a good thing to do today but it would really be much the next step is to find out what is possible legally and I know there are laws that pertain the deposition of lands back to tribes but I don't know how they would apply here and I'll bet there are authorities in the law schools of Oregon that would that could have some opinions schools right okay thanks we'll add that to the list of topics one of the things one thing that all the laundry of topics we were going around was about like legislative and Regulatory stuff thinking about political science departments universities that might be interested in talking about that angle as well as well as engineering right I have a quick clarifier uh on the organ about being the representatives to come was that this year 2023 or next year 2024. this year this and fall that's the kind of one which is all you do ideally if we're at Hanford the first week of October that's when we would like to see it happen so one thing that keeps on coming to mind uh that isn't hasn't been talked about yet is the the record permit for the site that's going to be coming out january-ish right that's the current schedule of early 2024. oh so it might be worth uh having some conversations about what that is it's a you think 400 pages is thick I'm not going to read that one um what if we had 12 000 Pages or twenty thousand plus Pages more than 20 000 pages of record permits alone and uh that's going to be uh a big one and it's gonna you know it's gonna be an elephant that we're gonna have to you know take the birth bite of at some point um not that we won't eat elephants but yeah so uh we should probably walk a little bit of time just to get an introduction to that okay um so we're ready in January day that's good very that's a good one to defer to the professional staff that the the the board the board can direct us to do that research if they'd like Ken's idea yeah I'll summarize it um any other comments before uh we move on to yes Florida okay I was just going to say back to um the position letters that we send out the one about the analysis of Alternatives letter I mean I I honestly didn't feel prepared to weigh in on it and that's that was just that was sort of unpleasant I think I even emailed you I did not understand and um you know I guess that's that's my responsibility to a degree but really I'm not usually totally clueless about something and that just had me baffled it could have been the day I read it I don't know but I think a subcommittee or Sun preparation for these letters before they go out so that so then I uh you know understand you know what",

        "text": " for microgrid projects to aggregate and bid into wholesale energy markets potentially providing a new pathway to develop these resilient one commenter however noted or believes that it is quote unlikely that an rto would be a form that would promote and then on the issue of wildfire nexus mitigation versus impacts unlikely that an rto could be designed to do much to mitigate wildfire risks but it must be designed to take into consideration how wildfire could impact operations and diversification the diversification of resources geography and alternate paths that an rto may make viable can help to address the risks posed by wildfire to the power system common standards and practices and rto can improve situational awareness and support the development of common standards and practices such as for operational measures like public safety power shut off during high wildfire risk transmission development while an rto is unlikely to mitigate wildfire risks to the extent it supports additional transmission development and rto could alleviate constraints that would otherwise occur due to past game impacted by wildfire and then our discussion questions um so again do you support or oppose particular perspective would you emphasize something differently is there something missing and the two new questions i'm throwing out there again while rtos aren't a tool to solve all the problems of the industry to what extent should considerations of climate resilience be essential to evaluation of rto formation and community resilience given our rapidly changing climate how important is it to future energy markets like those that would be operated by an rto provide a pathway to the development of ders that can improve community and i didn't get my prompt there to navigate to the hand raise function but if you have comments there it asks that you use the n-raise function to let me know it's possible everyone's just excited to get to governance which is next okay i'm happy to move on if we don't have any uh anyone who wants to weigh in on comments here i know some of the distributed energy resources um touched on some of these questions kind of in the previous question so um oh all right and now there are uh i see uh we'll go to representative marsh first and then to orianna i think you're on mute representative thanks i put that video on but not the moon um so this is such a great uh conversation i'm and i very much come to this from a policy perspective and not a technical perspective but given that i think um climate resilience is the most important thing in front of any of us and we have to um certainly as a as a policy maker i would want to understand how the rto nurtures or interacts with questions around climate resilience i don't think we can do anything without those considerations um and then in terms of community resilience i just want to note at the same time odo is doing this study you're also charged with looking doing a study on community energy projects um we are gathering information through hbe 2021 from the utilities on the development of local projects we are investing 50 million dollars into local projects to try to get some experience the benefit of multiple benefits of those and ways to calculate that in terms of dollar terms so um all that is to say i think community resilience is of extraordinary interest to our communities and in the couple of years i think we'll actually start to get some very tangible understanding of both those benefits and and how you put a financial value on them that could be important for this thank you for that feedback yeah i just want to echo uh everything representative marsh just said i think it uh i'm sure it doesn't come it's a surprise that based on my previous comments uh we strongly support figuring out how an rto can provide that pathway to development of ders and valuing of ders in a regional system we see that as really essential to community resilience that having a variety of different energy sources and is important to a balanced energy diet but i think there's also the bigger consideration when we look to some of the fires in california just the risks associated with large transmission systems and some of the challenges that have shown up in oregon related to the plan safety power shutoffs so i think really making sure that communities are are micro gridded that there are ders online are really important way to address the the times in our system when uh transmission needs to be shut off uh to to address fire risk but i think within that there's also the opportunity that you can have the dual resiliency benefit but then also the dual wealth building uh benefit for community or the dual balancing benefit for for community that can come from from really looking at the interaction of our distributed energy system and our our transmission system great thank you for that um next i see spencer's hand thanks adam i i just wanted to provide a few thoughts responding to representative marsha's comments and questions about climate i think there's a lot to be said about community resilience and we've covered some of that in terms of how rtos provide a platform for and a market signal for more distributed development resources but on a bigger scale climate resilience i guess i would turn your attention and um legislators attention to how spp and iso fared during the winter storm this past year versus how texas fared and i guess i provide this example with a little bit of caution um the northwest uh was designed for inter-regional transfers we've got transmission lines that were designed and financed with a view towards moving power between british columbia the northwest in the us and california and the so we do have a system that was set up in a bilateral context to move power a thousand miles of the west but the example of the winter storm i think was illustrative that both spp and had some blackouts they had a really challenging time an extreme weather event that is what we expect more of with climate change but they did not have the outages that texas experienced and one principle reason for that was they were far more able to share neighboring resources with each other and for neighbors to share each other's neighbors resources with each other and that adjoining neighbor and a neighbor step removed function is something that rtos do i think in a more optimized way than any other system and texas was exhibit a of having an asynchronous system isolated in a single very large state that lacked that functionality so you might consider the northwest being sort of in between those two systems and having contract based transmission rights that don't optimize neighbors sharing neighbors resources in the kind of wide area extreme weather events that climate change is going to make this is already making more um uh persistent thank you and i saw representative marshall your hand is still raised and i saw you pop back on the camera i didn't know if you had a follow-up comment or not but if you didn't wanna didn't want to skip over you sorry just bad hand management no problem and uh see no other hands raised and i know we have two big topics to come i will move those on to question 10 um so obviously this is a topic that's been kind of woven throughout our discussion uh both today and a couple weeks ago that there's a need for effective governance of any rto that would ensure oregon's perspectives are adequately um so we're looking for feedback here on priorities or principles that should be whether they're best practices from other regions potentially new practices that don't exist that maybe would be how to protect state interests and then principles so in terms of best practices um multiple commenters not surprisingly uh suggested that the governance proposal is being considered by the power poles western ra program um and there's ample material out there on that are a good reference for best practices that would be applicable to an rto state involvement meaningful state involvement in rto governance was identified quote as a key to a well-functioning rto and stp's regional states committee and the eim's body of state regulators were both cited as examples member involvement one commenter noted that svp has quote a strong member participation model of governance which member engagement to develop rules and diverse perspectives one commenter suggested rto governance should incorporate committees or other modes of participation that incorporate diverse involving stakeholders and a nominating committee to select board members being identified as one such mechanism and the need for balance it will be quite important to balance the need for public stakeholder input with the needs of participating entities when designing rto governance structures uh best practices continued here um one commenter identified some unique uh strengths of two competing rto governance models spp and eim uh in terms of spp the model has been effective in allowing for growth and expansion to encompass multiple states and regions the independence and flexibility of its governance structure should be replicated especially with regards to its transparent decision making eim the use of a nominating committee representing diverse stakeholders to select eim board members may be worth uh western ein the reservation of ultimate decision making with the kaiser board of governors which is appointed by the california governor with the fiduciary responsibility for california ratepayers is a fundamental element of ein governance which makes it unworkable for an rto svp one commenter suggests that an rto should have quote prioritized representation for rate payers and customers who ultimately pay for the rto product and that the spp's model in this regard should quote be unacceptable excuse me protecting states interests market design rto market design should not occur without significant support from participants and the state as appropriate design cannot mitigate an rto from quote overriding state policies similarly one commenter suggests that an rto design should include protections designed to retain and or not preempt state and local decision making to the extent possible ghg accounting rto formation should require quote compliance with current and future state agency policies regarding ghg accounting requirements one commenter noted that different state carbon and renewable rules can quote significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of an rto that and that aligning state policies could mitigate this was a comment i think i already had earlier but meaningful state involvement in rto governance was identified as quota key to a well-functioning rto uh ferc engagement states should intervene in proceedings related to the development of markets where the proposed governance structure does not meet the needs of the state including obtaining section 205 filing rights state regulatory and legislative requirements if properly designed should not result in conflicts between rto operation and utility compliance with those requirements and then uh governance principles sort of wrapping all this up uh independence something we certainly talked about uh the previous transparency stakeholders and board processes should be fully transparent technical competence there should be",

        "text": " looking at that harder but a general question I had with respect with respect to the what response do we know that the the responsibility so these are many of these projects are on private lands or most most of these are on private land um that the landowners are receiving um lease payments um from the developers do we have any idea what's in those agreements as to the agreements they have to return the site that's used on a particular um owner's property that's leased um to a usable we're not a part of those contracts we know we're not a party to them but it it distracts me as pretty interesting that that is a two-party transaction that we're not involved in yet we're uh responsible for the cleanup of those if the person that made that agreement is no longer there so I just think that's a bit unusual Isis you know were I would look at it from the other perspective and if I'm the landowner or the uh the developer I don't necessarily want that document to be public why do why do we need to know know the terms of that agreement the financial terms in particular what we need to know is that they have a good plan in place that we're comfortable with the plan and that they've provided the advocate of financial Assurance to require the facility if we have to step yeah and I I'm not suggesting we do anything different my inquiry was do we um and I guess partly because the landowners are now um really relying on us right should something go bump in the their Reliance is on us to ensure the cleanup happens on their property which they leased correct and they potentially have their own private contractual yeah based on their contract that they they separately from what we're yeah I I understand it was just an inquiry about if you know you guys are close to it every day so just wondered if you if you knew if there was anything in those contracts related to this I have not seen one of those I've only seen some description of those those contracts in the article about the big old Canyon uh situation I I learned there was some discussion of the to my knowledge we don't ask for that and as I discuss I don't think we need yeah I'll just validate that that uh we that's not part of our requirements and those are not voluntarily given to us so um you know other than outside of what Patrick just referenced on big little canyon I'm not aware of us ever seeing um that kind of information okay and just um one more question from he Todd is there any conversation has there been any conversation with uh landowners in uh the past who are they relying on our organizational expertise review at all you know some of them may not have the some people just may not go through a review process of of the um company that's Leasing Property from um and are instead relying on us have you heard anything um about that uh not specifically no I mean I would say that you know probably in the abstract uh yes that there's a regulatory process we we oversee that regulatory process and that's included in there so you know kind of I would say just you know implicitly yes but but we certainly have had no conversations with landowners you know who you know come to us and say Hey you know are you guys making sure that you know the people that are proposing to construct on our property have all of this organizational expertise to you know build own and operate and uh I mean ultimately retire it consistent never had that conversation okay thank you and just one more question for you Todd I'm guessing that the vast majority if not all that I've seen um of the projects in the last certainly five years maybe 10 years are llc's do you have any um idea what that breakdown um how many are llc's and where they are organized where they are Incorporated I would say the I mean you know we we have the investor-owned utilities have you know submitted some projects or taken over some projects you know Portland General Electric took over one of the Wheat Ridge kind of split um projects so the vast majority have been the independent power producers you know with single purpose uh LLCs I don't know what the exact breakdown is but I would say certainly majority of those are that way and I've I have not I have to go back and look but I have not uh to my recollection seen one of those llc's that was not filed in Delaware so I would say it's a good guess to say that they all have been filed in Delaware but but I again would have to go back and verify that okay and I do think it's important that we remember there's a reason for that there's a reason for filing in Delaware as opposed to Oregon and whatnot so um anyway thanks for the presentation so so Madam chair before we leave this agenda item I just want to make sure that we have a staff clear Direction on moving forward um to make sure that everybody's you know the council is clear that we're clear on what if anything you'd like us to do I think there was a good conversation about some some recent changes that we've made to findings and conditions and it sounded like that there was interest in kind of continuing those maybe some changes to those um and we can certainly do that and make sure that we take note of that for future findings we also talked about rule making so where we're at with the rulemaking is uh at least where this would fit in uh where our current rule making structure and schedule is is that we have the rule making alignment you know we have the phase one currently going on that's a fairly non-substantive and sort of moving some um you know requirements uh rules around phase two will be similar it will be non-substantive or largely non-substantive with just sort of a repackaging when we get into phase three and phase three is really a set of rule making it's not going to be one rulemaking it will be where we start to tackle uh individual or groups of standards and so this is where we would look at this right now unless you know Council wanted to identify this as a specific rulemaking so again I wanted to kind of tee that up to say you know what's your interest you know in you know this conversation whatever the outcome may be through rule making and what is your prioritization to that so it would currently be in that phase three we have not identified any kind of prioritization of those standards or group of Standards so you know looking for some feedback to say if you did want us to tackle this in rule making you know where would you want us to put this in that phase three rulemaking would it be at the top in the middle at the bottom you know what would your preference be thank you Council I will ask if anyone has any thoughts to share before I offer any if I do anyone have any comments questions to Todd's inquiry continue this is Cindy um and as you might imagine Cindy Condon to me this is a priority um issue that organizational expertise we as I said you know we have done quite a bit of work with the retirement and financial Assurance piece which has um you know it will evolve as continue to evolve but the organizational um issue the evidence of organizational expertise uh to me is an important um issue for issuing the site certificate and um to me that's the first standard standard and other than the general standard of review but um and that um sufficient we sh I think we need to say what the evidence is or certainly what evidence should be provided as a parent and look at the questions that um actually Patrick had in his slides uh with respect to co-applicant or whatnot and how we really review if somebody's relying on a parent company um how we incorporate that in our organizational expertise review so I I to me it's a high priority thank you anyone else have comments yeah chair Grail this is Kent I I tend to agree with Cindy on this that um this is dealing with issuing site certificates so I think it deserves a higher priority than maybe some of the other things so that's where I'm coming from thank you council member buyer or talk to either of you have any thoughts this is counselor buyer I'm okay kind of moving slowly on this and improving our conditions I think the way the standard is set which is access to technical expertise is pretty darn broad I'm trying to figure out what documentation we need um is something we'll have to think about I think as Patrick pointed out there is a requirement to provide evidence of that technical expertise at each stage so in the planning and the construction and the operation in the I I think we it is a critical piece of the site certificate but thinking carefully about what that evidence is without being so burdensome in this pretty changing environment so I'm kind of ambivalent thank you if I may this is Patrick again uh that condition I just want to point out that that was a condition that we have included in some recent site certificates but not all and so I think what I'm hearing is that you would like to see that in all of our site certificates where they have to provide that evidence of the qualifications and access at each stage prior to construction prior to operation prior to I think I think that's appropriate knowing that they would that any developer would hire different contractors or different bits of expertise for those components so thank you for clarifying that go ahead Cindy thank you I'm chair girl Cindy Condon um just to speak to that I I understand that technical expertise but to me on the front end and um and this could be argued I suppose um it's the financial resources that are required to to do the project to um even start the project and obviously they can get a bond or we they wouldn't start construction without the bond but um and I'd be maybe incorrect In thinking this but um this site certificate should we issue it has real value and the state of Oregon and landowners and uh people approximate to to the project maybe are relying on on what is presented in that site application and so for me the financial resources and the financial assurance that they'll have the resources necessary to do the development um is an important piece of that expertise because they're telling us when we get a site application we're going to start construction within three um and we have this great plan but if they're not given the financial resources to do it um they have a valuable site certificate that we've issued that doesn't benefit the state of Oregon",

        "text": " the things, what I'm just thinking about also here is there's, and I've somehow or another heard of this somewhere else other than in this room. Those trucks are still going to. Going to come in or somebody's trucks are going to come in to collect the debris that's already in that Marion Oaks and 100% waterways, is it? Or the one anyway, the subdivision to it. So trucks, some trucks of that size are going to be on that road anyhow. And my first thought was, but not daily. So, hey, is there another way? But if you send it out to 484 and then back around a different way, now you've just kind of done the same thing, added the trips. Well, a road like 484 is going to be built different than a local residential road in Marion Oaks. I'm sorry? A road that's in Marion Oaks is going to be very different from something like 484. No, no, I understand that. But you're still going to run those trucks back out and then back through another road as well. Tough call. Got a question. But this is all. This is all a result of new construction, correct? No, sir. There's also tree trimming that occurs on the existing lots with existing homes and that material comes in as well. Yeah, but not to that extent. Damage or whatnot. Not to that extent, is it not? I don't know the percentage. I can't give you the percentage breakdown of tree trim versus tree removal and lot clearing, but it is both. But I would. I would. I would give into your argument that a large portion of it is lot clearing that occurs out there. Oh, yeah, I imagine so. I would not expect it. And it's just unfair. It's unfair. These. These people are paying for that road. If those were county maintained roads, you know, that. That'd be a little different. That'd be quite a bit different. These people got together and they have to pay for those roads. Go ahead. So what is the alternate? The staff is thinking, suppose you denied, then what's the alternate? The debris will be there. Your co reinforcement people will go. If this is denied by. If this is denied by staff, this kind of use cannot take place because it cannot take place in an agriculture zoning. This is an industrial commercial type use that cannot take place in rural land. It cannot take place on an agriculture zoning. It could not get a special use with an agriculture zoning. So my question is, is there kind of operation anywhere happening in a Marion county or any surrounding county and how they tackling this problem? Please, if you have some suggestions. Gassed on tree debris is taking place in a commerce district. Land use with a heavy industrial zoning. That's the right place and the right land use. They're in an area that can support that. You mean to say go pick up the debris and bring it to that site and just burn it? Something like that? Yes. They would have to be finding some place that is located in a zoning and land use that is appropriate for that kind of use, not rural land in a residential area. I did that special use permit for that one, and I believe he's doing. I don't know that that one's even open to the public. I believe he's doing it for his own tree service. So that would eliminate that location as being a site that it could be hauled to. So then the other would be our landfill, which is government use. That's an inappropriate area. The other example that was provided by the applicant was Cypress Acres landfill. That was in an a one zoning. So again, that would not be allowed today based on the Oto settlement that took place. So basically, we would need to be looking for a higher density land use and zoning which would be appropriate with this type of use. And they could do it essentially by right there unless there are some accessory type uses taking place that required a special use permit. So it's just that this is not the right land use or zoning for this. And if you picked one of those land uses or zonings and you put it there, you'd be much. You'd be closer to a much higher population density. And when you're hired of that population density, this room would be filled with people that were against this project instead of for it. And so that's why this makes so much sense. I have a question. Does the applicant own the land or do those who are bringing. I'll ask you. The applicant owns land. Oh, applicant owns land. Number one. Number two, did I just hear you correct that two out of the three of those the general public can't use? Gaston is just taking his own. I believe he's only taking his own material. And then the other one is a government use, though, is open, is our public. But it's open to the public. So there's two of them open to the public. Okay. All right. Just. We've closed the floor to public comment, so we won't be able to hear anything that you have to say tonight. But you'll. You'll be whatever you might have be thinking of. Save for the county commission meeting. Yes, sir. Reading this correct, this is the conclusion provided was expected to produce a maximum of 100 trips per day, up to ten trips due in peak hours. A lot of trucks going into. Yeah, you'll have lot more if you have to pick up and take it to somewhere. It will come one way and then it will go on. I'm just thinking, listen, you're fine. It doesn't matter who you are, which way you do it. Your opinion is your opinion. That's it. And you're welcome. So I'm just wondering, you know, who time tugs. Go. You just can't find these. You can't find these places just anywhere in the county. I got it. But let's just. While we're here, just so that the five six ending, everybody's opinion is equal. You say whatever, you know, whatever your opinion is. Oh, don't worry about it. I will. I'd be nice and you know, don't take my opinion now, guys. No, no, no. It's equal. You ask the right thing. Because we go in and then come out. So it's a double. It will be 200. And they don't need no permit. They just pick up and go. I might. I may save that, Miss Orlewski, if it's all right, for the next one. Just let it, beginning in my speech. Just let everyone know that each, their opinion is valued as much as anyone else. So don't be concerned. All right? Do we? Yes, sir. Mister Heller. Yes. You know, the way I look at it, you know, probably a good site, but you're going to be using the roads in there. That is residential roads, where there's people live. And to me, putting a grinder or incinerator next to the residential, which could be residential, I don't know if there's houses on that road right across, but, you know, you're adding insult to injury. If it's a problem of moving it, the expense, so what? Move it, you know, but get it away from the residential area. Right across from where I live in Hidden Lake. They just cleared a bunch of land for a development. And where did they put the burn pile? Right next to the houses in the back of the property. Not in the center, where it wouldn't have impacted them so much. Those people, some of them ended up in the hospital. Respiratory problems, you know. And the way I look at it, if you're going to be burning waste, you're going to be grinding. Grinding is very loud. My son in law has a grinder. I think this is an incinerator, right? We are not grinding. We're not grinding. I think this is an incinerator. That's what it said here, not just a burn pile, right? And then there's going to be a sale of sand. That's sand mining that we are not mining. The sand is sand that comes in on the trucks with the debris. It gets separated out. So you don't want to put the sand inside your burn pit, because it fills your burn pit up. The ash really compacts. I mean, the ash goes down to almost nothing. So you get to use your pit longer. They take this material, and when they process it, basically, it's like you roll it, basically, and you try to get all the dirt out of it, but dirt comes in with it. So if we keep bringing dirt in and dirt comes in and comes in and comes in, and we don't ever send any of it out, then we wind up with too much dirt. So dirt will be sold off the site. That just happens to come in with the trucks. But we are not grinding the material. We will be taking it, and we're just burning. How are they reducing the material for the incinerator? You don't. That's the reason. So it gets separated. So you have basically the limbs and the tops, and then you have the logs and the stumps. Logs and stumps don't burn as fast. And you want to get your fire started with your tops and your limbs. And so the smaller material, you get your fire started, and then you put your larger material on top once you've got it going to make it fully incinerate. David, can they not ask for the special use permit rather than a permanent. We are not allowed to ask for a special use permit based on the settlement that occurred with on top of the world because of what? So there's",

        "text": "eline monitoring positions that were representative for nsrs or like residences within same acoustic environments right rather than going out and measuring a baseline at each house hundreds of them right we're going to group them together and that was appropriate and we described why and that was litigated so um and that the sound me it's old it doesn't work it's not uh it doesn't contemplate new technology and you know calibration anyhow so we really looked at that um and then the kind of the point with the mitigation and the complaint response plan and I think Patrick I don't know if he's like get getting the shakes over here from from from talking about noise in the contested case but we did and particularly with the conditions it was back and forth and back and forth which finally resulted in the hearing officer's contested case order which after that was issued which that was done of contested case of that a year and 10 months and then parties to the contested case were allowed to file exceptions to that contested case order and so they filed there was a lot of exceptions it was a lot and so we traveled out to LR for three days of full days of exception hearings where we went through all of them um and at one point in time when we got to noise like both department and Idaho Power agreed that the hearing officer maybe missed an opportunity or didn't consider some of their changes to conditions to the noise conditions and so we sat down and so when I say stop B2 was at the table in the development of these conditions it was literally at the table at this exception hearing where we're going through back and forth on the specific language of these noise control conditions so um and we res and we have the conditions that we have um which the only change to the condition for RFA 2 is making sure that the other nsrs that might be implicated are included in the mitigation notification complete response um stop B2 did uh say um with respect to monitoring that we had this one condition and this nco3 it's the one that says the trans Mission Line's going to be let see like triple um and see oh it didn't go uh no no don't have my Sarah that's okay that's fine I'll find it oh oops great and now I just wrote in my stack report okay you know what um I put it in my staff report I don't know if you saw that or not thank you for your patience we're GNA we're GNA this is going to go so fast it's going to go so fast after this okay well this is a condition I I don't want to waste our time and you will see it there it is all right this is from the staff report so it said the conditions said during construction you're going to implement these design features and it's triple bundle your line and then maintain tension on your insulator assemblies and then protect your conductor surface to minimize scratching and nicking so council member delin this is kind of one of those things this is an operate this is a maintenance um condition that probably is already duplicative with other requirements and things that they'll be doing or say that they need to do somewhere else but this was um this was based on their representations and and to me like and looking back at the final order its intent is to be an operational a construction and operation if you're constructing it you're going to construct it with this triple bundled but maintaining tension that's like that's a that's operational that's an operational thing so um we're suggesting just making this rather than a con a construction thing it would just be an OP operational or we would change it to a gen a gen condition which applies to multiple phases and then we also point out like you know that's not it like we we have lots which council member Devin this is also talking about what you kind of what you were talking about right like we talk um it's trans utilities and transmission lines are heavily regulated right so that's regulated by you know nerk has um stand standards and then the opuc and then we have conditions that require compliance with and reporting of outcomes of their transmission maintenance and inspection plan that tmip so we have conditions that require them to report that and so that's also part of your record are all of the representations of operational maintenance in that tmip um and then with respect because B2 talking is talking about you know line sag over time um don't I have it in here maybe it's oh oh yeah uh we also have this uh sighting standards for transmission lines which has minimum ground clearances um for under under um maximum load maximum heat situations where there would be the most line sag so um they just so that's the that's our recommended condition change just to make sure that it's evident that that does indeed apply to construction and operation does anybody have any questions about some noise oh wait wait no yeah no that's yes all right okay noise Make some noise stretch we doing okay do we need a break so excited we're doing okay keep going keep going all right all right um so Wildfire mitigation plan I want to bring this up because I know Council cares about Wildfire we've been talking about it a lot um and this again is unique um uh this transmission line and the application of the rules is unique for this facility why because underneath your Wildfire uh mitigation standard you have a sub one which is what you've been seeing for all of these other facilities and Council has been you've been doing your own um wmp for construction operation right and so we're kind of getting we're and I think we're going to talk about it more and I think we're getting to a good place where we're on the page about what that looks like um and your standard does say that Council May under sub two of the standard if if there is a facility that is you know regulated by pu and required to comply with the Pu wild Wildfire mitigation plan rules that you know Council you don't have to make those findings underneath one basically you adopt their Wildfire excuse me mitigation plan and that's what we suggested is like it's approved they are regulated they are required to do one and there is an approved one and we're there and I would say that they're not I'm not putting down our I I feel comfortable with our welfare mitigation plans for our other facilities but these things are like for transmission lines um and it's not just transmission lines it's it's these are for utilities who have like a whole slew of Assets in the inside and outside of their service territory um under the pu's rules they undergo they have to submit a wmp annually it's basically an in a constant constant review cycle right um so they submit it and and just generally speaking and so this is just like we're maybe in like the third year that their rule has been in place so this is all very new for everybody so if you're feeling like wildfire it's new it's still relatively new for everybody so they do an annual review to where you know and there's lots of it goes into a docket and there's lots of public participation and comments are evaluated very much like we're doing here and respond to Etc and then the staff makes ultimately you know the Pu approves it oftentimes contingent Upon A you know a staff report and recommendations to do blank blank blank in next year's wildare mitigation plan they have t you know the intent of it is to be iterative adaptive um and and and and responsive and so they're in that pipeline so um there are so um I'm I'm having this slide I don't know if you notice these details it doesn't say issues related to I'm just talking to you about like this is just an interest this is your review of the DPO and I just want to talk to you about the Wildfire mitigation plan because it's it's interesting and it's different from what we've looked at for these projects Wildfire was raised by folks particularly like Wendy King and Sam Myers you know and they say our family has concerned that our 2 is not in compliance with the new Wildfire M Mist standard because the line's routed through Butter Creek Wildland Urban interface and Sam Myers says this plan is frankly unacceptable and leaves out significant crop land impacts from fire um I would say I don't know how to respond to either of those you know like it's it's you know it's mentioning a standard but I don't have any don't how is it insufficient I don't know I don't I don't don't understand I don't really have a good way to respond to that Idaho Power provides responses and I suggest that you know just making um weaving in some of their responses into the proposed order just to like again help tell the story um I think uh emailed back and forth with council member IMS about the the wmp and questions with it so um they actually added this right and this is council member delin right so op there was a question about like field compliance does PU actually go out there and inspect the line and yes they do so um Idaho Power kind of clarifies that so opuc annually evaluates the vegetation management programs and every three years inspects vegetation as part of nesc in nesc inspections um and so again and you counil you have uh your own our own you know reporting compliance like um inspections maintenance conditions and all of that gets reported to you and then we have our compliance program where in our rotation we would be going out um one year or more uh to check on various site certificate conditions okay yep ccor Bon just just a quick clarification so for transmission lines we're defaulting to the Wildfire m ation plan developed for the Pu which makes a lot of sense to me and and then um with the uh RFA 2 is there any language there that says that this plan will now include the new site boundary um microid area do we have to make that explicit or we've said do this as part of site to say and by the way that extra stuff you just added is you mean a change to the condition or just in the order um I don't think you need to I don't know if we need to change I don't think you need to change it because in the while in their Wildfire mid right your like our analysis area goes out a you know a half mile I think right we've already approved that right we've already this yeah and then their evaluation and their plan also has this buffer which would be covered in would overlap with your analysis area so I don't I don't think that we would need to change anything",

        "text": " our database um so uh those two and then uh the last item is we will ask for uh your s SP 1149 account balance um at the end of a fiscal year so those are kind of the three things that we typically will reach out um there's additional things like getting the project cost but those are the three main that we typically will follow up with you um once or twice a year um typically that's Tracy so Christina um then the for the Energy Trust of Oregon uh we have our funding um for you know HVAC controls upgrade large type projects are based on cost Effectiveness so we take a look at the project costs and the Energy savings and we do a calculation and will tell us um if you can receive a incentive and then how much of an incentive so we have a little bit of a process to go through that I'll get into more details about but you know not every project will earn an incentive um but uh we find that many do um the incentives once once you complete your project and you've submitted your invoice um we tend to pay we we mail a checkout to you and I will email you we'll email you to say hey there's a check on the way and that's usually within 30 days of the the a receipt of the okay um this is just a quick H slide to show everybody again the new elements with the zero emissions vehicles and Chargers um there's a link on here for our web page um with the information there's a few steps of things that you would do if you want to um request to be able to use your funds for uh a zero emissions vehicle or a charger um these are kind of the up to amounts kind of that s SP 1149 Max reimbursement amount um we just need to work with the district on again a flea audit and some of the forms which we can you know kind of interact um and work with you on um and then we would uh once you've done purchased the item or installed the charger or something like that we'll get that final cost um details and make sure that we're tracking everything so if there's any grants um on those items as well from the utility or just any other federal grants we need to know that so that we can make sure we're not reimbursing more than 100% of the cost um but that's just a uh a little information and again please reach out to me if you have questions about at Fleet audits or zero emissions Christina so 2024 uh there are a lot of changes to our incentives and uh they've all gone up uh it's really great news so this year so the summary is this there's a lot of information here but the summary is this is a great year to do projects um this is not an exclusive list but a list of projects that our districts tend to to work on um I was just going to highlight a few um for you so steam traps the $400 to $500 um if your steam traps are are failing they're failed open um then I have seen this incentive pay for the majority of a project if not all um roof insulation if you're doing any Roofing projects this uh $285 a square foot if it if your ins existing insulation is water damaged or it is uh there wasn't much insulation to begin with you could be eligible and this is one of those incentives that I actually uh can really rack up a large dollar amount so I think my largest one for this last year I gave a check for 175,000 or something like that for one site so that's a big one a big ticket one um pipe insulation I want to mention this $25 a linear foot I have seen a lot of districts take advantage of this if you have any exposed piping this should pay for 100% of the material and labor um and so I would I would definitely recommend if you guys are looking for projects to do that you won't be you'll maybe you have to pay for the project first but at the very least you're going to get all that money back a pipe insulation is a great one to do this year um we have Wall insation we have a the boiler incentive is really good um you know 650 per KPD what does that mean um if you just send me what your new boiler you're thinking of installing or even your name plate of your existing boiler I can tell you what that means um for your boiler um since it's a little nebulous um for controls in HVAC so this is the we have the highest incentive rates that I've seen I've been in the program for seven years um so when we do we have to do a little study for controls in HBC to determine how much energy you're going to save and then then we apply um a rate to in terms of how much savings you know and and what the I think it's at this point it's $5 per therm that you save you get so much money well it's almost double this year so what I'm saying is any projects or incentives that we had for last year it's actually going to be better off this year so if you're thinking of any controls projects or HVAC Projects please reach out because now is a great time to do a study and uh earn the highest amount of incentives that I've seen um retr commissioning uh retr commissioning is always great um you could cover up to 90% of your project cost with retro commissioning um and I have seen you know typically that's if you have existing controls you're not upgrading your controls but you're having some scheduling issues um issues with your set points things aren't talking or working um we can pay for someone to come in and retr commission and fix some of those issues and I have seen these are typically pretty lowcost uh projects and I've seen them you know hit that 90% project cost Point uh lighting Brian is Morrison is is on he's going to talk about lighting more later but um suffice to say with all of the changes in legislation 2024 is going to be a great time um to do lighting really uh 2024 and 2025 um if you don't see if you have a project in mind but you don't see it on here uh please reach out if you if you do have a boiler or some other project you want to get more information on what makes it eligible um always reach out so that's the whole point you don't need to memorize any of this or any of the processes or anything like that that we're talking today as long as you're connecting with one of us we will find the answer for you go ahead Christie okay I'm gonna check real quick for questions Christina yes um there was a question um that Bruce had it was it was specific like like you said towards a um excuse me one of the um bullet points that you had if we are using an insurance claim to replace a boiler that is more efficient can we submit reimbursement for our deductible yes yeah there's no uh no requirement for you to have not be using your insurance so we we only care about the invoice and that it's installed and it meets the correct efficiency so if you want to send me that boiler spec sheet I could just confirm that it qualifies so we can go from there okay I think that was it for questions so yes there it was Brian up all right let's talk about lighting uh and the changes that are coming to your facility so there are significant changes in coming in the next couple years as a result of House Bill 2531 uh this bill was passed last year in the June of 2023 uh with the goal of reducing the environmental impact of of Mercury from florescent lamps uh it also increase Energy Efficiency uh and make led the standard for the replacement of lighting the the house bill will ban uh the the sale and distribution of these lamps um so first in uh you have screw in CFLs and bayet lamps um as of January 1 2024 this year um you can no longer purchase those in Oregon uh additionally uh next year linear fluorescence and pin-based CFLs which make up uh probably 90% of the lighting in your facility uh will be banned as of January 1st 2025 um it's really important to reiterate that this is ban on the sale and distribution of these lamps it's not for possession or for use of the um it does not mean that you need to convert all your facilities by this date um but what it does mean is you're going to see a change in the products you can buy you're going to see a change in in programs particularly Energy Trust program in this uh light will be impacted and the incentives that are available will be shifting um and and it also means that you need to have a plan um what can you convert now and take advantage of the current funding and incentives um and how will you Main maintain your fluorescent lighting after January 1st 2025 all right next slide please there go okay so you're as probably asking yourself right now we have thousands of fixtures how am I going to get them all upgraded uh is there additional funding for conversions uh how can I maximize funding and resources to complete more upgrades uh and I want to thank you for those questions it's a great question so let me let me give you my uh recommendations are that you start evaluating your facilities now uh how many fluorescent fixtures do you have in your facilities um which buildings have the most lamp and ballast failures uh which buildings are the least efficient right do you have incandescent do you have T12 and other lighting that uh is a significant energy hog in your spaces and you should Target um for upgrade as soon as possible um the other consideration I think that's really important is to um consider whether you have remodels planned in the next two to maybe five years um because what what's important here is if you go in and you install a bunch of lamps today you're going to erode uh the savings for that project uh which means that when you apply for for incentives and things like that you'll receive um less money at that time so this is one of those scenarios where uh you may want to look and create a plan about how you're going to maintain your fixtures uh in these spaces in the meantime so once you do complete that upgrade uh you can maximize the funding for your project next of course you have to prioritize those you know we covered a lot of that is you know least efficient",

        "text": " like this um Beth asked given the billions of federal dollars that have become available to counties from the inflation reduction act for greenhouse gas reduction and climate adaptation is the board developing a climate action plan that will capture some of these funds for the benefit of Washington County if so can you give some details if not yet I urge you to do so and it looks like commissioner Willie would like to address that question well that's not exactly true I I actually had a different uh point that I wanted to make so I'm going to hit the pause button on that I apologize that's okay that's why your hand up so I jump to a conclusion there no I'm sorry but go ahead who would like to like let me jump in first of all on this um the reason why I raised my hand is I think um a couple of slides back the most important slide and information there was the fact that we have projected uh from the general fund significantly exceed our Revenue projected Revenue income and that's not because we have been spending more money than we have it's because a number of factors come into play there that are beyond our control and one of the things is our Revenue source is limited to property taxes primarily and property taxes as we all know are limited to a three percent increase every year and certainly our uh inflation increases as we've all experienced every time we go to the grocery store and everywhere else has been significantly above that three percent level so I think it's very that we note that we are trying to balance a budget with limited resources and unlimited expenditures from the standpoint of what how inflation impacts our budget so that's a great uh slide Greg there I I appreciate that that's been very revealing and I just wanted to point that out ER Willie and and coming up we will have another graphic that shows the the imbalance that I believe uh County Administrator Angie is going to show the the constraints that we do have on on property taxes sure Harrington did you want to address the climate change thank you yes and I would like to further expand on something that was presented as well so first on climate change thank you very much for your question and the input on that uh your Board of Commissioners continues to work with our staff on proposals for how we might address the challenges of climate change I know we have a work session coming up in the May time frame excuse me uh to further discuss options with our staff so you as part of our openness and transparency you have access to our meeting packets right on the Washington County website through our portal and uh so stay tuned to those future work session packets you can watch the meeting on Zoom you can read the material and after the fact that you can hear our input from the videos that are available all through our County website which is washingtoncountyor.gov uh and so know that we will be taking your input and comment both through the the next steps on our proposed budget getting to adoption but also with regard to the topic uh beyond that but then uh I wanted to uh also touch on a part of your question with regard to the American Rescue plan act dollars the commission has been having conversations about how we take stock of how we've been using those dollars to date and how to take make use of the second uh have or the second tranche as the treasury U.S treasury refers to them and we'll be discussing those in future meetings as well and you can find further or more recent information uh even just this year that we've talked about by doing a search on our meeting portal for um so that's uh how I wanted to contribute to addressing that question but if I also could uh uh help expand a little bit on the information presented uh thank you Greg for what you have shared and part of what you touched on was are different functional areas and the the funding uh that we receive for that are property taxes and levies are that flexible funding through our general fund but as you talked about uh revenue from other resources such as grants from the state and federal government those often come with uh special purposes or restricted uses what we refer to as special fund so as Mr Munn's slide talked about only 25 percent of our budget is available with flexibility without special terms and many of those dollars go towards funding that county-wide service for elections General government and Public Safety the other 75 percent those are special purpose special fund dollars that can only be used for specific purpose and we don't have much control over that certainly we apply for grant funding whether it's for special public safety programs or Court programs or Transportation programs but we have to make sure it's used just for that so that's one reason why we spend the majority of our time talking about how we use the general fund dollars to provide a vast array of services for you thank you I hope that was helpful thank you chair uh Brenda what other questions do we have um I have one more from Bob asking specifically what areas were the 31 million in I think Bob is referring to slide 24 um with the cuts from last year I can take that if you could uh if you could go back to that slide that reference point there so you may not be able to see this but let me highlight a couple of these items that were made to make the bed the budget balance in fy23 so one of those and it's actually highlighted there in the bullet is was a 3.7 million dollar in uh positions that vacant positions that were frozen and that was one of them and I highlight that because we we actually developed a monitoring tool to to make sure that we were keeping track with that 3.7 million and staff across all the staff that are involved in the general fund across the county have um we've held those frozen and then some to actually uh we're ahead of that 3.7 million dollar Target we also included uh a uh set us we we um we did not make a normal transfer to help fund our I.T technology infrastructure or our facilities group so we did some one-time adjustments uh for that so those are just a couple of items that we've we made adjustments for I hope that answered your question so I'd like to um uh also share in answering that question hello Bob it's good to see you again and thank you for paying attention continue to pay attention to the work of the county as Mr Munn uh said you can find the details on page 15 of the current adopted budget document available on the website we did not cut any positions we uh paused uh new hiring so filling those vacant positions we also paused making Investments certain discretionary Investments such as you could see the first one listed under expenditure reductions we did not make our annual four million dollar allocation to ourselves to our one of our own funds the housing production opportunity fund we just excited that was discretionary so in order for Ms Andy she gave us a balanced budget which used these Solutions and we chose to continue with those recommendations in adopting our budget so we took pauses on certain Investments where we could and insert new hirings so she delivered a proposed a balanced proposed budget and we adopted a final balanced budget and now we're trying to uh learn from that and figure out how we make longer term Sustainable Solutions rather than just those one-year Solutions thanks for your question and thank you chair Harrington uh I I know there are a few more questions waiting but I think we will continue on with the next section and we will answer all your questions before we adjourn this evening so uh Mr Munn could you go ahead and touch on the challenges that you've been alluding to in the general as certainly go ahead and go to the next so uh probably one of the questions that most of you have is you know how do we get here what's caused this imbalance in the general fund and generally and I have a Graphic here that'll show this here in a minute but our expenditures have been outgrowing our Revenue and but why what's a little bit deeper into that we have a 7.7 percent growth over the last five years in expenditures versus uh just under six percent growth on our Revenue well part of that is we've had an over Reliance on one-time funds and what I mean by that is we're using our sip Revenue our strategic Strategic investment program Revenue to which is limited in term it's not ongoing it's limited in term to basically fund ongoing expenses so that's one that's one real reason there that we're talking about as we look through the budget process our health insurance costs I think most of you know or have at least heard and experienced it over the last 15 or 20 years is growing significantly faster than it used to our state retirement system costs are growing um at a much higher rate than inflation or have been in the last probably 12 to 15 years we also have unfunded State mandated programs that was mentioned earlier so there are uh laws that are passed and new programs that are required one of those for example which is a great program is our Oregon paid leave program that alone to administer it it will cost the county about 450 000 a year and that did not come with Revenue that's just a new expense that the county has to absorb to manage that that great program um we also have some of our our key facilities we we've done an assessment over the last six months and identified about 48 million dollars in some of our critical facilities work that needs to be done these critical facilities we're talking about the jail congregate housing some of our other uh our facilities that are having failing roofs we have HVAC problems our our water systems need attention and those are those are items that we have we have not planned for in the past that we need to address now are uh commissioner chair Harrington mentioned our our Financial backbone system our general ledger system which is called an Erp it is over 20 years old and needs to be replaced you know those are the things that allow us to be more efficient in our work and replace uh or to be able to use technology in a place of Labor as we move forward do our work better so the bottom line is our initial estimate is that our general fund is 7.1 percent or about 25 million dollars out of balance as we move into the FY 24 Budget Building process next slide so this graphic really tells the story this is a five-year look back from FY",

then taking a break okay uh so the next item is agenda thank you Christopher uh as an agenda item to see the public comment period this is an information item this time is reserved for the public to

ahead I saw Mike McArthur executive director of the community energy Association is my audio all right I'm hearing some yeah oh we can hear you fine go ahead um Community renewable energy Association is an intergovernmental Association whose regular membership consists of units of local governments such as cities counties Sports and irrigation districts Korea also has ex-officio members who are non-governmental organizations private businesses who are developers of renewable energy um thank you for uh including local government we have not been participating directly in this process um even though we represent most of the counties where this development is happening uh in eastern Oregon um we have we all share memberships with renewable Northwest Oregon solar and storage Association and new sun is also a member of Korea but in this case I believe that actual local government needs to be represented in the phys in the fiscal impact advisory committee directly I've contacted the association of Oregon counties of whom we're an associate and so I would encourage the committee to include either Korea or the association of counties on this advisory committee because we definitely believe that there are fiscal impacts to local governments thank you thank you for your comments oh let me also add that I we support new sentence letter that you received last okay thank you are there any other comments commenters that this time there are many thank you gotta take a final call if anyone would like to comment during this public comment period we are closing the final comment

I have a motion. Do I have a second? I'll second that. Danny Guy Quad. I have a question. Yes, sir. Why we pulled out this from consent agent and who was that? Because of that letter that. Yep. Yes. He requested to make sure that we pulled it from consent and discussed it. I have a motion. He's watching. I have a motion. And I have a second. All in favor? Anyone opposed? You? Okay. Motion carries. Yes. 2.2. Kenway for girl services. This is case number 20 3110. Seven Su. The applicant is Donna Kelly, and the agent is Tillman in associates engineering. This is a special use permit request to modify conditions of a previously approved special use permit for a private baseball facility in a one. The property is on highway 326 and it is 15.46 acres. The zoning is a one and the future land use is low residential. And here you can see the back up a second. It's a better picture. You can see you did on May 16, and it can come back within a year. They're asking to modify conditions of an approved special use permit. So. Yes, because you actually heard it April of this year, May 16. It was approved so on May 16. So we can just jump right into it if you'd like, because they're asking to amend four conditions. And if you saw the report basically just went straight into those four conditions and that was it. But as the timeline, just to remind you, there was several code cases dating back to March of 2022. On May 16 of 2023, special use permit was approved with conditions. Part of those conditions were activities were not supposed to start until a site plan was approved and the permits were all approved and activities actually continued. That night, the staff notified the applicant's agent that no more activities were allowed on the site until the site plan and the permits were approved. And then August 31, we received this application to modify several of the conditions. And on September 13, for a building code issue. Now, for having buildings without permits on the site, the applicant went to the code enforcement board and stated that the special use permit had been changed without a public hearing and that they had been continuing to use the site even though the special use permit conditions are active. And one note is that the structure with the batting cages and the restrooms, it's all in one building, currently does not meet the setbacks, and it does not qualify for a variance because there's no hardship on the property. Other conditions that were approved that they would like to amend was condition number one. I think it was one, four, five and nine. So condition one was the condition that said that they needed a site plan to be approved before any activities could be conducted on site. The applicant has proposed that they use porta potties or temporary bathrooms. The staff's analysis of this is that the commercial use of the site is for practice, so there's no temporary practice on the site because that's what the site is for. It's for practice. So that makes it a permanent commercial use, and permanent commercial uses require permanent restroom facilities. So staff does. Staff recommends that we don't change that condition because that at the previous special use permit, this board had recommended to allow them to use Port au potties for up to nine months. At the BCC hearing that was determined that was not going to be allowed, and the board approved no porta potties. So we approved that, or the board of county commissions approved it with the conditions that they're trying to change now. And they became in violation of the special use permit and a code enforcement case was open. And that's why we're here, because they are trying to get rid of these conditions now. Well, to correct that, a code case was not opened up for that violation of those conditions, but they weren't complying with those conditions. No code case related to those conditions was open, but there was previous code cases open, and those are being handled, and most of those are through the building safety department. But the board did approve the special use permit May 16 with the conditions that were. That are in the report. And the applicant is now asking to change four of those conditions, they relate to two different topics. One is the site plan and permits being approved before any activities can take place on site. Well, two activities. Two of the conditions relate to that issue, and then the other two conditions relate to the approved buffering plan or the approved buffers from the special use permit. And the applicant did propose new buffer. Miss. Sorry, we're having technical difficulties. I apologize. Okay. Tvs are tired. The applicant has buffers that they were required to provide, install and maintain per the special use permit. And they had proposed different buffers on and that would be condition number four and five. So condition four said that the modified c type buffer shall be installed along the southern and western boundaries and the buffer shall contain at least two shade trees and three accent ornamental trees for every 100 linear feet or fraction thereof. Shrubs, ground cover, excluding turf grass shall comprise of at least 50% of the required buffer, which is a standard c type buffer. Buffers along the northern boundary. The applicant will work with parks and recreation or parks for a performance based buffer and a combination of clumping variety of bamboo number with four inch Florida number one shade trees to create a buffer that is 20 foot tall within two years. And the buffer is required to work in tandem with the photometric plan. So they submitted a new buffer plan. We sent it over to parks for their comments as well and basically summarize what they said. The northern buffer, the eastern buffer, the southern and the western buffer don't meet the intention of the special use permit and they did not support the changes, which is it would send a report and staff does not support the proposed changes to any of the four proposed changes or any of the four conditions proposed to be changed. The applicant is here and we'll be glad to answer any questions. Is it unusual to come back after special. Is it unusual to come back after a special use permit asking to change the special use permit? Because I don't remember one since I'm on the board. Every now and then it happens. It is allowed. They can request to modify. Okay. But usually when you tell it, they asked if they can change conditions and you explain the process if they want. Most applicants decide not to do that. And I believe this is David Tillman again from Tillman associates. And you guys are recommending denial? Yes. Okay. Denial for all the new condition or denial for the. Well, we can't deny the original special use permit where we're recommending denial of the change conditions so that the conditions that were approved with the original special use permit, those are the conditions that should be followed that's what I like to do. Thank you. Yep. David. Okay, thank you. Good afternoon. David Tillman, Tillman associates engineering. 1720 Southeast 16th Avenue, building 100, Ocala, Florida. So there was. I went and spoke to one of the neighbors immediately after the hearing last time, and it was approved with the bamboo as part of the buffer. And one of the things they asked for was they said, please get rid of the bamboo. We don't want the bamboo. No bamboo. So that's one of the reasons for the changing of some of the material that was requested in that also, if you look at the buffer plan versus what is being proposed in the conditions for the buffer, there's a lot of redundancy. So we're looking at having to plant in areas where there's already vegetation in the area. So we're asking to provide a different plan that we feel like provides a buffer adjacent to anywhere that's needed. We've also talked with the majority of the neighbors. Not all the neighbors, but there's one neighbor that we haven't spoken to, but he's the one that said",

36 others or what what's the to I I don't know how other states um manage the security instrument and if they require it um and what the revolving line of credit can be used for which I presume is development um but do we know what the what the existing security um requirements are with respect to that letter of credit the revolving line letter of credit or line of credit the the I think my to the best of my ability to respond to your question we don't have that information as to like where in the list and how much money in uh I'm just trying to look in the DPO to get the actual number uh that's that wasn't like where we were in the list wasn't um isn't provided I guess and um thank you for that and I I guess and I I will have some further comments under organizational expertise in the inquiry and Analysis we do but you know I would hope that would be a question we would ask with respect to the security um the explanation of security offered um with this and in the future so in Wells Fargo we did receive in um exhibit M that we received uh a bank letter from Wells Fargo bank which indicated and this is what you're talking about it indicated that next era energy Capital Holdings Inc which is ultimately the company um up up the rungs holds um or has an existing revolving credit and letter of credit in an aggregate amount of 4 b256 million and so like as I am understanding your question like how much of that four billion is occupied and is there enough to satisfy the 30 million estimate were recommending that is that well obviously the three billion would be enough but if we're in line with others um what's potentially the call for for um for that that obligation you know sometimes we can get um blinded by the zeros I guess billions of dollars is a lot of money in their in their in their organizational expertise material they represent they that they have 175 energy facilities in 36 States and so what is what is all that total that's yes that is my what do those um projects facilities require um insecurity against that line of credit and the line of credit is is it I would presume it's uh usable for development projects that for a variety of things and you know pretty soon the billions are used up and so I'm just curious uh the analysis done as opposed to well three billion is a lot more than you know X Millions yeah and so we're good so just we don't have to belabor it but um that certainly is a question of mine I mean ultimately as a preon recommended as a preconstruction condition we before they could do anything we would require them to ride us with a bonder or letter of credit so I mean they can't build it if there isn't any money to to uh cover their costs than they can't right build it so I I understand that yeah okay um but that that doesn't speak to the call against that what what is being secured so again I don't want to belabor it but um it's an underlying question of mine thank you um thank you with that I will unless there's any um comments questions on any of these standards I'll move on into the rest of seeing nobody that I can see I'll move on uh so this slide is on the organizational expertise of the uh of the applicant the applicant again is Wagon Trail energy LLC and this is a Project Specific LLC that is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of next era energy Resources LLC the applicant relies on the expertise of its parent company NeXT era um next era has 175 energy facilities in 36 States and four Canadian provinces as of year end 2019 um in Oregon as FC approved facilities uh next AAS subsidiaries operate the wheat rdge renewable energy facility two Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three wheat rdge renewable energy East and the state lined wind project which um includes state line one and two as well as Van Sickle two Wind Facility like a conglomerate State Line win project but um two different um on the record of the DPO multiple commenters expressed their support for next era as a company um and for the wagon tra solar project itself with that the department doesn't recommend any changes be made to uh the proposed order as a result of these comments and that's all I am presenting for organizational expertise and it looks like uh Vice chair Condon has her hand up yes thank you Chase um and this is a general um comment not necessarily um related directly to Wagon Trail I appreciate um the comments from the people who um gave comment at the previous uh hearing and their compliments to next era for how they were dealt with but um as I review the organizational expertise and I know many of you have heard me talk about this before um I our analysis of expertise from a financial perspective uh together with the representations from uh this applicant as well as other applicants that they are able to do able and willing to do the projects as they are presented in the time frames for the start of construction and I do understand that things can change it takes longer to get power purchase agreements and agreements with uh land owners but but um I believe our analysis for organizational expertise needs to be much more robust much as we rely on other agencies to do an analysis for fish and wildlife historical and cultural um those are I don't know very much about those things I'm learning along the way but there they appear to be fairly robust and our analysis for organizational expertise relies mainly on representations from the applicant and um I I do believe we need to do a a deeper dive um uh we have letters from organizations saying I'm sure they will be able to get uh security um the Articles of Incorporation tell me a very different story and um that's a general comment and I know we we do have a plan for perhaps looking at this further but I want to make a comment with respect to this application and I um I think our analysis is is somewhat lacking so and I understand it's consistent with um the basic analysis we've done um in the past but I would like to see a stronger um of specifically financial information and their ability to start the project when they're telling us they're starting it um construction so thank you Mr chair if I might yes secretary cornette thank you for the record Todd cornette um so yeah just in response to Vice chair condon's comments",

        "text": " for reap which is the rural energy for America program electric cooperatives are eligible for for that funding as rural small businesses and that can fund up to a 50 of a community solar project um capped out at a million dollars and um certainly reach out to us or the USDA State office to explore those there are also loan guarantees and other um types of financing that USDA provides to co-ops that they're a great resource Odo obviously has had its uh c-rep Community renewable energy uh Project funding opportunity for a number of years maybe subject to further Appropriations but targeted for public agencies so our public utility districts and Municipal Utilities would be eligible applicants um if if there's funding in that program traditionally it's been very challenging for our consumer and utilities to leverage federal tax credits especially um for very small projects or or even medium-sized projects it's just very expensive to structure tax Equity Partnerships well the game has been changed now and we have direct payment options we have transferable tax credits so now that investment tax credit should be available to most Community solar projects that are Advanced and there's a number of adders applicable as well if you're using domestic content there is a low income Adder that is a competitive application that can apply um so some tribal projects can receive I think up to 70 percent uh in terms of a federal tax credit which you know is a world of difference from the the challenges that we've seen even just a couple years ago and then lastly we do have this Oregon climate Protection Program um that could be realizing significant dollars for for this purpose the the pro the program was uh executive order and is under legal challenge so it may be a question mark If it materializes but um if it does it could mean a significant uh dollars for both uh economic and environmental outcomes that have an equity focus and so that that is really what we're talking about here with solar for all um and then lastly here I list technical assistance as a big opportunity where you know a meaningful part of this hundred million dollar solar for all budget in Oregon can go to technical assistance and so um you know with the barriers I've shared and I'm sure there is more when we talk about Workforce and Community engagement and and realizing these meaningful benefits um really hearing from the community and from stakeholders on this call of what type of assistance is needed um will help the team hear better craft that for for better outcomes next slide so um just touching here on some of our lessons learned and takeaways over the years around kind of the the important um factors in how Community solar can be successful and um you know what are kind of the the critical elements that that we've seen to uh enable projects um and you know really the the first one is enabling that virtual bill crediting um you know there are challenges with with renters and their land uh Lords and whether you can do rooftop solar everywhere and to really Reach the the lowest income brackets um having that kind of virtual asset in terms of the bill credit is really just the the most direct way to realize those um those outcomes when we're talking about Equitable access to solar and meaningful benefits and Bill savings um that virtual bill crediting is is something that um that is a big tool um and also securing Grant funds will maximize just the the long-term value to any subscriber whether it's low income or otherwise and so that list of funding opportunities is really important to keep in mind is you know the more we can fully fund these projects the more benefits will accrue to to low-income um because you're not having to pay for pay a loan off or pay debt service or pay out of pocket um we're going to try to cover as much of that up front as possible at least that's been bef's approach over the um you know another approach that we have taken is um uh directing corporate donations into um we have a relatively modest tribal renewable energy fund where um if corporations are participating in our other programs or buying some of our environmental products we we give them the option to donate additional money to facilitate tribal energy projects and then um some of the other partners here Ryan Rob and others talked about Community engagement and and how community-based organizations are really important in kind of pairing projects and the benefits they bring with community members and you know for us what that means is uh capacitating Partners you know how do we provide long-term certainty that our community-based organizations are at the table committed bring the right motivations and expertise and can do that over a multi-year period is is a big part of having a strong partnership and having those Partners help achieve some of the goals that we're striving for so that's part of it is making sure the partners are appropriately resourced and have the capacity to engage and then also co-creating projects with those Partners so you know whether it's a consumer on utility and you know a cap agency in that Community you know making sure that um both sides of that partnership are adequately resourced and collaborating for Mutual benefit the other thing here is is patience consistency and Longevity um you know especially dealing with community-based organizations um you know uh that longevity is very important to know that these Partners will be at the table over a multi-year period and you're working in the same direction towards the same goals and um you know that's that's a big part of uh success for for these projects um and and lastly there are meaningful benefits and wealth building that's that's been a priority for us you know EPA wants to see a minimum of 20 savings on average to a household and that that means they're essentially you know their annual electricity bills they want to see it reduced by at least 20 percent um you know some folks might argue that that is not meaningful enough and even in our investor owned utility territory um they now require low-income subscriptions to save 40 on on their subscription so if we can go above and beyond 20 um I think that would be much more um next slide a few resources for folks to look at um you know for Municipal Utilities for um some financing opportunities and you know there's there's many more we could um I think EPA even has a long spreadsheet list of resources that folks can peruse um but I will just leave with with one last thought that that Rob alluded to so bef is is here and committed to the consumer owned utility uh Community solar program in Oregon um you know we we feel like we can fill a good role here within the state and have Odo in the lead um we did a bit of Outreach in other Northwest states and um you know Odo is is pretty well resourced and staffed but in the states of Idaho Montana and Wyoming that is not the case so currently bef is pursuing applications in in those three states to be the prime applicant and fill this role that that Odo is so um you know hopefully there will be some synergies across these programs and and we can share Lessons Learned and um you know share program design elements but um we're going to have our work cut out for us over the next uh six to eight weeks in in getting some strong applications in so any suggestions and support from stakeholders here and and communities um is is definitely appreciated as we uh work towards achieving these meaningful I think that's it for me Rob uh contact info there alrighty thank you Evan a lot of great information there and now we will move over into our Workforce discussion and I'd like to pass it off to Wendy Simon's great thanks Rob can can you hear me just quick sound check yes great well good afternoon everyone as Rob said my name is Wendy Simons I work as an energy policy Analyst at Odo and I'm supporting this Oregon solar for all application on Workforce and contractor development issues so just a quick overview of my presentation I'll begin with a summary of the meaningful benefits relating to Workforce Development and quality jobs that are in the application evaluation criteria for the solar for all I'll then discuss some of our initial thoughts on work Workforce and contractor development after our initial round of conversations with several the opportunity announcement includes evaluation criteria around job quality which I will summarize and then finally I'll wrap up with some of our questions to stakeholders who are participating today and those questions will also be concluded included in the comment portal if you prefer to provide written feedback or if you'd like to forward the comment portal link to some of your so uh starting off uh you may recall that my colleague Jen Center spoke in her introduction about the meaningful benefits that are expected outcomes for solar for all and also just to mention as a tie-in to Evan's presentation he mentioned technical assistance and this whole area of contractor and Workforce Development is part of the technical assistance kind of falls under that umbrella for the solar for all program so the meaningful benefits under solar for all includes several things as people have mentioned uh savings on energy bills and greenhouse gas and other environmental benefits but it also um a quote investing in high quality jobs and businesses in low-income and disadvantaged communities by supporting prevailing wages investing in effective Workforce training programs for underserved populations for example pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs and prioritizing Equitable economic opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses and throughout the application that there are a few other mentions of possible uses of the funds it's not restricted I think there there are several possibilities that could support a job development training and contractor development that can serve the goals of the solar for all so examples of programs that could include and this again this is not exclusive it could include Workforce training programs that enable underserved communities to participate in the energy transition and the opportunities in the marketplace um wrap around Supportive Services case management on-the-job support and mentorship for uh workers or potential workers in the industry um the opportunity announcement also mentions project labor and or Community benefits agreements as a tie-in to the workforce and contractor Development Area next slide please so starting off with the Workforce Development just a few of our overarching thoughts we're planning one Workforce track uh serving all four of the solar kind of programmatic tracks so there would not um we wouldn't be separating things out specifically for Community solar or single family or multi-family we're we're trying to help support the development of Workforce and contractor base for solar Statewide for uh all four of those tracks we have been told and I've heard from more than one person and more than one organization that this is a fairly crowded space",

        "text": " any sort of new uh new ignition source that's introduced is is at least addressed and uh and mitigated to some extent so so that that is the you know significant increase or no significant increase in risk to standard um and then the third alternative uh that we looked at was really that the council could just say we need you to characterize the risk of the site uh in an appropriate way and if you find there is a high risk area or a high consequence area at that site you cannot build your your facility there and that is a standard that um i think is you know fairly reasonable but we think that with does not allow for mitigation so we um have like looked at this other option in the combination with the mitigation plan if there is significant risk at the site um even if that risk is not increased by the proposed facility um i will just point out uh since councilwoman jenkins kind of brought it up earlier a fourth alternative would be to have no specific decision criteria here and just require the wildfire risk mitigation plan um and you would just need to make sure it satisfied uh the criteria required for that plan go ahead hanley yeah marcy ms hanley christopher i'm a little concerned about using significant increase again you know we use we use that word pretty any development is going to increase risk i would think really what it boils down to is how are we going to measure significant a significant increase and that's what i like about the wildfire protection plan is it identifies what might be the significant risk and what the mitigation opportunities might be associated with we have you have mitigation here in this alternative um i don't know how you get there without wildfire protection plan can could you um one encounter just basically i identify the risks and then and the mitigations and demonstrate that it's not significant is that what you're after uh councilmember jenkins yeah my my how i imagined this was that if they were in a low fire risk area you know they would say well yes like we are introducing some risk uh but you know we'll use park arresters we'll use basic safety protocols and uh you know apply the commonly accepted vegetation protocols uh that are required by the nesc and like based on just those kind of like basic minimum requirements uh any risk that we're introducing is sufficiently mitigated so there's no significant increase without preparing the detailed wildfire mitigation plan honestly i don't know if there's huge difference between that and saying well you have to have your wildfire mitigation plan and if it's low risk then you don't have to include as much detail in that wildfire mitigation plan because there's less risk to mitigate um i will say another weakness with our recommendation is that it kind of does set it up as a one-time decision uh so the council makes its evaluation of risk at the site at the time that the application is submitted uh but as we know wildfire risk does change over time uh and so revisiting this decision uh is uh not necessarily built into the process that we've described in the draft proposed rules but if you were to just require a wildfire mitigation plan and you would require that plan to be updated um you could get up-to-date information about the risk at the site on on whatever uh period you thought was appropriate and we've included a language now that says if you have to have a wildfire mitigation plan then you have to update it on a schedule that you that the applicant has proposed the puc just requires annual updates of all their plans the council could do something similar if you want and i think that would be this is handling i'd support that i i just don't know how you get there if you you know we at the local level um we make decisions for wildfire protection require that there be water sources and and um and then we don't follow up with inspections or maintenance or any of that stuff and that's really a drawback in those decisions and i think we should not try and end up in the same pitfall here this is kent is this working yeah and on that note i alternative one is looking at minimizing the risk of an energy facility caused wildfire and i think alternative three is the opposite of that kind of the vulnerability of an energy facility at a certain site that's a high risk fire if i'm reading that right and i i'm hoping but alternative to is kind of a blend of the two where it's looking at the vulnerability of the facility at a certain site as well as that the energy facility itself won't cause a wildfire and so am i understanding that correctly is that what the intent is of alternative to uh yes it is uh it is intended to look at both the um the the wildfire hazard and the probability of ignition and then the consequences and anything to a certain extent i will just say that alternative three also was was intended to be uh say if you like look at the probability and the risk all right and the the exposure or that would be in your assessment of whether or not it's a high fire risk zone but yeah but i think your characterization of alternatives too is is spot-on comes from overhead chris this is marcy i think for me part of it is just that we are being clear that we're taking this issue seriously and i don't i don't expect to have all the dots connected i guess because it's going to continue evolving um something as simple as when a developer doesn't start and it gets kicked down they can but i just for me it's just important that they know that while you may not fall under the regulatory commission that we still have this expectation um again looking at the communities and it gives the community folks something to inquire about when these things are being developed as well thank you chair crow um do want to circle back to council members jenkins proposal i can pull up the draft language here and uh kind of show you how it would look to just um perhaps uh require um i here let me i won't make you scroll chris can i ask you to hold on for one second because i have another question i have a question what about dwayne how does he feel about this whole thing as the compliance officer did he have any weigh-in because i feel like we're getting ready to ask him to do something and remember girl i have had like brief conversations about this with swain but i don't think i can speak for for uh any specific feedback i've received from him no worries i'm sure i can uh so for the record talk i can respond to that to some degree i i think you know some staff have have raised this as you know how do we implement this you know this is not our area of expertise you know we can certainly like anything else come up to um but i think we're going to have to figure out you know whatever it is that council decides to do with this if you decide to move forward and you adopt rules you know we will implement them to our best of our ability that may be that based on the way the rules are written we can handle it we can review that and whether that's dwayne or dwayne and a combination of others could be that we need to rely on consultants to help us or it could be we rely on consult consultants to help us bridge that gap to gain that knowledge and expertise but it's a good question i appreciate the i don't have a great answer for you right now because we don't know what the rules essentially are that's going to be for council to decide um but yes it's going to add some more complexity and some different area for us to become knowledgeable of in order to implement them and we recognize that you know that that's going to fall to us and i thank you todd um mrs marcy i just i don't um mean to imply that it would all land on him but i think it's important that as a department as a staff that it's going to be something different and and that you should get the resources that you need to to do this again it's it's something that affects the entire state and um we should be mindful i hate to beat the proverbial dead horse but we heard a lot about it on our road show and um i don't think anyone would block it giving the resources necessary sorry about that chris i'm done yeah marcy this is hanley that's probably one of the reasons i like the wildflower mitigation plan approach because it's clear what your targets are it provides more clarity for the public it provides more clarity for the development of of the project and then for the long-term maintenance and evaluation by the department so while it's difficult to require another plan of these developers i think this approach would provide a lot more clarity for everyone involved cindy joe um cindy condon i this may be way off the mark but i am curious taught or chris if you know anything about our site certificate holders um should the mitigation plan everything and there's a wildfire caused by a facility is there insurance is insurance available to have to carry insurance i don't even know if our certificate holders have to carry insurance today and that to me is a financial risk certainly not only to the site certified older but to us the state and i'm just curious how insurance might fit into wildfire mitigation planning they may not get be able to get all councilmember condon if a certificate holder is a regulated public utility i think there are some insurance requirements and binding requirements and i know there's some specific statutory language uh that nuclear power plants and other nuclear installations have insurance but i'm actually not sure if there's any other insurance requirements imposed by the citing process you know that could be something that was looked at in in the organizational expertise or uh financial insurance standards but um i don't believe it is now um although i would assume that there's at least some coverage from some of these for for these facilities and i don't know i'll defer to secretary cornette or others if if there's anything i'm missing for the record todd cornett um we do not have any requirements for you know posting insurance you know other than that sort of bond requirement which is sort of a different concept um whether or not independent power producers have to maintain um insurance i don't know we can certainly look into that um but i i would not want to answer that question because i do not know so i because i'm kind of that at that address your question i know it didn't mean sorry i got i got some information so that's good thank you excellent thank you uh so",

conversations and we're moving toward a letter of uh uh with the port of Portland so yes is is the answer and and the conversation side is owned by the port uh most of that part of Hayden Island which you probably know is behind a fence uh is uh controlled by the port of Portland and much of the Rivergate Industrial Area through which the AC cables will pass uh some of it is owned by the ports of them is owned by the the uh uh interests that have bought land but most of that is leased so yeah we absolutely need the cooperation of the port of Portland and at this point they've been very uh uh I don't want to mischaracterize it they've been highly Cooperative because they see this as an opportunity not just uh you know for their business interests but also the whole clean energy aspect of it and the community benefits aspect of it is important to the board as well okay thank you Ariana's been patiently waiting online so I want to give her the chance to comment and then we'll we'll take take yours if that's okay one other question you Richard Kim you indicate on your brochure that there's um between three to four hundred uh union job how does that fit into this project when I don't a barge isn't going to take that much so where does that all fit in that's almost all of that is involved in the uh construction of the converter stations so uh and remember there will be two converter stations constructed uh over at two three year period so so the the jobs we're referring to are construction jobs during that construction period so how long of a period would that be in terms of the construction jobs what do you that month because they'd be involved in yes we're expecting and and you know what on a project like this that it Peaks yeah of course okay so um uh but yeah the the construction period is envisioned as a three-year period three years yeah thank you I want to make one comment uh in response to that as well because there are some comments that were made last night in the Dows related to kind of Labor and Union was present there and they're present here and we appreciate their presence um but we have within our process any jurisdiction or any authority over unions or labor or requirements so while we certainly encourage the applicant to you know Avail themselves of of union labor that's not anything that we can make a requirement or condition of approval it it is strictly outside of our jurisdiction um based on statutory Provisions so I just want to make sure that's clear when everybody is I went back early in the process talked about our standards and that we are limited to our standards and that labor and Union requirements are not related to our standards all right Ariana you should be unmuted now thank you for your patience no worries thanks my name is Ariana shippioni and I'm the regional habitat biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and I had a couple of do you know what the wattage of the Neptune and the other New York project um what what are the individual wattages of those two projects and also do you know the wattage of the San Francisco project okay our Neptune Project is 660 our Hudson Project follows the same uh technical regimen if you will it's also 660 megawatts the transbait cable is 400 megawatts okay were there any endangered cell monitor present in the Neptune Project I'm sorry I didn't understand that were there any endangered salmonets present in the river system for the Neptune or New York project they weren't they weren't a significant uh aspect of the uh the the endangered species uh for The Hudson Project that was of most concern was sturgeon Atlantic sturgeon and for the Neptune Project a significant concern but this was a commercial concern as well as environmental was uh shellfish shellfish beds in the Raritan Bay uh so and and there were other considerations but uh from memory that those those were the uh species of of greatest concern for one reason or another okay I I should mention though that um uh salmonids in the San Francisco Bay this was not our project but the one I referred to earlier uh is uh was a species of concern uh in the San Francisco Bay and uh the impact on that I believe was uh you know reviewed very significantly on that project I I can't speak from first-hand experience on that one though and then you mentioned that the lifespan of the cable was around 40 years is that correct and then what would be done at the end of the cable life to to the first point the 40-year lifespan is is likely to be less than what it will really be because the cable itself once it's installed uh stays in one place uh but let's say it's 40 years so the question is what do you do with that uh the answer varies uh because one option would be to Simply take the the cable out uh from under the sediment pull it up uh we know that that could be done but it can also uh be determined by the agencies that the most uh environmentally benign solution is to leave it in place so there's there's not a uh there's not a cut and dried answer to that it depends on the conditions okay there wouldn't be a the possibility of another cable being installed in its well I suppose it's a theoretically a theoretical possibility uh you mean at the at the end of the of its current life cycle I I would expect but that would be I think someone else's decision in 40 the conditions of the electric systems at that time would weigh heavily into all of the options that would be as a cable is is approaching its uh end of life so to speak there are cables out there that have been in service for 60 years and that's been documented the systems that are looked at in the 20 to 40 year time frame are typically the electronic control systems we all know about electronic obsolescence and how that plays into our world for a whole lot of things we do the same thing is true with with converter stations and the control systems that that play a part in in managing the transfer the cables themselves I don't want to say they're benign but they're they're fairly passive devices they once they go in they're in service for a good long so I'm gonna respond as well I'm gonna go back to our standards I had the list of Standards on the slide one of the standards I mean I didn't talk about any of the standards really in detail but one of the standards of the council is uh Financial assurance and decommissioning um and so with every single project that we have um we evaluate and as part of the applicant's responsibility is is to submit to us what the entire cost of removing the facility and returning the location to a useful non-hazardous uh situation so that's part of their burden they would have to submit to us whether the ultimate decision would be to leave it in place they would have to submit to us what the cost is and all of the elements of removing that cable and then prior to beginning construction we would require a bond or letter of credit to be submitted to the Oregon Department of energy which we would hold through the end of the life cycle of the facility so one of the requirements is that you know once the facility is concluded they would basically submit a decommissioning plan and they would propose whether to remove it or or to leave it in place the council would evaluate that and um it would either be removed or left in um but until that is done and until that is finalized we would hold that Bond or letter of credit uh and annually we would adjust it for inflation right now with all of our facilities we have 220 million dollars worth of bonds and letters of credit of when solar transmission other facilities so I don't know what the cost of this would be but they would be obligated to submit that and we would hold that in through the entirety of the project that way if they went away um they sort of vanished and didn't have the ability to you know remove that facility we could do it instead of them so I just want to make sure that that's an important part of our process and again I said you know we are here from the very beginning to the very end of of each project and that's a big deal for the state of Oregon and that's why that's one of our very important thanks for that clarification I just have one more question what is the EMF reading of the cables at the surface of the riverbed or at the level of the riverbed not the surface I should say and then what is the EMF reading at the surface of the water an estimate not a of course I know the rubber depth changes I can answer the first one the second one at the surface of the water it would be zero uh over ambient over ambient go ahead play with the cable these cables are shielded heavily so if you look at the the cross section of the cable you've got the center core conductor you've got the insulation around that you have the sheath and the armor which are heavily grounded at each end of the so when it when it comes out of the water it goes into a transition joint and those uh parts of the cable are grounded significantly there so the EMF that can escape the cable sort of uh speak is negligible uh do I have a good number for that no I don't uh but I can tell you from experience where we've taken measurements in other places the readings are are quite low so uh we could do some more digging on that uh Chris mentioned that there's some studies out there that help give perspective on that and I strongly recommend people taking a read on those to understand how that works but it's important to understand that our cables are heavily shielded heavily grounded EMF in and of itself does not present itself as a as a significant problem to be addressed and it's it's due to the design of the cable there were uh post installation studies done on that issue for Neptune and uh we could we can provide those I just don't know the the uh you know the the numbers off the top of my head but I do know that if as Ernie said it was negligible yeah I'd love to see those and just noting",

        "text": " the current timeline holds that that we have shown tonight or roughly two years from start of construction so some of those final procurement decisions will be made closer to to breaking ground and you know in this industry there's a lot of kind of constantly changing Dynamics when it comes to supply chain and availability of equipment uh you know Evolutions in technology Etc um so I would say you know likely over the the next year or so getting into 2025 when we're going through final design and Engineering um making the those kind of firmer construction plans and Contracting decisions is likely when we'll okay be making those um decisions and um with all of that in mind you know we we attempted to in our application preserve a little bit of flexibility um for some different Technologies right given that it's you know still a decision that um needs to be made closer to start a construction so um I don't know if David Weiss is available to jump in on that and speak a little bit more about the uh EPC management project delivery team's approach to that sure um good evening everyone meant to be there in person but uh there were some issues in Dallas Fort Worth so unfortunately I'm calling in from Nashville uh Music City but as far as the the timeline for how we make that decision there's a lot of things that go into play um we're still we're still considering both Technologies at this St at this point um we have uh batteries in our Fleet um essentially that we've been operating for a while so we're we're you know well aware of of what goes into construction uh management and operation of of both types of batteries so um like Logan says the the decision really falls on you know we want the to go with the best quality product to provide the best um reliable power when called upon from the utility so we're going to continue those coordinations with the utility and as they're a customer um that's gonna be a big part ofis okay good thank you I know just a brief follow up of what kinds of support are Bonville Power and umil Electric Co-op uh looking forward to if you incorporate batteries what kind of dynamic uh hour by hour kind of or next day or what kind of voltage support or dispatchability or what what are they looking for sure well possibly a mix of a few things that you just mentioned and I'm going to get out of out ahead of my over my skis pretty quickly uh on this subject but um in general I think you're you're touching on a important point which is that the equipment selection the technology selection the configuration of the energy storage depends a lot on the customer and who's buying the power and what what are they looking for um so you know we are pursuing interconnection and transmission agreements with ueec and BPA they will not necessarily be the customer for the project right um you know our customers do tend to be utilities or large commercial industrial power users but uh as we're still working through trying to get those contracts sorted out I think that will also inform a lot those will indicate what what's being looked for okay and then and the FC permit process does offer that Dynamic you know kind of scope versus specific I can speak to that a little bit Yeah so the applicant team like they mentioned have as for flexibility to use uh multiple different chemistries so we kind of look at the worst case scenario to determine compliance with the standards and also what the additional conditions of approval would be so for example we know no wiium ion chemistries can have a little higher fire risk just because of some thermal so so we'll look at that for determining with Wildfire they also I think typically have bigger HVAC systems so they might have a little larger noise profile so we we permit to allow them that flexibility to kind of um do something less impactful if they want to use a different chemistry or technology neutral in that way and so as as that's developed and built out will that uh be published as part of the permit the the more specific data needs and support needs of the buyers right maybe the the the final design I expect will be publicly available yeah we we will we will require a final site design um so we'll kind of need you to say how many containers and where and we'll need you to do a final noise analysis but I don't know if we'll get into the really detailed technical engineering or the technical standards because that's a little outside of what the the council looks at right but as far as the final permit will have all the different technical conditions and standards that they have to meet regardless of Technology yeah and obviously all of our you know Supply agreements our off take agreements Etc all that's pretty confidential but oh right but I would love to keep a dialogue going with you I can tell this is a a subject that you're passion about give you as much information as we're allowed to give sure good yeah thank you thank you thank you so much project right anyone else in the audience questions or general comments I like to think about it a little bit more and see if we have anybody online right uh Mark Henry and see Mark Henry if you're there please go ahead hi can you hear me yes we can hi uh thank you for for taking my questions um I'm I'm an industry person uh I've you know studied a lot of different battery chemistries um and I've looked at a lot of you know public and private companies just staying on the topic of battery storage um I guess given the fact that this is you know going to be a seven gig hour proposed project uh how you know how critical is it that the um supplier of the battery energy storage system whether it be you know the zinc hybrid or lithium ion um you know how how critical is it that they have the manufacturing capacity to be able to provide you know seven gwatt hours of of um of of batteries in the time frame that the project is going to be developed and just on the on the um on the notion that you know lithium ion does propose significant you know thermal Runway and fire risk how much of that is a uh decision factor in making a decision of which technology to select it for the project great thank you Mark um this is Logan and I'll take I guess the question in two parts first of all the um ability of the manufacturers to supply the the equipment that's needed for the facility is a a very key consideration in the uh procurement process for us and um toer point will you know uh influence which provider we go with which technology we go with based on kind of those Supply supply chain Dynamics um that exist when we get to that decision point um on the second question you know we have a number of exhibits and attachments in the application that address kind of fire risk Wildfire risk um all the preventative measures that we're going to commit to taking to to minimize and contain that risk and um ultimately you know we will not be allowed to build a facility um that does not comply with the conditions of the site certificate and and we do expect there will be conditions addressing some of those concerns as well um that's about as technical as I can get on it we'd be happy to to get your information and and maybe put you in touch with some of our folks to have a deeper discussion but um I don't know if Len if you want to add anything to that tonight uh just that the the fire plan yeah it it's called the fire management plan trying to remember all the titles of it is uh an attachment to exhibit v as invictor of the application so there's a fair amount of detail both in your construction and operation about um considerations that will need to be taken to reduce the risk of fire either moving through the facility or you know being created by facility construction or operation got it thank you so much for your response just as one one followup um in exhibit B in the uh application it shows very clearly that uh EOS Energy Enterprise is um seems to be the uh battery OEM if you guys were to go down the route of selecting the zinc hybrid technology I just want to confirm whether or not it is in fact EOS energy um as the zinc Battery Technology or are there other zinc um Technologies out there that you guys are considering uh I know that Logan had mentioned zinc air I'm not sure if that was a mistake but is is is OS energy Enterprises the uh the battery OEM and the reason why I bring that up is they're building out manufacturing capacity in their Turtle facility uh which which you know would clearly you know be uh suitable for the level of scale needed for the project so I'm just curious if there can be a comment on that yeah great question uh Mrs lanaa again and and the application the way the application is structured and exhibit B um like boy to because I thought you said v like Victor at the beginning but um exhibit B includes several examples of for example what panels you know an example of panels that might be used um and some different figures for um what the battery storage technology might look like just so that you can get an idea of how the project would look and what kinds of Technology might be used those are just examples and they're not a final technology Sol C they're just intended to provide a basis for the impact analysis that's presented in the rest of the application I don't know Chris if you want to say anything else about that um yeah no no just that yeah we will kind of again we're looking at really the the test case and so we do appreciate that you'll provided kind of specific examples particularly for measuring you know like how much panels might weigh if you pick a good example like that but um the department and the permit will not be vendor specific so we're not holding the applicant to any particular vendor as long as you're selecting a vendor that has um you know complied with the applicable underwriter laboratory standards for fire safety and things like that so um yeah we uh again you know I think what's in the application is really representative of what is kind of the worst most impact scenario I would say worst case because you know I think big facility is not necessarily the worst case but um most impactful uh configuration of the facility and it it's not meant to be binding at least that's how we view got it thank you so much for your time and luck thank you and I'll just say I I probably did misspeak when I said zinc air so apologies for that um but zinc hyrid",

        "text": " we're going to compare to number one uh plus a couple of other things at the end here and and this one is really important if the greenhouse gas emissions matter to you or the electric utility provider has a pull down list and we have all of our oregon electric utility providers listed here you should pick one uh that is going to be serving your uh because these are these are going to change and in some cases should change pretty uh pretty far um we can we can look at this one and in a minute after we start looking at the outputs uh we'll come back and change it and show you what i mean there um there's also a spot here for you to claim whether you want to account for the clean fuels program credits um you can say yes or no and uh and i'll just give another word of advice here that if you're counting on the income from those credits you will probably want to check with the the department of of environmental quality uh check with their program staff directly um the reason for this is that some fuels the you earn the credit the end user earns the credit and in other fuels it's the fuel deliverer or provider that earns the credit that tends to be more gaseous uh you know the um propane and compressed natural gas if those are delivered to you likely the credit's going to the party that's delivering that fuel um on the other hand if you're going to run electricity and you're going to meter it separately you can you could become the credit uh credit owner in that case um however if you're working with a utility and they're giving you an incentive toward that uh that charging system they might be interested in trading the dollars basically for those credits um so so that would be something you'll need to pay attention as you negotiate uh any incentives towards the charging uh with in particular utility anyway i've spent a lot of time going through the input section and so now it's time to wonder why would we do all i'm going to jump over here to a summary page and this was the cute little clip that i had thrown out there earlier but actually this page has quite a bit more on it i just want to show you all of the different features here as and then we'll go back and and look at it a little closer cumulative costs this is basically going to show us the 15-year life of that bus and we're gonna see the blue line is is gonna depict the diesel bus which costs cheaper in year one because it costs less to um and then the electric buses in orange twice as much even after we got an incentive added in there uh now as we go on though the diesel bus costs more to operate than the electric bus so we get out here in this particular case 10 or 11 we're going to cross over so so this is a pretty picture the actual numbers are in this table um we can see that the diesel bus over its costs a million six and uh and we got down to about a million four for the electric bus and this is without uh actually i i haven't squeezed a lot of incentives out of this it's pretty obvious i think at this point that electric buses typically have a higher upfront cost but there are getting to be some pretty lucrative incentives that might change how this plays out um so so i want you to look at that and then i will scroll over here please lose my video if anybody's watching me but that's good um so we have a second table this looks very similar and we've added social costs to this this is going to be the dollar value of estimated health by reducing greenhouse gases so i'm going to zoom back a little bit here and say this table below the first graph that we looked at is going to add all of the all of the different inputs and summary math together and and give us the data that goes behind this work this goes back one step further now we have what are the results of the input for bus one and bus two and then i was going to get over here to the social costs uh these again are are these are things like nox and particulate matter pm2 uh those sorts of things other than greenhouse gas emissions actually social costs includes greenhouse gas emissions too but a lot of the dollar value here comes out of health improvements um particularly by getting rid of particulate matter um we've again tried to try to incorporate everything that we thought would be a fair assessment that we could put into both the before and after bus um for those that are really curious about this there's probably an offline story we can talk about uh but uh the the origin of most of that data is going to come out of a federal tool called a fleet um i believe there's a second version of that now that that we used we caught that their their update happened right as we were doing this uh so so these are basic numbers about and we have one more tab over here that talks about our fleet carbon footprint um we start out with the tables these are these are annual figures so this is this is um you know per year our def or our diesel b5 bus was going to use a hot are going to emit 145 metric tons of carbon equivalent um our electric bus is going to be at 96. um this first graph to the to the right is the greenhouse gas emissions and the next one over to the right is the emission reduction or basically the so we can see here you the diesel is uh uh is the baseline the electric we saved 49 of those 145 metric tons um and then the lower part of this is for the 15-year life cycle of the bus um and i believe maybe i skipped over the 15-year story so let me go back and throw that in we know that uh that the buses are gonna be depreciated typically over a 12-year period uh we also know that a lot of people keep buses longer than the depreciation period we early on had to kind of nail down the life that was that was that's one of the things that we do not have flexibility in once we made the choice to model it this way everything else is scalable nicely but that had to be locked in we chose 15 years as kind of a happy medium combination sort of place and again unfortunately you can't change that i suppose you could maybe if you were hard and fast going to stop at 12 years uh you could uh you know you could do some proportion or something but but effectively we're going to compare all these buses on a 15-year life um that's depicted in in these cumulative graphs as well i think i thought i'm gonna i got a couple little other backup notes here how we're doing for time yeah we have a little bit of time so i'm going to say we talked about if you do have varying routes you can do more than one of these runs and then simply add the results i just talked about the 15-year life cycle lifespan being locked in you and i wanted to give another vote for talking to your electric utility early and often they might not only have experience with charging infrastructure but they also can advise you about how to best interact with them like would it be better to add your charging system to the current loads maybe establish a separate account for your transportation loans that that might even be a requirement if you're going to be trying to capture the clean fuels program credits you will need to know the quantity that actually went into your your transportation there's there's also great advice in that guidebook about the logistics of where you put charging and thinking about what's the value of parking your buses where they currently park versus you know maybe reconfiguring your lots as you uh as you go into this endeavor so again a lot of a lot of thought can be valuable in planning that charging infrastructure locations electrical loads how that align with your current loads or not and therefore maybe warrant a separate again talking with the utilities can't be uh i i don't think quite hard enough it's it's a very good a very good thing to do when you're looking at electrification and a bus evan um this christie would you mind um going in and doing an example of changing the utility and showing that the outputs that'd be great my my last bullet that i was about to blurt out was utility selection can affect you know it's gas numbers significantly so perfect timing so let's take a look at this and remind ourselves that we're looking at the diesel vernon b5 uh 145 metric tons and electricity only creating 96 tons or saving 49 of the 145 tons now let's go back to the input page so we were saving half of our half of our greenhouse gas emissions and that was using pacific power as our now i happen to say and you probably it's probably not practical to move around uh from utility utility uh but just to show kind of an extreme case i'm gonna now say we're talking about a bus fleet in eweb down in eugene uh an e-web now if we go back to the carbon footprint um and this was the first call i got from somebody asking questions about our and they looked at this and there's 145 an electric is like hardly anything and they thought surely something must be wrong so that's why i want to underline this uh the utility that you're buying your electricity from matters um in this case they're saving 144 or you know in the upper 90 uh percentile of the emissions going from a b5 regular diesel bus to an electric bus so so what utility fuels your fleet will have a difference on your greenhouse gas emissions due to another project that the department has electricity resource mix we already had that data so that was pretty easy to bring into this tool and make that variance uh you know very tunable you can pick your exact utility um again if you have eweb is an extreme example because they buy power from bonneville and they also have some of their own renewables they're i think maybe one of the cleaner electrical sources uh that we have we can go back and try another one just for fun i guess so let's see what happens if we if we put in mickmanville for instance oh they're very clean too okay i i'm not doing a good job at picking ones that are varying but the the bottom line here uh some of our utilities here in oregon get the advantage of buying bonneville power",

County they've taken um great steps to quantify that impact and they also work very closely with staff and our elected officials we have a formal agreement their application will come before you rather soon that gives the county the comfort that that exact number is the correct number and this one um seemed not not completely arbitrary but it's not as quantifiable as another project so um again moral countyy is very supportive of this it's really good business for the underlying farmers and the land owners we just think that there is so much to be considered by setting a president with Goal three we'd encourage you to think about that and maybe give some direction to staff in the developer um to formalize that mitigation program happy to answer any questions questions thank you Miss mavit thank you Cameron Krebs thank you chairman oh sorry you have the floor all right thank you chairman uh I my name is Cameron Krebs uh c m e r o n prbs k r BS spelled on the bottom of the sheet included with my email that's being passed out right now I live here in bourman uh I am a resident of Maro County I'm a fifth generation uh livestock producer in Maro County today my comments are neutral in your guys' decision on sighting Wagon Wheel Trail solar and any future solar projects in the future I come forth as a resident of this community that lives here and drinks the water here and I ask that we site these solar Farms with the highest environmental standard going forward presented to you today is by the sixth generation of my family is what I see out there on the landscape we have solar Farms that are being sided with a bare Earth approach since the Dust Bowl our government has strived to incorporate organic matter and residual residue on our soils to incorporate clean water infiltration protect from wind erosion uh as well as water runoff and discharge the useful life of a solar farm is 50 years what is 50 years of continuous chemical use going to do to our local um challenges including our content our current groundwater issues that we face I think there are honest great Solutions as presented in evidence below that we can site these solar Farms on our landscape in the Columbia Basin that have the resilience that provide habitat that provide clean water infiltration into our Upland watersheds and protect our local communities one of my major concerns uh is that in the permit there is currently no talk about harvesting out any of the nitrates in the Farmland second um is that the noxious weed plan is although addressed I would think that would be an excellent place that we stabilize the soil profile before we go into construction of solar farms for its long-term uh impacts and that would reduce the control and spread of noxious weeds Aid in the control of noxious weeds and reduce the spread and opportunity for them to flourish on this landscape second I could not find in the 320 pages except on page 110 which is actually in the go 3 exemp tion where it stated what the site was going to be like post Construction in the operational phase we have a very delicate ecosystem here we only get a limited amount of rainfall we need to collect every drop we can and ensure that it gets transferred into our water cleanly the fire provision section states that it's a 5 foot minimum fire break and as you guys know uh when the Sherman County Fire the Fatal file two years ago came it easily was jumping roads across that entire landscape the dot fire last year in adjoining click attat County moved considerable miles in matter of minutes 5 foot minimum fire break around a site that's generating energy is not sufficient I would encourage you to ENC enlarge that second I think we can change the design of these solar farms in our in our dry Aid ecosystem to make them more resilient to fire to protect those that live on the edges and our infrastructure that's outside of the facilities lastly is the goal three exemption I think it's uh I would like to ask that the gift or the allocated offset to the goal three which is a $170,000 gift to OSU with very specific Dryland wheat research earmarked be stricken and opened up to Agri takes goal three is to keep agricultur land in agriculture there is a wonderful opportunity to study the opportunities that exist in agreable takes going forward into the future uh there is going to be more permits in front of you guys coming forward I think Solar Development in the Columbia Basin is relatively new we have made some mistakes in the past I think there's a wonderful opportunity to really build solar Farms if we're going to item out here that are resilient that improve our ecological system that provide habitat for our Birds our nesting Birds our migratory birds and continue to keep our vibrant agricultural community alive thank you guys for your time today uh and I would be happy to take any questions that you might have second I do want to State for the record we currently operate a company called kreb solar grazing it's listed there uh any perceived beneficial interest I'm trying to declare that I'm here today because I don't believe we should have bare Earth in my County thank you thank you Mr KBS any questions Vice chair Conan thank you um Cindy Condon for the record thank you for being here and being so passionate um question for you with respect to the um G three exemption in the Oregon State um allocation I just want to make sure I understand what you're suggesting is that it not just be for Dryland wheat but also be for photo Vol AG Agro volic or um no Dryland wheat and only thank you uh I don't I'm on whoever established where that money how much money was coming which I think was previously stated and where it should go to be the offset I wasn't involved in that but what I know today is that if we're going to offset removing a Farmland that there are models of agots that can be developed that would make a more logical sense in my mind to all allocate OSU to use the F money in what they see is the best interest that future might be Dryland we research breeds for the land we do have left but it also could be to support the new emerging industry of agots whether that's pollinator habitat understanding vegetated response to um daylight stress and nutrient uptakes livestock raising Andor Beyond and that's what I'm asking that the gift be or the amount can be considered to be more broad spectrum of what the future of the county is going to need from our egg extension thank you for that and do you have written comment is it just oral comments your currently today it's only oral comments I struggle to get my passion into writing we did get this and that was submitted to the record so on the last thing the two solar Farms are 38.6 miles apart thank you for your time just Shar can you hold on one second yes sir if you allow me I I do have a question absolutely so for the record Tod corette um you had mentioned nitrate harvesting um is did i k that correctly yes so I'm not familiar with that term and since you know in case you don't put it on the record it would be helpful for me to understand exactly what that means well I'm not certain it has an official definition but as I Define it the top foot of our agricultural ground that has been in production Dryland wheat should be checked and compared to our native range land and if there is a significant difference in nitrogen then we should look at extracting that nitrogen from the soil to stabilize it as we go into the operational years of the solar farm my concern is that if we one of the receding mitigation protocols is to recede to its pre-established use if it was Dryland wheat phow its pre-established use would be phow so now we add rainwater to Bare Earth the nitrogens can only go one way and that's down so I'm just asking that we look at this picture and we try to create an ecological system underneath the solar panels that is healthy for our our landscape and and providing benefit last thing I breathe oxygen so do you that only comes from photosynthesis so why can't we catch sunlight to charge our cell phones and grow grass to make oxygen somewhere in there there's got to be a better balance than bare herb thank you sir thanks thank you appreciate it Sam Meyers yeah thank you Sam Myers 68453 little Butter Creek Road Hepner Oregon uh yeah I appreciate I too am super concerned about the ground contamination uh it's difficult for me to Fathom that that has not been fully addressed I talked to multiple multiple developers who could not answer that question what happens when a fire moves into a solar array what's left on ground if you guys can't if you don't know the answer to that then there's I don't know I don't know what's to talk about because it's like it's a abject failure it's a der elction of of pursuit to put solar panels in this area of Marl County especially Central Marl County because there's going to be a fire come through at some point and if you don't know what's going to be left on the ground if the ground is is unproduced because it's so toxic that the plants will absorb the toxicity and uh make the seeds dangerous consume uh and you've just ruined rued a fire of that size is going to be so difficult to fight because you you're dealing with panels everywhere uh is it would be a a a nightmare if you don't know what a fire's going to do in this array in this area then you have no business discussing this as a renewable energy I was approached by multiple developers wanting to do this and as soon as they couldn't answer that question I said hey I'm I think I'm out not to mention the Absurd subsidies that they were getting this is everybody should know this is just a sham he said what do you want what do you want per acre per year said what do you want I said I don't know I'll take the current current panel dollar figure and I'll multiply it by three so I said $1,200 per acre per year he's like I think I can do that I'm like wow so this is all coming through the Biden administration's infrastructure Bill and I'm like wow what",

        "text": " they've had another RFI this February and then they had a notice of intent this summer and where we're at with it is that we're waiting on the actual funding opportunity announcement or foa to drop so we've started to hear some details along the way from doe about what it's going to look like but of course they've said this could change at any moment so we're all on tensor hooks waiting for that foa to really know what the opportunity will specifically look like however some things are coming into view that seem like they're gonna they're gonna be the case so for example uh we've heard that it looks like uh there's the possibility for 500 million um to one billion dollars per Hub um that's a lot of money and this is all part of the Doe's hydrogen shot so they've got uh this goal of getting to one dollar per one kilogram of clean hydrogen in one decade so that's their one one one goal and whereas in Oregon for example Odo has been working on a renewable hydrogen doe approaches this uh technology agnostic uh they're looking specifically at greenhouse gas emissions to determine what is quote unquote clean hydrogen and so that means that they're open to you know ever feedstocks including renewable electricity nuclear powered electricity or nuclear or thermal energy from nuclear and fossil fuels specifically natural gas paired with carbon capture and Storage um so they're allowing all of those Technologies to uh compete for this funding uh but they do have a carbon intensity threshold so for the Hub applications it's expected that proposals are going to have to address each part of the value chain so this is include the production of hydrogen uh the transport of it from production to end user storage along the way and then the end user part of the hydrogen life cycle so we refer to these as make move store and use so a competitive Hub application is going to successfully address all of those and the reason for this in the you know in the the way that they've built this opportunity is is that their overall goal is to really try to create that Marketplace for clean hydrogen kind of from Whole cloth and so you may have heard that there's sometimes a chicken and egg issue identified with this Emerging Market where it's difficult to Get It produced because there are no end users but there's no end users because nobody's producing it and so this is their approach to try to address both ends of so that foa that we're all waiting on uh we're expecting that to they uh they do we said September or October so we're waiting on that I've heard all manner of rumor about when that might um and at least what they identified this summer as what the likely application process would be is that the first step is that you would have to submit a concept paper and you would have I believe probably four to six weeks to turn that around and then doe would review all of those concept papers and then invite uh certain uh Hub proponents to do a full application um so if you weren't invited um you know you can submit an application but I don't think your chances are going to be great so as I mentioned doe has done some Outreach on uh clean hydrogen in general so this one of their earlier rfis this was one of the findings slides that they published uh and this shows information from all of the responses that they got and you can expect that um this is going to be fairly representative of the breadth of applicants that uh that we're gonna see for this funding opportunity pardon me as I mentioned it's a lot of money we're expecting it to be highly so there's already been announcements from a number of states or groups of States uh my understanding is California is doing their own work um we've got some New England states together some Central U.S states um but as you can see here what they found out from their RFI for the Pacific Northwest was that there was a lot of interest among tribal communities around ports and then of course one of our great competitive advantages for this region is are plentiful renewable electricity resources uh so here are some specifics about what doe learned so certainly they heard a lot about uh potential sites in Washington and Oregon so these include Port of Tacoma Richland Boardman and Centralia that there is a fair bit of emission reduction potential here doing no small part to our uh clean electricity um and that there are some opportunities for co-location including on tribal land so before I dive into the organization created to lead a Pacific Northwest Hub application I want to pause and see if there are any questions about just the opportunity in general Rebecca I don't see any questions feel free to shoot your questions into the chat or even just shoot into the chat that you have a question and I'll make sure to get you on the list whenever Rebecca takes her puzzles hey here I was at a conference when a very highly placed us doe person adamantly corrected me when I called this a grant that I think she said they were going to be cooperative agreements and that was obviously a really big deal to her I don't totally know what the difference is but I just thought I'd mention that thank you Ken um uh uh Cooperative agreement okay um Kate you have a question oh you're on mute sorry I I'm really good at zoom and I'm not good at WebEx yet thank you um I just wanted to respond to that I think the main difference just is context between a grant and a Cooperative agreement is a grant is typically when a funding agency says here's money you direct the project didn't tell us and report back to us but you really have ownership and Cooperative agreements have far more input oversight and engagement by the program managers of the federal funding agency oh Michelle just put that in there so essentially it just means that there's a lot more engagement by Doe in the planning and design of the work as it continues versus where they just say here's your money go do great things thank you for that clarification Kate and Michelle um you know and like I said I went over the information here pretty briefly you know if you go back to the notice of intent there's more information on their proposed phases of of the of the Cooperative agreement there is an expectation that there will be a 50 match requirement uh there's a lot more detail in there um so certainly follow up with me if you'd um like more information on that um and then I see I saw a question about the slide deck and we um we will be able to make that available I will just raise one you know one question right now or one concern is that so our overall goal with this convening was to you know really get Oregon stakeholders informed and ready to participate and also to get your feedback and ensure that this Hub opportunity is you know in in the vision that we're hoping so because this is such a competitive opportunity we're trying to walk the line between being public and open but then also trying to ensure that we're not you know giving away the store to our competitors and so there's nothing in this presentation today that um that I think would be problematic to um to have the the slides released publicly going forward though and especially when we're in the discussion this might be an idea to talk about is kind of how do we potentially have discussions uh looking forward that might include information that isn't necessarily confidential but is sensitive in that you know it is a little bit competitive with other potential hubs so I'll leave that there Rebecca we have another question from um well the Hub funding required 50 50 match with regional entities uh Tom so my understand again you know it'll be final when we see the foa but they have said that they were they were expecting a 50 match and that could not include any other federal government um funds so the match um you know it I think the expectation is is that the match would come from you know kind of be split across the project proponents but that hasn't been finalized either as we um as we you know as the iija came out and the understanding of this huge opportunity uh became clear before the association was formed uh there were already discussions going on between Washington and Oregon uh these were led by an organization called charge which is uh an innovation cluster public private I believe I'm I hope I'm um describing it correctly but and it's associated with WSU in Washington and so charge was leading the conversation Odo uh and a few other Oregon entities were um and then Jay Inslee uh sent a letter uh about the opportunity and directed Washington Department of Commerce to create an organization which also was in a law passed in Washington and funding allocated for Washington to create this organization uh the public the Pacific Northwest hydrogen Association um with the goal that it would coordinate the developments of the Hub proposal and then if the proposal were successful and received funding that the association would then also be the the lead on on managing that contract so uh the association was incorporated in April in Washington with two million dollars in funding from uh the Washington State Legislature um the uh Association is staffed by the Washington Department of Commerce uh it has an executive board and and I can't believe I forgot the word um anyway and a committee which I'll go over in a moment advisory committee thank you I'm under caffeinated I apologize so um as the association was putting together its executive board and the advisory committee uh Washington Commerce staff put together a request for information or an RFI uh to start getting a sense of which what what kind of Interest was out there in projects um the executive board was formed in June Otto holds a seat on the board uh our agency director Janine Benner and uh Janine is also the vice chair of the so the board started meeting uh in July and so the meetings thus far have been focused on not only the structure of the association in terms of Anti-Trust statements and you know incorporation and officers but also you know further development of concept ideas for the Hub uh drafting grading project grading criteria uh getting an m o contractor secured and um and looking to open up a second uh so Jessica I feel like I've seen some questions in the chat are these um clarifying questions that we should pause for now we do have one additional question excuse me from Jed and he asks um if we could describe our interaction with Washington a little bit um we're I'm happy to so as as the uh has the bill in the Washington legislature that ended up you know getting the funding for the association and as the association kind of began to coalesce as an idea and then",

        "text": " megawatt win facility in Morrow County it was constructed in about 12 months operational by December during that time frame up until today no violations have been issued to that Facility by fsec or any other state we have not received any complaints through pre-construction all the way into operation related to site certificate complaints we were made aware of a complaint for the Wheat Ridge tree facility at the county level that was we believe is outside of council jurisdiction it has to do with um sort of annoyance of light Flicker at Night by the flashing on the turbines but we have been working with nextera and asking if they respond to the County's concerns and they have been very responsive so just pointing that again as experience with the LLC to parent structure where to date for that project we've had success the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three is a 50 megawatt solar facility in Morrow County it was kind of started Construction in 2021 and was completed by 2022 a similar situation where we had no incidents reported for that facility to date you know corrective actions written corrective actions or violations for that facility and then State Line win projects for their experience as relevant they've been in operation for over 10 years so they've actually had more history to have incidents being reported incidents like fire Transformer failure even Tower collapse and blade failure issue Although our records show that all of those incidences were reported in in compliance with the standard and were resolved Timely one of the issues that we point out in the order that was an attachment to the staff report that we are aware of in terms of their kind of compliance history is that LLC is owned by nextera were issued quite a hefty fine from U.S fish and wildlife service um but that they admitted to the issue and have been working to pay the fine so we have recommended the council find this experience demonstrates that they would continue to have adequate experience to meet the standard any questions on organizational thank you I don't really have a question I have a comment I I actually um supported this of this for the reasons um stated in the record um what I am concerned about is our rule I guess for um organizational expertise and uh the specific language of applicant who becomes the certificate holder and the parent company is not recognized at all um and I we have other projects that certainly have commented on uh related to that this is different to me because it is an operating entity it will have um and there is an operational history with the same structure so it is it presents different things so think of the work I'm sure that the presentation to fill that thank you for your comment thank you Cindy okay moving over to the other standard that's reviewed in a transfer Amendment retirement and financial assurance just to go over the the language of the standards so council is obligated to find that the new owner has the ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition at the end of the facility's useful life and an ability to obtain a bond or letter of credit in an amount informed deemed satisfactory by Council so for this transfer request we aren't re-evaluating whether the decommissioning estimate previously approved is adequate no changes have triggered a re-evaluation of tasks and um so then we go to uh legal opinion letter that they provided in their transfer request to evaluate whether they can take on this project without violating any of their other Bond provisions and they provided that from Squire patent Boggs we also have an existing bond in place from the existing certificate holder using an entity that's approved by Council it's Fidelity and deposit company of Maryland and they have affirmed they've been the new owner that they can get that Bond reissued under the new name in a period of three so I think those are the facts we have to review and with that we have recommended Council find that the new owner would still be able to meet the standard um Cindy Condit for the record survey um Sarah on the ability to obtain Bond charity Bond issued by Missouri American Insurance company so as the issued is it issued is that the bottom issue today that will be replaced by the um this is the bond we have on file today and it would be issued to the new owner but same form should be essentially transported right they're recognizing that it works thank you so now I think you have the three options we recommended in the staff report that the transfer request be approved if that's approved in the final order is issued then an amended site certificate with new owner would be incorporate it and then you have two other options to adopt approve the request for changes or to deny thank you Cindy this is Cindy at all a little different request for the transfer is recommended by scam okay this is Ken I'd like to insert if I may before seconding that because of the last council meeting in November during uh Council Grove presentation on the case law we said and um we highlighted the council needs to be very clear with reasoning for our decision and explain reasons for our decision rather than just making as presented by staff so this is going to be duplicative and we need to decide that they're doing really want to do it like this or because of the value that Council okay Patrick Brown would get out of this it would help in the future so here we go here's the time it's maybe too long wouldn't it I don't know so the transfer Amendment request requires we find legal owner satisfies the requirement of the organizational expertise the retirement Financial assurance and the mission of carbon dioxide standards um well the carbons didn't apply at the civilian energy facility so we move on to organizational expertise a letter from the current site certificate holder to confirm is that fans that II Men project will be assigned to then cycle to win LLC and demonstrate that it will be in control and possession of the facility and will die but all the terms and conditions of the seventh amended site certificate and account for previously had found that the parent accompanying dexterra energy resources knows that you have the organizational team to construct operating retirement control facility and complying for Council standards in addition to the side certificate regarding the retirement Financial Assurance because all assets of the advanced signal to the unit will be transferred to the new owner and because the new owner is owned by the same parent company and it's not individual Americans a reasonable depending the bond or whether credit performance required by the site certificate so Madam chair it's important I go I moved the council approved the visit request to transfer ownership because it's in compliance so the council standards that end up will be entitled to possession of control or control of the site or facility and described in cyber certificate okay so I'm going to look over at the council and Todd to see just I think that was the perfect time to ask questions so we've got a motion and then Clint excuse me can't provide it um rationale for the motion when you gave us our presentation uh last meeting there's that your intention that we provide such detail it's certainly helpful if anyone in the future is trying to determine why did Council take an action that it took can't provide an explanation as to why people use counselors would be a proven this request Cindy so can I withdraw my motion and defer to cancer or friendly Amendment yeah okay so uh thank you for that because I yeah thank you yes all spelled out so anyone else have any I used to be a Kent do I need a second there needs to be accepted yeah if I made one of them if if you're going to continue this in the future which I think is a good idea you know the motion stands this is just an explanation okay okay thank you we have a motion we have a second yes Scott just for clarification for the record talk on that so with that in mind um does that become the motion the Deutsche chair how red or is that uh explanation that goes into the minutes I would consider it an explanation for why Council Rule people with their event but presumably their role city has made emotion can't this explained this is why I would be second again and then everyone else can so the motion for the record would be the same the motion itself you know slip in the minutes would reflect the justification correct that's correct I just want to be clear to make sure because I'm going to need to get your handwritten notes by sharing and make sure that we have that different record we'll have to but it's easier thank you thank you very much forward so your work was not I was listening okay so we have a motion we have a second any additional comments hearing that Mr secretary please call the roll and Byron yes Cindy Condon yes and Jenkins yes Mercy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you that was extremely helpful thank you Sarah thank you very much and uh that will include agenda Item B uh we are relatively On Target but before we have our um our next agenda item I just want to check with council members would you rather take a break now is everybody good everybody need a break okay so we did we could just take a five minute break to prepare before we dive into agenda item C all right the time is now 9 46 so we could be back in five minutes then one that would be 12. just before you grab your things it's nice to see you and not just on thank you so we are up to agenda item C this is a signing table overview an information item that Oriana magnera from the energy climate and transportation program manager with Verde is going to present an update on a stakeholder working group that's been discussed in the stating citing process in Oregon orianna are you with us I am here um and I'll be uh so for the record my name is orianna moniera uh chair Grail Vice chair Howe members of the energy facilities citing Council um we're going to switch up our order a little bit because we've got a presenter who needs to drop at 10. so I'll do a very brief intro we'll dive into something that seems very wonky and specific and then we'll pull back out so just a brief note about the work that we've done doing uh Verde thousand friends of Oregon and renewable Northwest have been uh helping to convene a conversation about the citing process in Oregon bringing together a number of stakeholders uh from a variety of different perspectives who are impacted by citing in the state to have dialogue about what's working what may not be working where the challenges and opportunities are and where we can make",

lead us to being able to announce the awards for that particular set of opportunity announcements and those projects that get an award will then enter into a performance agreement with the department of energy once that performance agreement is in they complete the project or in the case of planning grants they would complete the print the planning of the project we would go through a review process once the project is completed which would include on-site inspections for construction grants and if the on-site inspection final meet all of the requirements within the performance then we would make the grant payment and it's very similar for planning grants except that we would not have the on-site inspection and with that i will pass it back over to thanks rob um so i think as rob uh the process that we came up with in the program design working together with the advisory committee is very closely reflected in the rules but just a few words about what the draft rules can include there are definitions many of those definitions are taken straight from the bill but there are a few in addition the program process is largely reflected in the structure of the rules starting with opportunity announcements and then there's essentially two parallel streams in the rules for the planning grants and the project development grants so for each of those is a stream that starts at the application then eligibility and complete linux review competitive review the performance agreement stage and then we also have some language around amending a performance agreement things like extending a deadline or if there are some changes to the actual renewable energy project that need to be reflected in the performance there's some language around compliance and inspections by odo and then we also have some language in its own separate section of the rules around equity metrics equity metrics were mentioned in the bill as being a component that odo is required to develop in coordination with the environmental justice task force so i think that concludes my remarks just on the draft rules if you want to go to the next slide rob and i will talk a little bit about uh this formal rulemaking so this right now is the time and place that is set for the public rulemaking hearing the purpose is to take public comments um on the proposed permanent rules which would establish the community renewable energy grant program which is created by sections 29-32 of house bill 2021 adopted by the 2021 the filing caption for this rulemaking establishing community renewable energy product project grant program under house bill 2021 from 2021. notice for today's hearing was filed with the oregon secretary of state on december 22nd 2021 and was published in the january 2022 oregon bulletin forgive me i've got two screens so if it looks a little funny like i'm looking off to the side i'm just looking at my other screen see if i can make it look a little bit better so this hearing will be sorry that's not better will be conducted according to the oregon administrative procedures act ors chapter 183 and the attorney general's model rules in addition to the opportunity to

want to jump to a particular issue or um expand this or the conditions the conclusions of law but i just wanted to go over this because this is just a when navigating these documents okay so now are we back to uh everybody can see my screen this is uh this is cindy yes carolyn thank you very much for that little tutorial okay good thank you yeah and if uh if we get to it and you know if you have your documents open and you want a reminder about how to access or find those we can totally go back and do that but this is you know it's also something that for the members of the public um you know who track our projects we really want um we really want the information to be navigable we know there's a lot of it and we just want to help people be able to find what they're looking for okay so we are reviewing the proposed for uh the obsidian solar center the applicant is obsidian solar llc uh the proposed facility is a 400 megawatt solar pv photovoltaic energy facility that's located in north lake um lake county is quite long and large which is approximately eight miles from christmas valley within a 3 900 approximately 6.1 square mile site um the site boundary includes five underlying property owners and then within uh within one mile of the site boundary there's 17 residential so the description of the facility as i noted it's a solar pv the energy generating facility includes modules posts inverters and transfer number units and the electro collect electrical collection system as council is aware an energy facility in your statutes is the energy facility and it's related or supporting facilities so related or supporting facilities include four um up to four one acre collected collect collector substations a three acre 115 to 500 kilovolt step-up substation which means it's stepping up the power from 115 kv to 500 up to two operation operation and maintenance buildings access and service roads fencing around the entire and two miles of 115 uh gentile transmission line which would connect the generating equipment to an existing and the energy generated to an existing 500 kv pge uh transmission line um the relator supporting facilities also include 550 megawatts of dispersed or centralized flow battery technology technology storage systems so in this figure here and i know you read all of these little call outs but i selected this figure because it's basically a layout what the generating equipment would be and where the substations would be this here and there's other figures too this is the transmission line and then this is the existing pg e transmission line you'll notice that there's these little blocks where there's no yellow solar those blocks as we'll address later underneath primarily the council's fish and wildlife habitat standard and council's uh cultural historic and archaeological resources standard these are avoidance areas where the applicant is um going to avoid sensitive resources this is uh the procedural history slide as council can see back in 2018 the applicant submitted its notice of intent uh i'm going to remind council here that back in the notice of intent phase the applicant was proposing about a 6 000 acre solar generating facility but due to comments and review um from the applicant's coordination with tribal governments and other reviewing including the department of state lands for wetlands uh the applicant actually removed 2 000 acres of uh their proposal to what uh council is reviewing today and that was to avoid impacts to sensitive resources so uh back in let's see 2019 we deemed the application complete and then in uh the department issued the draft proposed order um which the draft proposed order typical of all dpos that the department issues is really staff's first cut at making recommendations to council findings of facts and conclusions of law with the inclusion of site certificates to meet particular standards now there is a gap in between the ep or sorry dpo issuance and when we actually had the public hearing on the dpo and as everybody's aware this was just the onset of the coronavirus pandemic so we really um we made several attempts to have a public hearing on the dpo um and just were really mindful of keeping the safety of staff and the public in consideration but also making sure that we met all of the requirements um for the hearing under council's rules and statutes so in july of 2020 we had a in-person and remote public hearing on the dpo uh council reviewed the dpo in august of and then let's see in october we issued the proposed order and notice of the contested case um there was a full contested case proceeding on the applicator on the proposed order which was um uh led by uh joe allen who's a administrative law judge at the office of administrative hearings uh this concluded with his issuance of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order um in january of 2022 and which leads us to today where we're reviewing the proposed order and um council's uh possible final decision of the site certificate so i'm going to go over and this kind of correlates with uh the staff report so the scope of re review so i'm going to go through the proposed order and i've certain items uh i'm certainly not going to walk through all of the conditions because that would just it would be a long time to do all of that so i've just selected some items that i think council would be interested in and that i think are so if as we're going through there's something that you want to talk about or for me to expand on just let me know and i can do it so as we went over uh council reviewed the dpo in august of 2020 and provided input and comments uh on the issues that were raised on the record of the dpo many of the many of those issues were carried forward into the contested case which jesse is going to go over later after my presentation um and i'm sorry just as jesse radcliffe as council's aware but for the record is uh is um council's council uh their doj attorney from the department of justice so i want to make sure that council understands the scope of review so following or during my presentation you will have an opportunity to take an informal vote on whether to adopt modify or reject the proposed order if council determines that modification or rejection rejection of findings and conclusions of law are appropriate it must be based or are maybe inappropriate if basically if council would like to modify the proposed order it must be based on a determination that the applicant has failed to demonstrate a preponderance of evidence to satisfy an applicable standard under review which i'll talk about for ponderance of um within my next slide so um i'm going to continue so the council's general standard of review requires the council to find that a preponderance of evidence on the record supports the conclusion that the proposed facility will comply with essex statutes the citing standards adopted by council and that the facility complies with all other statutes and administ administrative rules applicable to the issuance of the site certificate what does preponderance of evidence mean it essentially it's more likely than not that the evidence proves that the standard is met and um jesse will likely expand on this um in his presentation so under the general standard of review the department recommends uh and also imposes uh conditions one through ten um these include mandatory and site specific conditions that are required in all site certificates so uh so for the mandatory insights there may not be the recommend in front of them because they're required to be in there um and as uh what you'll find in this proposed order and i think uh in other orders is that there are mandatory that relate to the structural standard and there's mandatory conditions that also you know directly relate to the retirement and financial assurance standard the department recommends or imposes those conditions underneath those standards so they don't necessarily appear here however there's several other um conditions uh under general standard of review um where the mandatory or specific conditions are imposed uh the mandatory condition imposed under recommended general standard of review condition one requires that the specific certificate holder to begin construction on the facility no later than the date no later than the construction beginning date specified by council on the site in this condition the department recommends a timeline that's consistent with previously approved facilities noting that the applicant may begin after the issuance of the site certificate but of course pending compliance with all pre-construction conditions um let's see uh general standard recommended general standard of condition three um i think that this this is an important condition um uh and this kind of ties to the site certificate but underneath this condition the certificate holders required to design construct operate and retire and retire the facility substantially as described in the site in general in generating the site certificate the department basically the facility description from the introductory part of the proposed order or final order and um and puts that into the site certificate and this is so when dwayne and the compliance program um is out on site during construction or operation they have an idea of what what is what is constructed and what operation activities are and also what retirement active activities would be um the recommended general standard of review condition six is also a mandatory condition i just plucked this one out to focus that um council is aware that re-vegetation is uh commonly and in this case is addressed under the fish and wildlife habitat standard but there's also a you know as a backstop or additionally supplementing to a mandatory condition that requires re-vegetation on the site um the council also has um well under oar 345 2500 6 sub 10 is a a requirement that the council includes as conditions in the site all representations and and supporting all representations in the application and supporting record the council deems to be binding commitments made by the as necessary to avoid or minimize a potential impact so this is interesting because in the presentation there are conditions that appear that don't necessarily weren't necessary to meet the standard but were an applicant's representation to minimize or avoid an impact uh does council want me to us like just want me to like continue or do you want me to pause at the end of like does council have any questions about the general standard of review helen this is marcy and i'd advise you to pause and",

off and I put it on my my beat up bottle that I've had since 2015 we'll do a little tutorial later after board session for everybody so so good morning commissioners uh for the record Brian May Environmental Services uh division manager out at Public Works and with me I have Rachel vanart Maran County Public Works ancy Orton Marian County Public Works and as mentioned we're here to uh be really excited about the fact that we're bringing a proclamation forward for Earth Day for uh April 22nd 2024 here here in in Maran County um the first Earth day was celebrated April 22nd of 19 1970 uh the goal was to inspire the appreciation of the nation's natural resources uh the principles of the first Earth Day you know now almost 54 years ago was to create environmental awareness and action Inspire uh scientific discoveries and progress and ensure that environmental environment was recognized more on a a national level than just a local level uh the Maring County Environmental Services team which is here with you today uh has been working very hard to engage with our community and more of a monthl long his commiss me in earthday is an everyday event but we've uh set up a campaign for a month long uh to basically illustrate waste reduction improve our water quality and highlight our Maran County Parks that's all what's comprised with Environmental Services uh so without further Ado I'll turn it over to to Rachel and team to discuss kind of what we have planned for this year's event out at spons Landing all right uh thank you and good morning and thank you for having us um as commissioner Cameron said yes every day is Earth Day uh for us though tying into the national movement on the uh 22nd is important uh we though feel that the proclamation every year here with the Board of Commissioners kind of kicks off our event and this year it will be at spong's landing park on Friday April 26 from 3: to 7: uh we look at this as an opportunity for uh us to showcase our water waste and Parks divisions it is also our largest event where we are able to connect with the community do some Outreach and education and um get people to learn a little bit about what we do every day in a fun and engaging way um folks you know kind of learn a lot from us about contamination of waste streams about our Parks but being out in nature and getting to do it is a great way for people to feel connected to us um every year we have a theme change on um this year uh we looked at building a brighter future last year of course we went back to the 70s this year we're going back to the future um part of that for us is making sure that we are highlighting the things that people can do every day so doing reuse reducing repairing and Reinventing and so our activities throughout the day we'll highlight that we'll be able to have our partners and ourselves there to share a little bit about ways that folks can get connected of course um like Brian said our event doesn't start just day of we've kind of had this month-long campaign um part of it is bringing back our passport to sustainability the passport is an event that people can do pre- Earth Day um where they get to participate um educate and cultivate through a series of different um events surveys um getting out and doing some Hands-On visiting and getting points for that that they can then redeem for environmentally and sustainable prizes and should we let's can we start the passport we're going to show this off because um I have to thank yansy and Stephanie and Chelsea for every year building this better and better um we get so many just compliments and people getting excited about this um how it works is people can log in to the passport they choose the activity that they would like to participate in um they complete it and they send in um either a photo or that they have completed it um in through the website should we try the let's yeah let's do an activity well we won't do an activity but we'll we'll Pretend We're doing an activity we can see and oh yes and we get a leaderboard which um if you love gamification Andor you're competitive this might be a passort for you so these are completed activities yes so oh already we have a lot of completed um these are we have both two sets um one is a regular passport and then we have a kids passport which is a little more geared down for um the smaller people in our life who can still get to do it um right before Earth Day we've had 91 activities completed you designed that kids passport just for me right that is and we will even include an extra Tut tutorial about water bottles and water bottle stickers so but those are Hardy once you get them on as commissioner bethl sees um once you wash them they're not coming off they're pretty yeah they're stick like a vinyl sticker instead of a paper sticker so um we made them Hardy so they last this year um again you know if you can see the scavenger hunts at the local park um we're just looking for things to get people engaged a tree with green leaves I can definitely do this scavenger hunt how easy it is I'm just saying that's all I can see on that but if you're in the canyon it's hard to find maybe not in the canyon if you're in the canyon it's hard to find a green tree there's some in the RV par I'm teasing uh so that is our passport um again the other piece that is great for this H can we do the RSVP on here um this has been really fun for us to see this grow every year we have an RSVP system um of people who are planning on coming to kind of give us a little bit of a hint um so far 230 yinks um you should have a little box that says who's coming for the ice cream well I feel like everyone everyone is coming for the ice cream um the rest of it is all bonus for that but definitely U we won't lie people do love doing our scavenger hunts they love talking to our partners um but the the baby goats and the ice cream sometimes just steal the bear come to this act and if not we should make that happen that would be a good one I mean come on yeah my husband um when he us twerk fires in uh Idaho was actually Smoky on every parade so I may volun show he's getting volun told next year so perect yeah perfect so this this is a great event we are looking forward to seeing again we have people who have come the second year have told us they're going to be there the third year we're starting to see new community members but then we kind of also are getting friends that are supportive of Environmental Services and the things we do so with

        "text": " what needs mitigation and what. But she's got pictures, and so those will tell us what species they were and whether or not there's something that you would do mitigation for. If they were nuisance species that got removed, then there's not a mitigation requirement for those. And so that would be done as soon as this is approved, then we would be moving forward with that. If it's not approved, then we would be moving forward with ag use on the property. And there's fulfilled pasture criteria. There's not a mitigation criteria for either. So one way there's no mitigation criteria. And the other one that we'be moving forward with that with your local landscape architect, your county landscape architect, or arborist, whichever one it is, I'm not sure. But then I think that takes care of it. I mean, that addresses and I think that our time frme that we talked about to try to limit the amount of glare that does, you know, I mean, the lighting's lighting, even if you got a low lumen count on the outside of your fence, would, you know, I certainly agree with him. There should be a cutoff time. And so, you know, at the plan and zing here, and we agreed with that. So you. I think that criteria is already in here. So if there's anything additional, I'm happy to try to answer it. Any other questions for Mister Tailman? If not Mister Tailman. Thank you. Not right now. Yeah, thank you. So, Commissioner, this is one of those things. I hate this kind of thing. Cause if David and these folks would have came here beforehand and submitted this, and we would have had public input and been able to do it, I'd have probably been all for it, right? But I hate this. With all due respect, you know, when you go out there and build all that stuff without permits, you damn well know you need permits and you did it anyway, right? And you use the other stuff without permits. We told you that it did, right? I mean, it'code enforcement cases going back a long time. You took down all the trees. I mean, you did everything you could wrong. And now you want us to come back and approve it. Right. I mean, that's the bottom line. And I appreciate it. Cause all my kids played sports. I mean, I play sports. I love sports. Right. But this is frustrating. So, yeah. So I think the tree fund still needs to be paid if they took down the wrong trees. Make sure if you want to move forward this. I quite frankly think they should have to take the lights down, in all honesty. I mean, they're putting lights. I love the fact that David used rotary. Right. The lights are a thousand yards off of meryamp. Right. It's surrounded by, you know, the Greenway. There is no residential housing up against it. Right. I mean, you couldn't pick a better spot up against the high school, up against the greenway, up against anything else to compare it to. This is the exact opposite of that. It's up on 326. You're gonna have road glare when I drive by it. You can see it. Right. You know, up at Rakeley, the same thing where we build a sports pleex, we build it off. Right. Probably the only one that has a lot of glare to a neighborhood is bellevview, because of where it was situated. So I don't know. I still think that they should. If we do this, they should have to make the lights work and that they should have to buy, you know, sizable trees. You know, one of the things that I think we do too often is we let people buy little trees that are going to take five years to grow to actually shade. So the next five years, the folks that are the neighbors have to live with the glare from that park. And I don't know if Jim can, you know, fix some of that or moderate some of that. I don't know what they can put there for some of these. You know, when you put 30 foot lights up on front of somebody's house, I think it should have to shut down if we do allow it at 08:00 right. I mean, that's reasonable. Let you get kids to bed and everything else. And this is supposed to be from everything that I read in the report, if I'm not wrong, right, can. It s supposed to be a training facility and a couple scrimmages here and there. And I don't think we have to have tournaments on the weekends. They don't have the parking. They don't have the parking to put a tourament in this facility. So, quite frankly, I don't think we should allow them to do that. I don't know where they're gonna park, David? I don't know if you want toa tell me how you're gonna park that many vehicles, but I don't see it on this particular thing. Well, we're not talking about the same size tournaments that you would have out at Rotary. I mean, we would be limited to what we can park on the side. How many people can you park there, though? I really don't see it. So if you've got 36 kids, you might have as 40 to 50 cars. I'm just go going toa surmise it. If they come in, generally, you have more kids come to a car than parents separate coming to it. I'm just thinking if you got additional volunteers and things of that, generally it's the families that volunteer and participate in these. So, I mean, we would, they're going to go back and get all commercial building permits for all theseruct and would, I would point out that we are going. We are going to have. We can only have one conversation going on at a time. We do have to modify the lights commissioner s alley to meet the criteria of the code that's specified in here. I just don't know if you can, David. I hope you can. I guess we'll. If we approve it, we'll find out. Yes. So can we let Ken answer? Yeah. Are you going. You're gonna have to get all commercial building permits pulled for all the stuff that's built already, right? Correct. They will have to finish their permits. Condition number one says that a site plan has to be submitted and approved before any organized activities can happen on the site. So that would, if approved, encourage them to move quickly to get all that done. O commission Bryant, thank you for waiting. No worries. I mean, they are going to have to come into compliance. I mean, we heard what Mister Coulard said, that lighting is going to have to come into compliance. They're gonna have to do a site plan just like any other park does. They're going toa have to have designated parkingct. They're not going to be able to park back there along 71st. We do need to ask the question about why that fence is there. And I mean, looking at it, I don't think that they're going to be able to do some of the things that have been proposed because they're not going to have the space. Number one, they're not going to have ample parking. And I do think that they are going to have to put in plantings that are going to provide some kind of shade to that adjoining north property owner and I completely agree with what commissionisters Alex said. Using rotary as a comparison, that's like comparing apples to oranges. Well, Dalton woods backs up to Rotary park not after the greenway that, but greenway behind it. Mister, to you're better off. Our view, that is a space that's not available that we do tournaments at. I mean it's, you know, I wasn't comparing it to be exactly the exact type of location that we've got here. I certainly understand that. But when you look across the community at our park facilities and our recreation facilities, we certainly have those that back up. Thank you, mister. Til small lots for your comments. Thank you. But they're going toa have a lot of things that they're going to have to come into compliance with. And quite frankly, I hope they're able to, because I do want to see the facility be able to be provided for the kids out in this part of town. There are less amenities in the north part of the county for our children. So, I mean, and then I do agree. I'm certainly not gonna, I would not be in favor of extending the hour till 10:00 p.m. at night. And so commission alec, I mean, we can have some discussion about. Well, I want to hear, can we have Jim back up? I think we need to figure out from a buffer perspective, commissioner, what can we put there and what kind of timef frame that we can actually, because I don't like this type C buffer. With all due respect, I think we should put a buffer in there that's appropriate for this particular site. Okay. That block that are you familiar with, can we modify that? Oh, yeseah. Take place by way of buffering. We need a buffer that's gon toa be there in a reasonable amount of time. I don't know what to plant there or what we should ask because I don't think a typical type C buffer gets it done. In this case with 30, 40 foot lights. You're absolutely right. So with trees, the bigger they are, the more expensive they are. So you know that, right. We've planted a couple around the campus here lately that were rather expensive. Now those were top notch trees for a special occasion, so there's always that. But the Florida number one standards",

        "text": " reasons to exist so uh you know we that that is all part of the um micro sighting of the route to determine uh whether we're inside or outside the channel how deep the cable needs to be buried uh what resources natural or cultural or physical need to be avoided that whole thing and you know you literally go sort of i want to say mile by mile but it's actually more uh micro than that uh to determine the exact cable route and and how to kind of thread the needle in order to get the cable safely into the river minimize impacts and bring it up on shore i don't think i had anything else to add chris if you wanted to wrap up or open the floor for questions i guess well i'd be more than happy to take questions uh and hopefully i didn't go on too long uh i think what we're trying to impress uh first of all this is introductory worth it we're at the beginning of a long process we've already taken it through the feasibility stage with hdr find out whether there's any you know fatal flaws this is a technology that has been employed before many places around the world as well as a few places in the u.s we've got an experienced development team i should mention that hdr's colleagues out here in the east helped us with both of our projects so we're familiar with them they're familiar with the with the process as and i guess most importantly is that we we see that the need is there for transmission if that turns out to be incorrect we're not seeking to force a cable down the river just to have it there it has to meet a need and it has to be uh done right and done uh with a minimum of impact that's what we were able to accomplish in the neptune and the hudson projects that's what we're planning to do here uh it's going to be a long haul it's probably going to be what a year or so susie before you sort of uh uh see you know an official piece of paper from us with the with the application but uh when you do it will include an awful lot of information an awful lot of studies to indicate exactly what we plan to do and how we plan to do it so with that if there's any questions that i could answer to be happy to thank you does anyone have any questions your ground fire away cindy thank you cindy condon i am curious we have seen of late um things may be technically um the need may be there but politically there are roadblocks can you give some indication of in your previous projects what were the challenges from you know other than technical other than financing other than what just um policy on the ground the public's reception of such a project there were one of the advantages to a project like from a public point of view is that it's not visible so that takes away an awful lot of sort of immediate sort of knee-jerk opposition uh and so we we didn't experience a lot of that there were there was political opposition in new jersey to the hudson project based on the fear that we were somehow exporting new jersey power into new york and thus would leave new jersey short now that wasn't true but it was a it was a fear that was voiced and so there was a certain amount of opposition with that to get kind of the neptune project i don't know any of you are familiar with the uh with jones beach on long island that jones beach was sort of this iconic beach um uh what am i trying to say recreational area that was uh created by robert moses back in the 40s and if you've ever seen jones beach it's really something this cable goes right underneath jones beach and so you can imagine that the agencies that were guardians shall we say of jones beach were concerned about that would there be an impact you know would scare the beach goes away that kind of thing again the answer is no because technically when you bring a cable on shore like that it's like 40 50 feet below and again that can be shown technically so a lot of a lot of a lot of what we dealt with was i guess in the category of education where and this was true of the resource agencies as well it was like what do you mean you're going to you know cut a trench in our river and so uh the the good news is that you can model you can study and model things like sediment transport you know are you creating vast clouds of potentially contaminated sediment that travel you know habitat areas and that kind of things these are questions that we faced not so much from the public but from the agencies not in a hostile way but in a concerned way because they weren't familiar with and you know we fully expect that we will have to answer those and other kinds of questions as we get further into it particularly over the next year next year will be the sort of bulk of the studies and the modeling and the citing and that kind of thing that will uh be you know preliminary to actually filing applications so we're going to get really into them into the weeds and maybe i shouldn't say that but uh really get into the details of how this is going to work going to work some of it we already know the or we think we know the answer but we're just going to have to demonstrate it and some of it we don't know the answer because the uh the uh the territory out there is different so i mean that's sort of how we exci all i can tell you is sort of our approach thank you i appreciate that i especially appreciate you um speaking to us at the beginning um as opposed to you know just at the right time or just when the is now so i appreciate you being here today if i can if i can uh give some credit to your staff on that who suggested that that might be a good idea for that very reason which of course they're obviously yeah they're often right thank you thank you for your question cindy are there other questions or comments or grill this is perry choctoot yes perry um mr hawker does uh electricity dissipate off this cable like it does a regular power grid essentially normal i i i qualified that essentially but part of the part of the concern that we faced before and which we fully expect to uh face again is uh whether the cable actually for instance does it does it generate heat does it generate electric and magnetic as it's in the river and so we have studied that and not only have we studied that but it's been now the subject of of uh a number of studies including for the trans bay cable so the the the short answer is no or that it can be within a just minuscule range where you've got a little temperature change but by the time it reaches the top of the sediment it's gone you know so that has been studied uh and quantified that's crazy i'd like to jump in and even though i'm not a transmission engineer um the difference is this is a direct current cable this is a dc line versus the alternating current or the ac line and so the way that the energy is transmitted to the k through the cable is is a little bit different and with the studies that chris has mentioned these are things that will be brought up and um kind of explained in through the permitting process excellent you don't have the line losses with this kind of uh transmission that you do with ac that's true the reason why i ask is uh this river is very special to native american tribes and when uh bonneville was put down in it inundated a um a gathering area that was one of the largest gathering areas for fish procurement in the entire west and so um we they've established uh rights in the river to harvest these fish and and i'm wondering if a buried cable will affect their migratory process which would in turn affect the ability from the tribes to harvest these uh fish and uh by the way thousands of native americans still uh depend on that migratory fish for uh eating and for their dietary so i just wanted to um ask if if the cable dissipated uh electricity but it sounds like it it's uh minimal being that it's dc rather than ac well i appreciate that yeah there's this no i and and i i can tell you and we can provide it if you want there's there's a specific study on the uh impact of the trans-bay cable in the san francisco bay including on a species of salmon i can't remember whether it was a species that's found in the columbia but it was a species of salmon and um so that was that was heavily studied and the um one of the conclusions was that the existing structures like bridge piers in the water actually had more magnetic fields the cable in other words which was minimal to begin with so again but to the previous question you know this is exactly the kind of question that we have gotten expect to get don't mind answering you know there's been quite a bit of uh studies done since we first for instance uh built the neptune project so there is now pretty decent uh uh and and study a body of studies that has been done that hopefully can help answer these thank you other questions i have a question uh this is marcy grail we often have a member of a labor union come talk about the need for projects done in oregon to use for oregon workers so my question is how what does it look like from a manpower perspective in terms of utilizing how many workers participate on such a project and would you be looking to hire folks locally to to do the work answer to your first question is that excuse me the principal influx of labor need is during the construction period which is a couple of years uh it's probably several hundred jobs involved in building the converter and both of the converter stations would be in oregon there are other jobs required for instance in the horizontal directional drill and even on board the barge that kind of i would say that vast majority of that labor we certainly expect could be sourced locally our experience with the neptune and hudson projects each was under a project labor agreement it's the expectation that you know this one would be under a project labor agreement but during the construction period yeah i would say at least 90 percent would be localized so the the technology and the converter stations and the uh things like joining the cable and that kind of",

        "text": " so you guys know it's not an official change just trying to remember could say promote since maybe the argument is that we're not currently doing that how's that and it might be that that needs to be a second bullet because we want to make sure that we're not raising rates too right so yeah so we'll agree thank you yeah i was going to say this i think those are those are related so those two bullets are related but i would really appreciate that kind of all right so again it's just i think it's the support for this is very strong it's just uh we want to make sure there's no like cost thanks for sharing um ryan has his hand up i know angela's you're on deck with a new thought ryan did you want to talk about this current conversation yeah i just thank you yeah i just wanted it real quick one of the things that i was thinking about when the promote equitable distribution of costs and benefits for all oregonians i think one one thing that we'd kind of talked about a little bit throughout some of these sessions was that those non-participating individuals weren't negatively impacted as well uh so i don't know if it's worth adding some language to that uh something like while not negatively impacting non-adopting or non-participating individuals but i think this goes back to the i guess the the point of equitable distribution of costs and then who is bearing these costs so just some way to kind of capture the voluntary participation trying to think of how to phrase that like throw a bullet at the bottom and we could work on it all right so i still have angel on jack with a new thought is it pure are you back on this conversation we're waiting for another thing sorry i need to lower my hand thank you great all right i think we're ready for angela and then we'll continue the conversation here on the ones that we talked about to make sure everybody's good to go well now i do have a couple thoughts on this last topic first of all it's to me it's a little bit misleading to talk about participants versus non-participants often i mean in something like community solar yes you voluntarily sign up for that you are choosing to participate in something like small scale renewables communities don't have exactly that same type of choice there's you know a lot of the projects that we've heard about there was an opportunity for a particular community that someone was able to take advantage of so that's not as if a rate payer is choosing to participate or not um but all of these projects we've heard about results in benefits not just for those particular ratepayers but really for the entire system so i want to urge us to kind of stay away from that language of participant versus um and the other thing i was thinking about when we were talking about this and james comment about energy burden you know i'm not an expert in this topic and i think it would be great when i appreciate chrissy talking about you know touching back on this issue i think it's really important because the way that you know cost effectiveness and least cost least risk that really doesn't include all the benefits um especially when we're talking about people with higher energy burden so it would be great to me when we revisit this conversation we could have some join us like comment the energy project that really work with low-income rate payers and folks that face higher energy burden i just want to throw out those two things but moving on to my next point um something um jimmy mentioned about small-scale projects not necessarily having more economic development opportunity than larger projects that the big difference there is that small projects can take advantage of particular opportunities that large projects cannot so for example you know i think back to one of the very first projects we heard about with the small scale wind that's a perfect example if that wasn't a small scale project it wouldn't have happened at all and so that is a very unique economic development opportunity that small-scale projects bring that just isn't possible you know there wasn't going to be another large-scale wind project there these small projects can take advantage of very unique circumstances you know in that case leftover wind turbines and other cases you know unique land use opportunities and things like stephanie do you feel like you got that yeah i'm i'm just still trying to figure out verbiage right now and also listen to what they're saying so yeah yeah go go just making sure you have what you needed there yeah yeah so i want to get that down i think ryan's back so hang on ryan um but also james had a comment about worrying that we don't have shared definitions of equitable costs and benefits so i don't want to lose track of that i'm just making sure i say that out loud the other thing is while we might swing back around after our break to touch in on this again this is our last workshop and so we won't be having another workshop to bring experts in to parse out some of this stuff as angela suggested although that would be cool but this is kind of it so um just making sure folks know that that it would be good for us to kind of settle on this and we can also talk about it offline after this too but just wanted to kind of let folks know that and then um i'm getting just so focused now i'm getting whispered from one of my colleagues also to bring something up that might be worth asking you all about um that kind of relates to what james had to say what ryan had to say and ryan you're welcome to to join in on this um and i'll let you answer first and say your piece too but while he's talking maybe folks can consider kind of parsing the issue there's some small scale projects that don't have beyond that small scale project and like the folks that are directly nearby like the example that was whispered to me is like um like improved water quality from a dairy might not be something that electricity rates should cover so maybe that would be state dollars um versus benefits to the grid that would benefit the electricity system so would it be helpful is my question and then i'll go to ryan and then we can get answers to this question would it be helpful to distinguish somehow between benefits to this date and benefits for this for the system and ryan you can go you kind of took the words out of my mouth that's exactly where my mind had gone honestly and angela i completely with you know there's a lot of benefits that are kind of more holistic global and then we've got these local benefits and one of the and this is a struggle that we've had throughout this all of these sessions right we there's all these benefits but how do you determine who bears the cost of those benefits and i think i think christy that was a really good point where my mind was going to is that you've got kind of different sections of you know and we don't need to determine who bears the cost right now it's just that is something that should be noted uh that that i think i i would think everyone can kind of agree on right there's different sets of benefits here and different individuals you know should or could pay for those benefits but there should be some some voluntary nature to that decision of those individuals is just where my mind was kind of going thanks for sharing that right yeah thank maybe we're kind of getting somewhere with this idea that it's appropriate for some small-scale projects to be funded this way and others in a different way hearing the concerns from the utilities the answer is oh yes shifted yeah i was just thank you yeah my brain thank you great and then angela you are you back or is that still an old hand and then i want to note your comment too that not having so clean energy um an energy community energy project is not on the line here as far as they know they wanted she's asked if maybe they could weigh in or just saying it's uncomfortable for her to not have the way in and i'd be like happy to take this to them and provide input back to the whole group if that makes sense that'd be great thank you um and yeah just one more thing with since my hand is up i i feel like we're we're sort of missing the big picture here about how benefits in one area of the state or one community do really have benefits to the entire in so many ways you know health environmental but even just looking at the economic development if you have higher wages in one community because of a new project that means higher income tax revenue for the state which means money can go elsewhere i mean i i feel like we're getting a little siloed here when we talk about how you know the the participants or the community should should um kind of bear the the costs and the rate responsibility um of our project i mean they're they're benefits that we don't currently take into consideration in our methodology rates and and benefits and costs and we're overlooking a lot of the bigger picture i guess great um jimmy has his hand up then james and then nikita yeah so jimmy thanks i was just going to sort of weigh in on this issue of um you know should we be differentiating between those sort of costs and benefits and yeah i mean i think like i think we can all recognize that there are and i think utilities would definitely acknowledge that when we're talking about renewable energy projects there you know benefits associated with those projects that are attributing to the power system um and i think you know in case it was sort of unclear beforehand you know the you know pge's are the viewpoint that yeah it makes sense for you know utility slash customers to pay for those power system benefits that are benefiting the you know the grid and the power system um but i think we do i think it is important to parse out and appreciate the sort of suggestions from others on the call to sort of differentiate the sort of costs and benefits that are you know sort of power system focused versus um you know income tax generating focus to borrow the last example uh you know we could consider like borrowing language that's used sort of frequently in other spaces where like sort of above market costs are you know sort of thought of as being an amount a quantity of costs that sort of go beyond what is sort of you know compensated for and sort of recognized as a direct power system so offer that for if people folks are like looking for language that",

here in awkward silence we'll get that here we got a question so um are projects that integrate existing renewable generation into a micro grid with battery storage eligible for the program yes is the short answer the devil's always in the detail um and so we'd have to take a look at that the um the it would also have to be uh micro grid design specifically to support the resilience and reduce the effects of grid disruption um so as long as that was built into the design and planning of it um what's not allowed is New Generation so um if it's a so a micro grid um where the resilience generation is from solar um the solar aspects of that are not eligible funding but aspects of the micro grid would be great the next question is could you please repeat what is not allowed that you mentioned previously so I don't know if it's easier to just go back to the slide thanks Joshua glad glad we yeah i' like to put up the um the eligible whoops there we are um and what's not allowed is cyber security measures and new generation of of electricity just those two things um can just maybe just leave this up for a sec the other thing that's discouraged but not specifically disallowed is are um maintenance um and that can be a little bit subjective so we'll sort of address that project by project detail by detail um and I want to point out that I got that information from the US Department Energy's um frequently asked questions website or document that's on the federal website link and Emily just included a link to the FAQ in the chat for those of you interested um next question Joshua and Lisa thank you for the question so far this is from Brenda if we have applied for grip in the past with different project Scopes is the letter still required um I believe they still want the letter so they can confirm that the that the Scopes don't apply and they have some background information so they can go look up your your grip application um our directions are anybody who has a grip uh project should give us the letter just so that the US Department of energy can be conflicted great thanks Clay and um if anybody um has joined the call and hasn't yet introduced themselves in the chat please do um I know we had some folks join a little bit late which is great we're so glad you're here and then um Tean has a question if our utility is a subrecipient other under another organization's grip Grant but not the direct applicant or recipient what are the grip letter requirements I would assume still have to put the letter yeah yeah and just making that distinction about what what parts of the project and scope fall under your entity under under your organization um and then again we'll be we'll have a period we'll be able to go back and forth with our project officer at the US Department of energy to get anything like that sorted out if it comes up great and then last for now is Janine uh what is the period of performance for this round of funding they have some concerns about supply chain delays for Su certain equipment right yeah I've heard some national other National chatter about the reclosers and and other equipment in the shortfalls but our period will be in like May April a April 2028 will be the end of the period in any performance agreements we signed to start but there are a few ways to extend projects um beyond that um but for now what we're um going to go with is April of 2028 for the the end of the period and of course the concerns or the things that come up with supply chain would would end up being in most cases a legitimate reason for a no cost extension to a performance agreement from what we're seeing so far great well we'll just sit here until you have more questions for us and if the silence gets to be more than a couple minutes I think we'll move on I suppose yeah and um I'll just say if if if you're thinking about question but don't want to do it now you know please I'll I'll put up my phone number and my email at the end um before we say goodbye um but please email or call anytime and I can set up other technical experts we can have one onone meeting or just answer uh questions by email um that's fine too however you guys want to get in touch just don't hesitate to do so don't wait till the deadline uh I'm available and and uh and ready to take your questions at any time that might have been the couple minutes we haven't had any oh uh let's see we have some more yay it always happens perfect thank you um Janine thank you can you speak to the public engagement expectations for projects okay sure um one of the documents Linked In the um opportunity announcement in the resources section are the um Department of energies and the um grid deployment offices metrics document specifically for this program and in there they have all of the metrics and the measurements that the department of energy is going to be used to assess the projects that get selected we're going to try and use some of that but not as strictly as the department of energy for looking at applications right and so it really is up to the entity but if you go and find that um grid metrics document guidance document it talks specifically about the community engagement and the type and degree of Engagement and so that's really the best guide instead of me talking about it is to go and get that guide and look at that Community engagement but again it's doing the Outreach to your customers and whatever level you're able to allow them to participate in the project um and then keep them informed of the project and then um you know a high degree of Engagement would be allowing your customers or your communities to participate in Project selection um you know so it runs that whole range um I'm going to jump right to Lisa's uh question about the question is um Can the application include equipment Andor off-road vehicles required to support getting the projects done yes I mean that would fall under um see I guess that would you know it would sort of fall under the hardening of facility substations and others um or um prevention systems monitoring control it or utility pole management it could fall under that it's a little bit subjective but our understanding is that type of equipment that allows you to get your grid back in service faster that's reduc reducing the duration of grid disruptions and so increased equipment increased Parts is also um an eligible cost from the the other things that we've read or heard from the Department of energy because anything that reduces your downtime is a grid resilience measure sorry I was talking on mute for a second I'm back off mute um I'm just gonna stay off mute hopefully no weird sounds will happen uh so um John Warner is wondering in PGE territory is PGE the only eligible applicant I think um I guess I mean I yeah I can't imagine the project that you're talking about John so um you know each you know the utility um you know if if they're the transmission utility it's PG territory and it's their distribution Network their customers I would expect a PGE project um I'm not sure if that's getting to your your question utilities are the eligible applicants so yeah I suppose there could be like a world in which like another utility decided to put a project like on the border into PGE territory or something that serves their need because if that's where the land is or something I don't know right yeah if you have a specific idea John you know go ahead and and Emil me email me and and we can research great yeah John will have Clay's um email address at the end and then go to thatan is pointing out the application portal is not open um and asking if there's anything we can expect to be in there that's not currently available and I think the answer to that is you have everything you need and when the portal is open you should be able to just cut and paste things in right is that the that the plan clay exactly it's basically a Dropbox where you'll upload all of the documents um and then there'll be a series of like attestations or certifications that um that you are the authoriz a person authorized to submit the application there'll be a place for an electronic signature it really is just a way for us to have a portal where we can have an auditable deadline and not have any conf conf usion about when the submissions came in or any submissions possibly coming in after the deadline um but it don't need any of the meat or heart of the application is all on those documents that are already posted and available hi so um I'm going to go to Lisa's question because it relates to the portal and then I'll go back to Joshua's question so Lisa is just asking when the portal will open I believe that's as soon as possible but don't have a don't have a set deadline I would like to see it open in May um just to give people time to to sort it out and and take a look um but uh but we don't have a set date yet and generally like our thinking on this we we've had this happen in the past where our portal hasn't been open and that's why we kind of put together everything that you need to complete the application so that because in our experience you need to sort of like draft everything in a separate document to like have everybody review it that needs to review it and all of those things before you just kind of put cut and paste it into the portal in the end so the portal it's there's nothing there that you don't already have and the idea is really just so that we don't have to delay getting the money out the door to you all to do the projects that we know you want to get going as soon as possible because our it folks are not able to get to opening the portal right away so hopefully that makes sense and you agree that it it seems like the right approach to here's everything you need and then in the end the thing you just need to cut and paste to will be open and hopefully that will all um open in time for you to do it but we didn't want to like slow everything down right that's exactly right CH see the only thing is we won't even have any cut and pasting it this",

        "text": " be asking you to do is rank these in those two categories again so ranking all of the physical measures it's across all the threats so we're wanting to understand across these threats which of these measures would you prioritize is most important and then doing the same thing for operational so I'll pop over to the questions real quick just to draw your attention to the number of questions that you're on so it's questions 19 through 22 your 19 and 20 are the physical prioritizing them entering any that we need to know about and then 21 and 22 are focused on the operational the first physical I take in the second part operation so I can leave it on this slide here if you want it for reference and give you a minute to work e e we are running a little over obviously so I'm going you about one more minute to wrap up and then we'll move on to let's move to the Natural Gas sub sector and so now we're looking at the threats of Cascadia physical attacks wildfire and Windstorm and again we have the physical measures on the top operational on the bottom and again some of these are baled these do address specific gaps that we were able to identify based on feedback so just team these up for you you can jump right into the questions 23 through 26 so 23 and 24 for the physical measures 25 and 26 start the e e I'm G to go ahead and just see if liquid fuels you guys are helping I can see you're working hard I really appreciate it I'll just let you roll right into liquid fuels as you're ready so you you know the routine now um physical on the top operational on the bottom for liquid fuels we're focused on Cascadia human cause threats Wildfire wind and winter storms and so for these the questions are going to be 27 through 30 so we'll give you time to wrap up NE gas and liquid fs and we we have a few slides left in the e e e e hey folks we're going to go ahead and move on you can keep working we're just G to wrap up get some final comments so just for our next steps we talked earlier about all our stakeholder engagement efforts so we do have the project roll out that will be our next round of of stakeholder engagement um so we will be taking all of this feedback across all the regions and using your perspectives to inform how this data is is framed and prioritized in the final board and then we'll have a meeting to present that to everybody um we as you're in the middle of FL I know some of you are still working just highlighting questions 31 through 33 again opportunities for you to speak to us um question 31 is specific about your region so I have heard several comments today about the unique characteristics about Portland nro area that many of us are familiar with um please highlight that here if you haven't yet done so in slide to this point let us know any concerns about your region that you feel need to be on our radar or emphasize question 32 any comments or feedback in general um any anything at all that you want us to be aware of and then question 33 what can Odo do um moving forward to better serve your needs then oh this is the very last okay so you're still working on slid I'm just going to talk about another initiative that organ Department energy is working on so we're also developing organ energy strategy and so oo is leading this work we working with bries DEQ business Oregon PC all helping to develop an energy strategy for Oregon which we were just talking about very important trade-off conversation around resilience and so this is going to be very important to developing an energy strategy how can we take a look at the VAR of pathways you know the state in general has robust energy and climate goals so how can we do it how can we get there how can we direct policy technical assistance investment within our state on specific Pathways to meet our goals and so the energy strategy is an opportunity for us to develop a plan of how we can do that and so this won't be a linear plan much as this energy strategy will be an evaluation of the options ahead of us and so it goes back to kind of those tradeoffs of what's what are the opportunities within meeting our goals what are the economic impacts how can we maintain the liability the energy security plan dictates we need to but also what are the economic opportunities or how can we maintain affordability what can we take a look at and so it's exciting we're starting to develop the eny strategy what we're developing is a report that will be do the legisl the govern's office November 2025 so we're just at the beginning of this process so this is an opportunity for me to kind of highlight just as you SE this en the security plan stakeholder involvement impact and feedback it's really important that development and will be for the energy strategy as well and so we've got a webinar com on June 3 that I would strongly encourage people to attend and offer their better offer their thoughts and ideas just as much as the security plan a larger energy strategy how we talk about those tradeoffs when we're talking about undergrounding Alliance we're talking about uh transitioning more electrification what's the future role of fuels within our state we're taking a look at all those things and stakeholder impact from everybody a diverse group experts as well as the general public it's going to be critical to us having a really successful and robust enery strategy and so it's a really big thing I'm trying to cond and say really quickly so I will stick around if people have more specific questions about kind of the development what's coming going forward but I would just highlight please join us in our webinar we are going to be focus on updating people on what's going on with that development as well as saying okay we're gonna start developing work groups listing sessions going around the state through the opportunities to to get involved and uh come so how much is the energy security plan that you're currently working on informing the energy strategy well we'll see we here from stakeholders so I would say quite a bit uh but we'll talk to stakeholders about okay we've got these end goals so let's do some energy modeling what what are the different opportunties within Transportation how does that change everything whe the concern but if we hear from sters they say don't worry about that which I doubt uh then then we that would be uh say model to be less important but I don't think that's I here and does this strategy tie into what I I can't remember now the new name what used to be the organ global commission and and kind of its work it's now it's got a new name now I think or it's yeah but it will be independent of that independent yes so that's why we'll need stakeholders so we'll have other state agencies will be involved in this and providing input uh but there will also be an Advisory Group that stakeholders can join the public to contribute to that as well as we'll do a BRI working groups list sessions the working group will be focus on areas say transmission lines or fuel or something like that and and within those we'll certainly be talking about resilience we'll be talking about affordability be talking about all these different things and how do we evaluate tradeoffs the EIC impacts the health impacts equity and all the other concerns isn't it more halfways to reaching the the ghg goals of the state I mean that's kind of what the state energy plan is I mean as I call yeah right there so that's the end goal and so how how can we get there and how can we maintain resilience or maintain affordability we get there different paths U stray away from that is that something we want to evaluate what are some false reputations do yeah no I a bigger issue that I've been concerned with is just how all of these State programs and policies find their alignment you know in the long-term 2035 2050 vision of where we want to get to just making sure they're not invol you know parallel universes of effort but they're not TI together with goals that get us where we want to go I would say one that's why we do get us all kind going in one direction or coming to some kind of consensus General general direction it's not going to be one linear path because things are going to change but I also highlight just like the energy security plan it's be iterative process this is a one one shot deal we have to do this a couple times and get updated as technology advances as state change so we'll have to evolve that but the general idea is it's all going the same direction policy wise add to your point ATO we talk about all these projects and all the work that has Ong going every day with the office issues um but the fact that we have multiple ongoing projects that have um you know different staff working on them and even different divisions um is recognize um I think we recognize both the here today set an example that we're coordinating the best we can our prti is going first the security plan is coming first in time it's good because that provides us with um you know a great to you knowledge that we gain information St all the things we're doing here to help Michael and his team on strategy and for what they what they're doing their Contra do I will say that you know we're all by ban at the top directly so she takes ke just making sure that to app all the work we have on going SP is coordinated um I think that's it great thank you so much know something a little different than just one thanks everybody online for bearing with us

        "text": " peak transmission needs and so there's some other pretty major co-benefits that you know may have decade-long benefits and billion-dollar sort of avoided costs associated with them that i think would be you know worth considering incorporation and some of this modeling so anyways i'll pause there and happy to ask answer any questions or you know sync up with folks in the future but i think there's some some big pieces there that again just continually having become aware of this this group uh hopefully fit in somewhere in this yeah thank you jake uh glad you found us and uh we did uh have a focused conversation around transmission needs storage needs associated with one of our recommendations in our 2020 report to the legislature which was the 100 percent clean electric sector um recommendations so uh we did follow up with some deep dives certainly i think would be beneficial to um to circle back to that uh as we start to look at how we implement these these programs and and understand a little more about what the utilities are proposing so thank you linda i have lost my there we go maybe i've got it back okay so next up is catherine thompson catherine thompson excellent so we do have a few more people that have signed up looks like we have five or six so please keep your comments to three minutes or under catherine you're unmuted thank you can you hear me all right i'll speak up um my name is dr catherine thomason i'm speaking as the co-chair of the multnomah county democrats climate action team first i want to thank you for your outstanding efforts to explain the modeling and some of the caveats listed at the introduction of this presentation and thank you as well for moving this forward to guide the state i'm hopeful it will be heated we are thrilled that you are shooting to model for improved targeting by 2030. initial actions will tend to be the most and cost effective so targeting achievement of those early on is very both to reduce the threat of climate change and to reduce the high cost of impacts from extreme weather and health i would like to caution on two major issues the first is not to rely as much in the programs especially for the accelerated 2030 goal with emphasis on alternative liquid and gaseous fuels that have a wide variation in the literature in modeling their true greenhouse gas emissions for example we believe that corn ethanol is significantly worse than gasoline in greenhouse gas emissions along with other non-quantified societal problems of nitrogen pollution and food in the case of rng the true evaluation of methane leaks which occur whether the gas is bio or fossil is not adequately included in many analyses i'd urge you in these cases to ramp up as quickly as possible the electrification of transportation and buildings and to advocate for legislative actions that would achieve these rather than agency-only tools i think that's very very important because of the pushback that we're seeing from major industry and the fuels industries as well lastly bringing forth the concept that methane gas heat pumps are not readily available whereas electric heat pumps are and they're well studied especially assuming your high market penetration by 2030 it may also be useful to bring forth new frameworks for fossil fuel industries such as the encouraging methane gas industry to become a thermal industry that's being piloted in where they are building neighborhood ground sourced heat pumps owned and run by the thermal industry with connections to each home this type of thinking is important for industry success and jobs creation instead of advocating for hybrid sources which as you've shown have lower net cost benefits thank you so much for allowing public comment thank you catherine really appreciate your your ongoing uh interest in our work and comments welcome karen uh can you hear me we can welcome okay um i actually didn't raise my hand but since you called on me um i i am a member of climate reality portland and uh co-chair of the legislative committee and so we our focus is on oregon legislation that will really ramp up the speed and scale of oregon going all electric because that's how we feel like we're going to make our we're particularly interested at the moment on the infrastructure reduction act and um really encouraged by that act and that that will get our nation to 40 reduction in um emissions by 2030 um which i'm thrilled to see that this commission is also looking at 2030 and that you will match up with that group but i think to get us there we have to look at all electric and that the hybrid isn't isn't going to get us there and um that's how we um how we are looking at it and we hope you'll give that and um thanks for all of the work that you're doing and i think you're going to really help us get to that last 10 percent i think oregon will be a key a key player there excellent thank you karen tim miller welcome tim very good thank you chair mcdonald and members of the commission and uh big thanks to alan and odo and the analyst team for this really great information super helpful to be able to understand these investments and their yield and looking at those curves over time um i i want to just applaud uh what alan covered about really digging into the valuation of the i thought there was a strong list there of some of the economic considerations around co-benefits and i'm speaking sorry i should have introduced myself i'm the executive director of peci and we're a funder of climate policy uh work but i'm speaking also with the experience of having run and habit which was an organization that helped some 5000 organ families do deep energy retrofits on their homes so i just want to double down on the the comments about the importance of valuing health risks and other those kinds of considerations burning gas in a house you know the dramatically increased risk of uh kids getting asthma in addition to you know missing school days and parents missing work days and all the other cascading effects of the health impacts and i know it's going to be hard to value those but i really encourage attaching some pretty strong dollar figures to those effects and then there are also things like air sealing and other measures that would go along with doing these residential retrofits that have their own indoor air quality benefits and other benefits and as as angus mentioned the value of air conditioning let's figure out how to value that when you're at least if you're adding a heat pump to a house so i would go as far to say you know quantifying these various benefits um and reorganizing then the mac curve that alan was instructing us on is to me super important even so much as to say i i don't think it's fair to call the the straight up sort of myopic how much dollars do i put into this system and how many dollars do i save uh in my utility bills i don't think it's fair to call that an economic analysis i think we should change our and we have obviously in this state a history of i'd say misusing the term cost effective we should call it narrow cost effectiveness or narrow economic analysis or a narrow financial analysis it's not a full analysis if you're just looking at those things um and i can say that the of the 5 000 families that upgraded their homes years ago under under the program i mentioned um i think very few of them made those decisions based on just dollars and cents i make decisions on a whole lot of other factors and let's let's try to get all those economic considerations in there and then recognize that there are non-economic co-benefits like it's really hard to measure the value of a kid missing a school day or getting asthma or whatever those things those are those should be the icing on top but let's put dollars behind all those other trade-offs thanks thank you really appreciate your karen it looks like nick is next nick um nick did you want to say anything more it looks like we got your question answered i went ahead and unmuted you if you want get any thanks so much for the data okay i think that's it then catherine okay excellent thank you with that we can move on to our kind of additional discussion that we had and it might make sense for someone to pull up the slide deck maybe maybe alan and then we can revert to that as we need to but just interested in reactions to what you all heard today on any of the comments that we heard from the public suggestions about how we move forward any any of that would be very welcome uh this is tom i just had a quick uh comment on on some of the public comments uh especially the one that that two people i believe you know we should not look at hybrid type models that really concentrate just on electrification and i'd like to just in a sense respond to that a little bit in that you know looking at the hybrid alternative fuel forces i don't think that slows anything down or or changes the picture but i think it it's more robust that we look at these things as time goes on technology is going to change too uh and and so i i just think keeping those other options available to doesn't necessarily mean we will miss the 2030 possible target but it allows us to have that richness and then as we go down the road these things may become more viable more economically viable alternatives for us to use to reduce emissions so i i think we we're i think it's good we have a hybrid look and i think we shouldn't lose sight of that thank you thank you commissioner patowski other comments this is tom riekman and i had a comment or yeah based on uh like what tim miller was saying uh we need maybe we need to move retro fitting up i mean there's i guess i need some clarification i mean i i assume we're not going to put a heat pump in a home that doesn't have insulation because all we'll do is raise the cost utility cost which would be an equity issue it would affect low-income people to a higher degree so i guess yeah just some clarification on where we are on alan or chris do you want to oh you've gone on mute somehow you put yourself on mute commissioner raymond is the question would we put a heat pump in a in a house that wasn't uninsulated i think that he's hoping to understand how we're thinking about retrofitting i think it's based on the discussion that we had around the cost curve right",

        "text": " seems to me why couldn't the Roberts estates sell the property and donate that $3 million and let you guys go find another piece of property that's maybe 50 acres, something that's more manageable to take care of and suit all the needs for the dog hound and the animal rescue. All right. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Jerry Stanton. Jerry, you want to come on up? Janet? My name is Janet Ray. I live at 250 West Highway 316. My property is about a quarter of a mile from this facility. I consider this a NIMbY project and not in my backyard. And I'm sure that none of you on the board would want this facility when 500 yards or a mile away from your property. And if you do, there are several properties, nice properties, located adjacent to this that are going on the market this week. I'm also sure the donor family, the Roberts clan, does not want this facility anywhere near the yalapony, the Golden Ocala Golf course, or their estate at 225 a in Germantown Road. Even though said property is of adequate size to accommodate this facility and is also zoning agricultural. So this property will be, this facility will be dumped in our community, affecting our quality of life and devaluing our properties. And you do vote for it, go call with the breath and sigh of relief that it will not be in your backyard. Thank you. Thank you. Luke Smith. Luke my name is Jerry Staten, address 1200 West Highway 316. Citra. My wife and I live on a 72 acre farm immediately across from the subject farm. The front of our farm is approximately 900ft. It's separated only from the subject farm by the road easement of three of County Road 316. The entrance to our farm is approximately 100ft west of the subject farms entrance. Most of my concerns have already been addressed. I do not think the proposed development comes anywhere close to meeting the objective of the farmland preservation area. It certainly is not compatible with the neighborhood up there, and we are strongly opposed to the development of this project. Thank you. Thank you. Peggy Goldberg. Peggy? Hello. My name is Luke Smith, and I live at 1165 Northwest 155th street. It says Jt Smith. That's my uncle. I inherited this property from my father. He passed away this past April. He was the owner, and I currently am now of Ellery Smith Ben's painting. We've been in business for 45 years. This is my livelihood. That's more money out of my pocket. Another farm owner? Not no. Cala. When you turn on 316 off old Jacksonville, there's a nice little sign there that says farm preservation area. From there all the way to Williston, it says farm preservation area. Now, when you turn on that road, if you all could just do me a favor one day, go out there, get you cup of coffee from the store, and just take a drive through there and just see how beautiful it is. You don't have to stare at any large buildings. You don't have to pass a bunch of cars. I can drive from 316 to Williston and maybe count on both hands how many cars I pass. Sometimes one, you know, and it's. I have a two year old son, and me and my wife, we lived together in that house, and, you know, one person had raised it. You know, people don't work these things for free. And a lot of them are volunteers or inmates that work county properties, and they're not nice people. And I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want an inmate if you have a young son or a young daughter, I wouldn't want an inmate that's possibly been arrested for child crimes before or after or whenever, for them to be in and around your property, you know, and then, you know, that's just the noise and everything. We don't want. Of course, no one wants to listen to that, you know, and I understand that. But at what point, you know, do we start making, you know, that this is a farmland, this is for farms, this is for horses, this isn't for dogs, this isn't for cats. It's farmland preservation. From start to finish. That's it. Farmland. Every farm has maybe three or four dogs, a couple barn cats, but there's no need for three or 400 dogs on one of the most beautiful horse farms in Ocala. That's like taking Bridlewood and sticking a freaking dog pound on it, you know, it's like living next to a prison. I don't think any of you want to live next to a prison. You know, they're not going to have that three board fence around there anymore. It's going to be a wired fence, you know, with probably a wire on top. And we all have to stare at that every day. I just, you know, if you guys could please take into consideration that this doesn't happen. Sorry, my voice is shaking. I've never done this before, but appreciate you guys time. Thank you. Fred Crusoe. Fred. Okay, Peggy. Hey, my name is Peggy Goldberg, and I live at 1501 Northwest fifth Street, which is directly behind Stan and Kitty's farm. We have lived there for 41 years, and we raised Arabians and miniature Zebu cattle. And believe me, when Stan and Kitty were on that farm, they had some hunting dogs go over just to the left there. And it's right behind up there? No, next door. Keep going left, right there. Anyway, they had hunting dogs in a kennel there that parked all night long. And trust me, you could hear. We couldn't sleep with the windows open. And it's a problem. And to think that you're not going to be able to hear in the country, sound travels so far. And the other issues that everybody has been addressing is we're worried about our water and what it's going to do to our water. And with the waste treatment plants, we're objecting to the smells, the odors, the noise and things like that, and also lights. We cherish our dark skies, and we have astronomy, star club meetings, star parties out there, and that's going to no longer be. And if we try to sell our farm, I'm sure that we're not going to get what we deserve on it. Like I said, we've been there 41 years. Let's see. I'm trying to think. I don't want to talk over what everybody else has talked about because we're also worried about the crime rate. And I have a suggestion. Why can't they find a facility that's more central in Marion county? We're way up in the north end of the county. What about people down in the Bellevue area in southern Marion county? For us going to the facility now, it's too far for us to just drive down there to look at dogs or whatever. It's a long drive. It's going to be the same thing for people coming up. Find a centralized area and again, we don't object to the horses and cattle, because that's, you know, that's what we live, you know, and it will change everything. It will negatively impact our lives in a huge way. And we beg you to reconsider this special use permit. Thank you. Elizabeth Fowler. Okay. Fran? Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. My name is Freddy. So I live four minutes away, walking from the. Where they're going to put the kennels. My wife and I are new to the neighborhood. We bought, like, six months ago to retire. Address, sir? 820 West Highway. 360 Citra. I'm sorry about the accident, and I'm a little bit nervous. This is the first time that I do this. I am going to sell my house. You know, I'm fixing it. I thought that it. It would be beautiful. My wife and I, we saw it, and we fell in love with it. We fell in love with everything. It's a place where you want to, you know, just die, you know, retire and die. My wife and I, we sit down on the front of the house to have a glass of wine and wait for the sunset. We do this every day. I don't think we're going to be able to do it when my neighbors are going to be 400 dogs barking. You know, it's not nice for my wife and I. Probably we can move on, but I know you're trying to save the dogs, or these people are trying to save the dogs and this and that, but at the same time, please think about the community. You're killing all these people. I don't have the right to, because I just moved in, but there's three generations. My neighbor's three generations there. He cries. He couldn't be here. He cries all the time. I mean, think about the community. Think about the neighbors. Think about them. You know, it's not all about the dogs. You know, I don't have anything else to say. You know, I hope that you do the right thing, and for a minute, I think the best thing for you to do is put yourself here. Where I'm at right now. I'm a high school graduate. I didn't go to college, but I've worked hard all my life since I was nine years old, sir. What I have is hard with my hands. It's honest. It's honest. And now my property value is going to go down, and I know where it is because I'm a realtor down south, probably, it's going to go down for 30, 25%. Who the heck is going to buy a house when in front I have a kennel stock pound,",

        "text": " new construction for semiconductors and new businesses that are overtaking my land and yet I feel kind of odd that North Plains is fighting for their survival when they're surrounded by a city like Hillsboro Hillsboro is Gob gobbling up land left and right and it just seems to be just continuing and yet North Plains cannot be controlling their own destiny and I think that's kind of sad so I am for it I think that they need to be able to do what they should do to survive in a an area that's growing like crazy and I think the people behind me that have been leading this charge they've obeyed all the laws they've done everything that they've needed to do even though many are against it a lot are for it but it's because they've done what they've needed to do to to survive so I feel personally that North Plains should have the opportunity to control their own destiny and to provide services and housing for people that want to live in a city that I've been proud to say that I'm in even though I'm not quite in the the the line of North Plains I tell everyone I'm from North Plains and I'm proud of that so I feel that they should um be able to take this charge and to uh provide again services and housing to people not only that live there now but also people that want to live there and I think they'll do a very um a great job at doing it the proper way thank you I guess I guess you haven't come to Banks to Jim's Market we have a great Market it's only four miles away and a liquor store woohoo come on down and V us visit us in Banks anytime my name is Aya hofler I'm a PCP in District 301 Banks Oregon and I'm here today to address you thank you madam chair Lockwood and Commissioners for seeing us in person this has been so long awaited and so so needed to have you back here with us the Synergy of humans being in a room together is amazing and thank you for all your great questions and your patience with us so leaving that aside um I want to say that first of all we have a homeless emergency critical situation in this County of Washington but it's caused by government you need to remember that the state is 70% owned by the government 30% is to the rest of us 20 of that 30% is owned by the big boys that have Timber that leaves 10% to the General Public which probably over 50% is already developed so we're talking about fighting over 5% of the land left in this state for humans to try and continue to live where they were raised I'm a fourth generation logger farmer family out of mountaindale I've lived up here for 50 years I've worked with the Planning Commission in North plains in 1990s uh learned a lot from the attorney there I do land use Consulting work for the little guy uh we have to have affordable housing in North plains there's no obvious guarantee for that it's really bad we do not need need to change the voter uh status of North Plains by having a bunch of rich people uh come out of Portland that hav a clue what goes on in our environment and that food chart you saw is so wrong we raise food for our cattle our livestock our our people you don't worry about the food on the shelf and Safeway you better worry about whether we have Farmers left to provide us food for our people okay we have a real problem here you want to talk about sustainability of food you better take care of your farmers and you need to do an acute Deep dive into looking at what Farmland you really have and you have the false uh Graphics showing this big green area oh this is all agricultural well 7 70% of that green area is Timber you're not going to see a tractor farming and tilling on those hillsides you do not have all that as Farmland so that is one false narrative the other one is they charted in their in their notes oh they're only growing flowers in the fields along Sunset Highway we're not disturbing anything important are you kidding me they're just trying to wash over the importance of our class one so oils that are the best in the world are livestock and you were right Madame chair those lines you saw those are water we have some of the most beautiful wetlands in the area okay and they need to stay that way for our live our livelihood and I'm also going to say that you know the Planning Commission is everybody I believe on the commission lives in the ugb so we're we're run you're running out of time okay okay so I guess my the main thing I want to walk away saying is that we don't need more condos and people and cars and North Plains okay and we need to have some recommendations like you need to give a thousand foot notice in rural areas when you're doing a ugb change you need to do a hydraulic study I'm sorry I okay we don't have water you can write to us I will we don't have water in western Washington County you need to look into that okay it's just this this is a cart before the horse please vote no and give us more time to do a correct study thank you thank you Aya next we have Dale feek and Greg mechum please go ahead for up to three minutes after Greg or Dale and Greg we have Alan cine and Karen schmidlin thank you who's first Dale please go ahead to you thank you Dale yeah go ahead my name is Greg meum my family and I operate 280 Acres I'm sorry to interrupt I should have stated we ask everyone to start with their full name and um address okay thank you let me ask you also do you have this okay my name is Greg mum and I live at 12995 Northwest Bishop outside of North Plains Hillsboro Oregon my and I operate 280 Acres of forest land and farmland um and I've lived in western Washington County for more than 50 years and uh I'm here to tell you that why excessive expansion of the North Plains Urban growth boundary is a terrible idea it allows rapid growth of suburbs and it drives another stake in the heart of agricultureal in this County it creates spective prices young people can't afford land creates unsafe transportation for farm machinery it creates housing that's unaffordable for agricultural workers and it's off public transit there shouldn't be one unit of housing built in North plains that is not multif family housing and here's the reason why if you look at this map everything in red and orange is class one and class two Farmland North Plains EX exists because it sits in the belt of the very best Farmland in twon Valley and probably the wamt valley of Oregon that belt starts at the helva interchange with the Sunset Highway and extends to Duram Road along the sunset there is no other land in Washington County that equals the quality of this soil in this belt North Plains should not expand in any direction out over this land land without very good reasons why the idea that they're going to create some Community with parks and stores out over this land is a travesty and if you look at the uh second page on this map the red and the or excuse me the blue and the green lands are those that exceed 10 to 20% of class one soils you see the larger block of much of the a land in washingon county in yellow and it it's less than 5% you cannot find this land anywhere else the only other two blocks of this size are under Ronler Acres and the City of Sherwood if you take this land to expand to create another commuter suburb it is just a disaster for farming in in Washington County and it is a huge mistake thank you you thank you for your testimony um I'll advise the audience not to make demonstrations please go ahead chair Lockwood and Commissioners I'm Dale fek I've lived in Washington County since 1966 I started as a fifth grade teacher in Forest Grove uh I've enjoyed that i' my address in Forest Grove is on record I particularly don't like to tell it everybody in the community where I live but I live in Forest Grove but you have it on record I gave you I wanted to give you two documents and I sent them through the planning Comm and through Todd and and I think you got them iend had to change it because I was told that you couldn't do it with active links and attachments so I just copied them all and you got a great big longed email from me one thing you couldn't get from me is this document that I handed to you tonight and it has a document be well the reason for that is my understanding that the North Plains development staff used a consultant from Hillsboro and during that time they talked about how they're going to the economic development I think was based upon Echo Northwest uh studies at least it was for Intel and was paid for by Intel Intel did the study but it's paid by Intel and the problem with that was it was only an economic study and I asked the person that actually did the study before they made a presentation I said why didn't they do a cost benefit analysis they said well because Intel didn't ask us to they only ask us to do an economic study and I similar that I assume that's similar to what's been done in North plains economic only not cost benefit and so what this is and I hope to be able to give to you a document that you can open it up because in that it challenges this whole idea of just Economic Development economic DS the US Chamber of Commerce us Chamber of Commerce has sued in essence because they thought carbon was okay carbon's good for the environment they sued in using that argument so the US chamber of commment a lot of little Chambers don't belong to the US Chamber of Commerce but Hillsboro does and so you got to be careful when you talk about people this the recommend chamber of commer now in this document it says the myth of smart growth because I noticed down here somebody said smart growth take a look at what this document says if you get to it in links about smart growth uh more expensive is more expensive how spraw infrastructure bankrupts organ communities so please look at those eight documents there when you get them it can open the link one of the things they presented is Data Centers Mike Ray's done excellent work on",

        "text": " the assumption that all of the infill land that the owners want to sell that want to infill and want to add to those uh you know to the rental housing market uh that mayor batty alluded to before um I'll just close off with saying I'm ready to sign on to a letter um if uh you know of support on behalf of Sherwood all right can I say something why this map is up I'm so sorry to to bust chair but like I just want to make sure that Metro and particularly the Metro counselors because I've had multiple conversations with them around measure 5 and 50 and it was clear to me there is a gap of understanding on how cities collect property tax recue there is a gigantic money difference between industrial land and commercial land and if that land is not going industrial it is really robbing the west side of wealth that we are creating and so I understand that's not part of your analysis here but the revenue that industrial lands bring in I mean and if you look at Beaverton and a couple of the SM small blue dots we would never Zone that Industrial in the middle of a community now but we're going to hold on to it with a death grip because it is the most prized money that we could collect and that's the wrong way for cities to think about this for the long run but that's the cards we're d no I totally agree with you I I see more hands up we running out of time but we'll get to them the other the other question for me is the vast difference in wages in industrial Land versus you know a retail Mall you know if you have Comm if you have a commercial retail Center you know those jobs are going to be you know a little bit above minimum wage but when you have an industrial center you've got you know traded skills higher wages and that's what we want to attract and build in the region versus more fast food restaurants and Retail but with that's only my opinion going to uh councelor Rosenthal has his hand up and then mayor delin thank you mayor bik yeah first of all I I want to thank mayor batty for her support for the Sherwood proposal uh and I just want to say a couple things one first of all we all understand that we have to go through this ug process every so often it's required by the state law so staff has done a lot of work to try and expand the capacity or expand the understanding of what we're trying to accomplish you and I'll give them a a credit for that they've done a lot of work secondly I think uh it's important to recognize that one of the reasons why I support this is because it's creating a potential industrial lands along the area where we've had the biggest growth and that's whether it's a Cooper Mountain the River Terrace One River Terrace 2 or Kingston Terrace I think all these areas are are lands that we're going to have people living in in mixed kind of housing some some Workforce housing some a little some higher and this will provide at least some potential for jobs in that Westside area which I think both improves the property values as well as provides opportunity for people without having to communic commute across the entire area so I think it's a it's a wellth thought out proposal and the other thing that really complicates things this year is of course as we understand that the population projections because because of some issues with Portland and various and the Lo and the regional economy we are not projecting the rapid growth rate from the region that would that would say that we absolutely have to keep adding ugb land where we have Urban reserves that that question was somewhat in doubt because of the sort of the the flatter projections this year so it's important to it's been important to delve into this a little bit more deeply not all the members of the council support this Sherwood expansion and but I am one that does and the president Peterson also does so I appreciate the support from the mayors of the Washington County coordinating commission M Lane hey long as we got the map up could you uh toggle back to where it actually shows a little bit of land in Cornelius go backwards yeah yeah that's not real that's not right but that's part of a larger problem because I was just Google and Google even drags behind apparently apparently Google's in front of the Metro Maps because most of that Northern land in Cornelius has been developed or land banked so it's no longer available so just just kind of a heads up there's a giant building yeah we took we uh we took all of this vacant land Capacity Analysis to staff at each of the cities and asked for their confirmation of um our locations for this um developable land so I I now that I've lodged my protest against the accuracy of the map um I wonder Erin can you help me understand how you guys calculate time in it because you you have this inventory of redevelop land but I've looked in my own community and I've looked across the different spots in the region and the time scale can be horrendously long before the land ever becomes redeveloped I'm seeing so I'm I'm wondering what time scale are you guys using is it just oh it's it could be forever and if it's in Forever then we count it in the 20 Horizon our Horizon is 20 years so we have to have a um I mean and this is capacity so do we believe that this capacity could be used in the next 20 years the demand analysis asks you to say how much of that will actually occur how much demand will be needed over the next 20 years um to grow into these various types of spaces and that's determined by an economic analysis of um a forecast of job growth in different Industries and then Translating that as I showed on that that um all those steps on that slide translating it into a land need so there's no question that when you estimate what might happen over 20 years that you might get it wrong and that's why we present it as a Baseline and then a high and low when it comes to that um that growth for 20 years because it is a you know economists work on this and they have really good um track record of making good choices but they're not going to see the up and ups and downs of the market that happen on a five or 10 year scale well not even five two five year year scale you know um so that's where the policy makers come in where you um you and Leadership and elected officials um weigh in on those ranges to determine what you think is likely so I I'll while I get the floor one more minute here I'll say uh I'm in support of the Sherwood I wish Cornelius could have brought in 500 Acres on the North side because we have the same problem that everybody's talking about um 6,000 people we only have 14,000 but 6,000 of them leave town every day to go somewhere else for employment with an average commute of 29 minutes so that means they're going a lot a lot further than Hillsboro for most of the jobs so I'm full support of Sherwood good for you guys um maybe someday we can get our 500 acres north of town because it's uh the stuff we've got now is developed um so thank you thanks for the analysis and the last comment here then it sounds like the question of whether we're going to support the letter is already done it sounds like we all support letter I saw commissioner F had her R up it went down commissioner F do you wanted to say something uh thank you chair I was gonna Express support for Sherwood as well and and also as well metros analysis because it illustrates the lack of development ready large industrial sites that we have around the region and and also just to plug in um Place matters in urban growth boundary expansion requests Sherwood has demonstrated development Readiness and that they are part of an area with growing Industrial Development so um I'm in support and if we go forward with a letter route um we'll be supportive of that as well from the board great thank you so can we go ahead and take the map down and I think it's a forgo conclusion that we're going to direct uh staff to draft a letter to the Metro Council and support of Metro of Sherwood's employment lands ask um so I'll go ahead and uh just ask for show a hands those folks who are in favor of Staff drafting a letter for us to sign and send the Metro all right see anyone I I'll say I it I'm off camera for now right and I think some of me mayor Batty's points should be placed in that letter they were terrific points you got what you need Stephen on one we do thank you all right well thank you Erin uh and U for your presentation on that we're now going to move on a little bit of behind uh for a presentation from Trevor slan from ODOT some of you might have seen this this is odot's presentation of what they're looking forward uh at in the binoculars for the 2025 session their needs and questions on how to uh fund those needs going for going further to fund all the programs that they need to get accomplished that we want to have to accomplished and work with the legisl the legislature in 2025 um with that uh I believe we have Trevor so is yours I'm here thank thank you for the uh introduction that covers a lot of what I was gonna say on this first slide here so appreciate it Mr chair uh members of the committee thanks for having me here today my name is Trevor sleman I am the uh strategic initiatives adviser at ODOT region one in Portland I've been on the job for uh about two months so I will run through the presentation but may not be the best suited person to address any questions but we'll see um and um the mayor is absolutely correct you may have seen this uh presentation already um in in other forums and so you know you may have the urge to multitask your way through the next 20 minutes and that's fine uh but before you go into your inbox I would just leave you with one thought and that is to just take note of the fact that you have seen this in multiple forums before um we are trying really hard to be disciplined and clear and consistent about the structural Revenue challenges we're facing at ODOT and um and",

And that just happened in our legislative day in Tallahassee. He's talking about the priority list and commission. You remember last how much we try to move those projects up on the priority list? But like commission Curry said, every entity, every agency, they have their priorities. And sometimes ##y Tyler did say as long as he sees they see movement of our priorities, even if it doesn't jump from 10th to second or third. But at least if it's moving up on the priority list, and we had. That's something I was gonna get into this afternoon. Maybe you can, but I've got that canvassing board meeting three o'clockorrow tomorrow, not today. Okay. So I'm not o at the TPO? TPO, yeah. Y'all gonna be at the TPO? You gonna be there? We're gonna need everybody. You need us there? Sure. If you need me, sir. I'll be there. So as it relates in my discussions with Rob, is it relates to RTIP and prioritizing. And they look at priorities inside that five year window and outside that five year window. And of course, my answer is always, our highest priority is that with, which is on that five year tip that we have programmed t that RTIP does not contemplate the funded and unfunded structure as it does in the LRTP. So there may be priority lists happening past that five years. And that's one thing that we constantly cycle back and forth with, is reiterating that a county priority, if it's on that, if it's on our tip, it's priority. And it's a high priority. I know, but the state does not look at our test. They look at the TPO priority local. So that's what Rob uses RTIP to work, to work and build his priority list from. So I'm just thinking out of the box for just a minute. But you know, do we need a liaison from the commission on projects, road projects? We have one on a lot of things. And just to have a point person that is constantly work in our projects with Rob, with Dot, with staff that we don't get lost of by the time it comes in the tip with TPO, we need somebody who is really understanding all of our projects and able to make a case. I'm just throwing it out on the TPO. Yeah, but I think commission Stone, you are looking at a board member to be a liaison to the tip that will work with me, with Alton, with Tracy, with Dot coordination all the time. That's exactly what I'm saying. I am sorry that it needs to be that, but it probably does. Just to give it the emphasis that we need. And especially getting to the TPO meeting to have the conversation with the rest of the municipalities. And it's not always going to be easy getting back to your point. They've got priorities too. But you. We are the largest entity with the most projects that move everybody in this community. Something to think about, mister chair for theisionioning discussion, for the visioning discussion. Okay. So thank you for that. I'll volunteer if that be the case. I mean, if that's your angst, talk about it the next. Yes, sir. All right, so some recent projects, our phase I B project, the northwest 49th street corridor, that is the pit project. You know how that's worked the last couple of last year? We've put it out to bid. Put it out to bid twice. And it's under contract. It's got an NTP and they're moving, moving forward with it. And we are in a value engineering process now trying to see if there's a way to potentially shift that alignment, make a land agreement that might work to our advantage to reduce some of those costs. And at the intersection of US 27 and Northwest 70th Avenue, the corridor there north of WEC, that intersection is nearing completion. Look to have it closed out in May, substantially complete. That is looking really nice, sir. Very good. Yes, thank you. From last week on, it really looks great. Working well. Very good. Very good. So the next intersection will be 40th, I mean State Road 40 and 80, 80th. That will be the next one that goes out. And there we're working through some real estate. We're doing some redesign associated with that particular one. We made some changes. We'already bought all the right of way on that. We've got some drainage work we're doing on that was affected by a large acquisition on the south and west, west corner of that location. Alton, do you know when that is going out the bed? I'll have to get that structure for you. I don't have it off top of my head. Kind of looking at some of our quadrants and what are some highlights and some, some things to look in all four corners. Our Emerald road extension happening in the southeast, looking for that to take some pressure off of Meriamp that road is a challenge, particularly to the east of baseline. And we just recently entered into our agreement with FDOT and in design, we're past 60% in design now and looking to have those construction expenditures made in fiscal year 24. But that's one that we are Reg, you're regularly seeing right away acquisition for that particular effort. One area in the southwest quadrant is a segment of southwest 49th. That's segment f, that is south of that ties Marion Oaks Manor north into the terminus of the existing road. So that'll get traffic moving north along the 49th Avenue corridor quicker. Likely take some pressure off of 484, which is one of our arterials in that segment between the McGinley property and I 75 is increasingly compressed or has an increasing traffic issue. But the road, you can see road det deterior occurring on it. We do have some programmed improvements for rehab, but any pressure off of it is positively in the northeast quadrant, the Northeast 35th street corridor. That's a long term county priority. We don't have construction program, but we, we are acquiring right away. You consistently are seeing parcels coming in and properties coming in for that particular project from 200 a over to 36th Avenue and the northwest quadrant. In the northwest quadrant, we are in design from 40 north to us 27 right now, looking to bring. Finish those design plans in December of 23 and look into bid early in 24. So that's gonna be adding twones of two lanes of. To an existing roadway, the 80th Avenue corridor, with some alignment modifications for ease of construction. Look to expend somewhere in the $23 million range in construction alone on that project, mister chair. So, Eldon, the conversation with the state on 80th and 70th, for it to become a state road, for them to take that project that's still in the works. Any thing to share on that? So I don't have anything to share on it past a discussion. That was some time ago, commissioner. The last conversation that was had was actually when Commissioner Curry and I visited secretary Purdue's office and secretary Tyler was present, and it was just not a. Not one of their priorities. And they had commented about how it was prioritized on the lop, the tpos list. So I don't have an update further on that, but I do understand maybe that we will continue to be speaking with Representative McLean and some contacts that he has. And from my end, the only update that I've got is in speaking with our tpO, we've given them a summation of costs from. From Bucky's all the way down to 200 of how much it'cost to do as a full scale project. But he's asked for it, TPO asked for it to potentially be broken down into the phases, which we can easily provide that information for them. So I don't know if they're looking to do partial prioritizations or how that would work, but that's the last interaction I had with TPL on that particular. And as we talk to TPO and as we get to the TPO list for approval on those segments, we need to see those segments move up on our list of priorities. Understood. Based on the secretary Tyler conversation, commissioner, on the transfer of jurisdiction, we don't have any issues with it. I don't know where it's. Because it. It keeps getting talked about, but then nothing happened. I don't know exactly where DoT is on that issue, and if they want to, if they are interested in taking that road over or not, I think I would like for us to make it clear to DT that we are willing to work with them however they see fit, if they wanted to fund the project and do it. So does that look like a letter from the chair or does it come from the TPO? No, it doesn't have to come from the TK. Well, you say if they want to fund the project, they don't have any money. I mean, the question keeps coming up. I don't want them to think, I don't want anybody to think that we are holding ono the road. We don't want to transfer jurisdiction to the, and that's what's delay in funding about 70th. We talk about 80th Avenue from the whole Westport all the way up to the new, to the 49th street enterchange. If the state wants it and they want to fund it and do that project, we have no issues with it from our end. Well, it would certainly free up additional funds for us to take on other projects if they took it,",

        "text": " whatever utility is your provider for their efficiency um that are available um and then there's information about those and coming Federal stuff all on our the bigger Oregon Department of energy website we've got a lot of links on on chasing down different programs that address efficiency um but that's not included in this grant okay thank you and and Lori we appreciate you joining us uh uh either clay and I had had planned on returning your email uh this afternoon after this webinar so thank you for joining and and we did see your email that came in I appreciate that and I think it's nice that you're putting the links to the side so it's easy for people to get to excellent well thank you for joining you're welcome bye-bye bye-bye thanks Laurie okay we have one more hand up from Scott if you could do the same on mute introduce yourself and ask your is that I'm sorry you cut out was that okay good hi this is uh this is Scott Lindberg from Rogue Community College in Grants Pass first of all thank you for taking the time to set up this webinar it's very informative and I have a question about a uh planning project for a district that has more than one we proposed a construction project uh in the last round that was rejected for being incomplete and were suggested that we that we pursue a planning application so we were doing so for Community energy resilience at our main Redwood campus uh but we are also interested in potentially doing a planning study for renewable energy at our table Rock campus in Jackson County are we able to either submit two separate applications or one application with components of both energy resilience and um renewable energy uh the answer is yes and that yes applies to both uh that really uh becomes uh that becomes your decision on uh how you got how you would want to proceed uh with that application process if you feel it's more advantageous to create two applications uh or if you feel financially and uh and and competitively that emerging into both projects into one application okay and because I don't see the ability in the application to have more than one project location if you if you look at the question where it's talking about the siding um you'll see that it has the form for address of the location you know address City even coordinates right right uh if look at the question above a little look at the uh how the question is worded um as it moves through and you can use the text Field Box to essentially create a second site or you know just listed a site one uh put that information in site to put that information in it was just going to be difficult for us to estimate how many sites a particular project would have so we essentially put the form in for one core address and then you can enter additional site details up in the text box and then but then I would I would also say further down the line as you're moving through the application you would want to separate your information out between a site one and a site 2. so uh you know in the budgeting details of the Finance details you'd be entering in kind of a total of all right but in some of the breakout areas you know you would be listing specific information about the details that you're looking for for the system or the project in the site one or the site two if that if that helps it does immensely think you can't see me giving you a thumbs up but I'm giving you a thumbs up thank you we'll do I'll give you one there thank you great okay I'm gonna hop back into the um there's some great questions here the first one is uh it seems like applicants ask for the grant amount but is there a benefit to noting lower amounts um say 50 of the goal request something about better than none concept I the I think that I'm going to let clay uh come on to the onto uh and give his impression my take is that the first slide that I touched on this is a competitively reviewed um application uh that project could be two thousand dollars and it's going to be reviewed competitively against the projects in its opportunity uh all those projects in its in its opportunity uh announcement so uh a hundred thousand or two thousand in planning or you know 5 000 or a million in construction we look at every project competitively because the size and scale of a particular project for a location may not also be the same um so I guess my answer would be no give it bring bring your projects we want to see your projects and Clay do you want you have anything to add there as well very short I don't think that there is anything in the scoring criteria that would give more points to somebody that comes in with a more economical project in that sense that not asking for as much as they could doesn't fit well into the scoring criteria so I don't see the benefit either yeah and I'll double back on that in one of my slides on the project diversity we talked about the project size as being one of those uh evaluator assessments uh and I think maybe a better way of looking at that is that project's size to its impact in that locality so I I probably should have made that statement a little bit great okay and the next question asks can you please clarify the cost match requirements for renewable versus resilient Construction Grants um can we repeat that one I got that one I got that one okay oh go ahead thanks sure the um we just have one opportunity announcement that has a match or only up to 50 percent and that is the construction renewable without a resilience component and that opportunity announcement you know will describe that um and so it's Construction Grants renewable only are only eligible up to 50 percent of the total project cost whereas the other three opportunity announcements offer up to a hundred percent of the total project costs okay and then next we have uh what date uh has Odo committed to get Pas and advanced funds for round one awarded the uh as we are still working through uh getting the performance agreements finalized uh for round one uh and uh getting those out to the awardees to begin moving those projects forward um and so uh I think we've uh clay or I have taken some time to update when when those questions have come in and definitely do appreciate the question uh we do want to keep this webinar and the Q a towards the round two uh applications for this uh for right now but thank you okay great um also is there a contractor um list that can do renewable energy for our program no it's it's not necessarily like the solar Plus Storage um this is there are no specific contractor requirements they would be uh if you do have one selected going into your project uh you would want to include that information it can help with the strength of your project team and and if if the question was asked looking for for a list of of things Energy Trust of organ is a great source of their Affiliated contractors and things like that for some of their programs that's a good a good resource to ask uh for help because Odo especially in the competitive you know we won't um we won't advocate for or provide any list of recommended contractors to stay neutral okay and then we have another clarifying question about timeline uh the renewable energy and storage does it have to be installed within 12 months of the award of the grant say say that one say that one one more time well I heard that one too Jason all right don't go ahead I've got a little scratchiness I have a little scratchiness on my playback it's um it's construction must begin within 12 months of signing the contract or performance agreement and construction of the Renewable Energy System and it's com and its components is what must start and then on construction applications from from the time of the contract you've got three years 36 months to complete that construction okay great uh next we have how soon after the application deadline would a performance agreement be sent if granted the award uh after the application deadline we move into uh what what's what's the next round uh process for us internally so um the on the website you'll see that we have uh the award notification is approximately uh dated we're looking at approximately around uh the first to middle of May around May 8th or in that time frame uh we would still from that point after selection um the our ideal time frame from selection to Performance agreement in hand would be ideally hopefully uh would be in the ballpark of about four months and hopefully that would be a maximum okay great and then I'm gonna hop over to I see a raised hand Heather are you still there and would you like to ask your question I'm here thank you can you hear me okay yes right um so I think maybe a similar question to what was asked before related to if you have a campus that you're exploring Renewables and resiliency for maybe with multiple Civic buildings is there going to be um any I don't know competitiveness or strength the issues if you are wanting to engage your community in a planning process about where you want to prioritize that because that we don't we wouldn't want to be dinged if we weren't coming in with just one specific project on a particular building we'd like to really make this a meaningful engagement with our community about where their priorities are is that going to hurt us if we're not um focusing just on a particular no I think that if I'm understanding your question correctly I think that that engagement uh has the ability to strengthen the project uh could have some opportunities for those added scoring uh program benefits and priorities that we've uh that we spoke about earlier clay do you have anything you want to add there I think you nailed that um the we had several applications in round one that were similar to that campus or compound situations and they were looking at multiple buildings and for planning they wanted that engagement to talk about that with their students or with their residents in the community and so that's a that's a great aspect of the community involvement Community engagement and not required in a planning Grant to have that specific you know rooftop already identified that's so great to hear thank you and I was just curious about um if that also applies to the Consulting fees in terms of eligible costs to have consultant support for small jurisdictions that may not have a lot of staff to be able to have the support that stakeholder engagement as an eligible cost not just for Consultants to do a solar analysis or something like that in in that one it would be I would probably want to get a little",

of just um the question ahead where does learning about the soil contamination may or may not be present fall into the application approval process so that's one thing I took away and with that that concludes my board leadership update and look forward to this month and oh wait Jerry or Jerry you want to go I figure I can so yeah last week had just a few the AOC transportation and Community Development steering committee was was one of them and we talked about they talked about the legislative bills that they were monitoring House Bill 2101 passed that's the stbg fund exchange and stbg stands for surface Transportation okay that's what it is service service Transportation block Transit I looked over here and I got nothing but my friends doing this yeah so uh we have a over here and two F's over there well actually the Eggos over here she gets an a as well um Senate Bill 365 did not pass that but an interim group was created that would authorize the county governing body to charge utilities for a cost incurred for failure to a failure of utilities to relocate in the highway right of way uh tolling that is uh they're holding the Forum on Towing AOC is so anyway bottom line there was several of them in there the good ones are I think the ones the past H Bill hospital 3197 is the uh they regulate the Housing Development regulations be clear and objective and I don't even know why they use terms like clear and objective when you're talking about housing and Land Development but anyway we did get a good shout out from the AOC folks uh Stephen that we were the point of the spear as they defined us and they said we did a really good job of um of getting the modifications through there and working with them so uh I'm giving you credit you got the a that remember okay no Aaron yeah actually they did they gave you credit as well so good job on that um and then Hospital 3201 is the about the broadband and getting the federal money so the state is in line to get 900 million I didn't think it was that much but a lot of money for our Broadband so that's good and then House Bill 1013 was 2D Smith's Bill about homeowners allowing one RV to be on their residential property that passed as well uh met with North Plains yesterday Andy Verner um and got an update on their uh their semiconductor land their Urban growth boundary I know that Catherine Pam has already got theirs nafisa Europe this next week I think and um it's very informational they're they're doing a great job of trying to of course get in the game and they've had quite a plan and then on that could I just ask a question before that comes to us in work session in September Steven uh between Lut and legal can you guys answer the question or get an answer to the question for me of uh does lcdc or yeah does lcdc have a role in affirming Economic Opportunity analysis before they affirm any ugb decision and what is the status of that that's all I think that that will help us uh as we go through what our role is or isn't okay yeah I think that that's a that would be a great thing to do we Andy and I talked a little bit about that yesterday and some of the process and procedures they've still got to go before they get to us so thank you um speaking at the banks city council tonight just giving them uh my usual quarterly update I didn't get it in last quarter because uh they had some um issues with their Council as far as giving me space so I'm a little behind on that have that fair board meeting this week and the fair is coming up remember uh 31 or 30 some 20 to 30 I think it is um but yeah so that's coming up and we'll get an update on where we are with that Northwest act this week also I have cold pack on Thursday but it conflicts with our round table so I will be here for the round table and then heading for uh Scappoose for the Northwest act meeting yep that's why we scheduled the round table so you'd only have to miss one of your two yeah yeah and it'll be good to get an update from kopak because as you know we are in the process of hiring another executive director so well we'll see where that is and then Friday is our odf meeting I'm really looking forward to that too so that's all I got and uh relative to that in the constituent report there's uh informative piece of like the last two pages okay good morning uh it was a quiet week last week but um a lot of things bubbling underneath the surface uh Megan and I had a meeting with Steve Holgate he's a constituents that's interested in climate related issues he's uh he's really good at understanding where we are with our budget and looking for Creative opportunities so I think he'll be testifying in that not too distant future but um he I find him to be very positive in bringing forward some ideas also attended North Plains I think that Megan and I had a very unique experience though we went to lunch at the hitching post and that's quite that's quite a place and what you may not know is that the Hitching Post has one of the finest Chinese chefs who knew that you'd get great Chinese food at the Pidgey post but but you did the only problem was it took about an hour to be served and we were Megan forwarded a note to Andy Berner saying we're going to be about 10 to 15 minutes late but I'll tell you when we walked in and said we were at your local establishment trying to get lunch we got we got brownie points for that but anyway it's uh it's a nice little restaurant and don't you know don't hesitate trying the green beans and chicken so uh that was at the hitching post at the hitching post it was a rogue Pub has really good food too yeah but Chinese food so anyway um this week I have the uh Center cultural board meeting that'll be my last board meeting for Central cultural I talked to Maria uh Rubio she knows and asked me if I would attend the last meeting to talk to the rest of the board about you know what what's happening there but uh it's it's very

Tri-County planning body meeting and uh for that it meant I really had to read the shs oversight committee report it's coming up for us in the next month or two since we had to have it rescheduled it is a great read and one of the things I got out of it for us is the work that is in place for culturally uh supportive culturally responsive Supportive Services so the team has done a really good job on all fronts but particularly there so um a lot of great information I do have a couple of questions that I will type up in email to ask our team about uh and I'll share that with the gold board

Health Public Safety and legal system so a bonus which I didn't know is I actually get uh reimbursement stipend um for doing that so helpful to the county and our budget as well um as I will um in addition be facilitating the county administrator's idea exchange and then attending the now board meeting as the West Coast director do you want to provide an update to your board you've received some recent updates from our Sheriff Garrett on just challenges within our sheriff's office but I want to lift up that we have challenges within our full public safety system here in Washington County including hiring retention of staff changing caseloads demographics and continued unfunded mandates coming forward from the state to really look deeper at this I've asked Aaron culbert to convene our Public Safety and Justice leaders to determine and assemble a project team to begin a system of service analysis that will be a briefing paper to your board and expected to deliver to you in quarter three of this year each department is facing their own challenges but as we know there becomes interconnected challenges across our Public Safety and justice system which impacts our our community on top of the Washington County budget reductions to community correction the state made further reductions of nearly 12 percent and this was not expected at",

requirements on behalf of the cohort um so if you work in a cohort we have a cohort specific application um we'll ask for information on each of the counties in the cohort and ask each of the counties to sign the application but once we move through into the performance agreement process that will be done with the lead County who will be the grantee with Odo uh plans produced with a cohort must provide each piece of that required content for each County in the cohort so it just needs make sure that is comprehensive for each of the counties and again um all counties in the cohort need to go through their County adoption process for the plan that's produced and then incorporate it into their natural Hazard mitigation plan um so resources uh we have a plan development resources list this is a document that has a variety of links and information that would be helpful in the planning hopefully helpful in the planning process um we have a technical assistance provider list so these are organizations that are potentially a uh available to contract with for plan development we've reached out and contacted them um this is a topic in their areas of expertise there are some resources for meeting those mapping requirements um example plans from communities across the US and Canada and you know these are really great um examples of how other communities have approached energy resilience planning none of them specifically meet um House Bill 3630 requirements but they certainly give a lot of ideas of um what that content can look like and places these plans can go um you know some other resources for planning Publications and then finally uh Project funding and technical assistance opportunities so these are resources for um for for ta and for funding for actual project implementation so you've completed your planning and now you're looking to put things on the ground we want to get you set up to find resources um that can help you do that once you complete your plan and these could also be opportunities you might want to know in your plan in terms of the implementation pieces of opportunities you may pursue um our website that is here's the link and again we'll we'll get that dropped in the chat too if we haven't already um so that has all the key overview information of our program um some things I want to call out specifically there's a great faq's document has a lot of in-depth information we really tried to Think Through what would be folks questions around this this program and we'll update it as we get more um these webinars will be the recordings will be available up on our website um and of course our plan development resources list is up there and the applications can't forget the applications very important um we wanted to just make a note that uh in in the statute and House Bill 3630 utilities are directed to um collaborate with with counties around uh requests for energy infrastructure information in their County so if you have a utility in your county that's serving customers or operating infrastructure um you know they're a resource for you um they there's a lot of elements of the plans where utilities really might be a great partner and have some great information to share certainly around mapping your energy infrastructure you know things like inventorying the energy consumption of your critical Public Services facilities um um yeah so just wanted to make a note of that and then lastly like Max noted um I am here to be I'm the program coordinator I'm here to be a resource happy to meet have a phone call um you know answer questions at any point and once you're you know hopefully enrolled and going in the program also happy to be a resource if you have further questions or you know you wonder if we might know someone who could answer a question things like that like please don't hesitate to reach out um so with that I think I have hit all the main points and I'm going to take a pause and open up the floor to all of you to see if you have question we have a lot of great questions coming in on the chat so amazing I have been kind of coordinating them in um I'm gonna play the Vana um and ask them um the first one just um to verbally state it um that a copy of the slide deck will be available on the page as soon as possible after um this as well as the recording of everything we're talking about so both of those things will be um available as soon as possible um there um we have a bunch of really great questions um particularly from um Grant County as well as John um with multnoma County apologies John from one complicated last name to the next I'm not going to try um but I'm going to um start uh with his uh first question which is what is the planning definitions of short medium and outages that's a great question yeah Max uh yeah thanks uh I look at shortterm as hours medium-term as days and longterm as weeks being without power you don't have to do that it's not set in uh statute but that's the definition that I that's how I think about it perfect um and then the second question or it's less of a question and more of a comment and I think it is worth addressing is um that these are a lot of requirements for $50,000 especially for a county um that's quite large like Moma County but also for some of our more rural counties that are um huge uh that have um people and facilities and other hazards that are um large and spread out um so I think that's something that would be worth addressing um in an acknowledgement that we get it um and that it is uh quite large uh we're hoping um to do our do your best and also um I think that's the um exciting part about the cohort model um is kind of the collaboration of funds is there anything else S I might just add that go ahead we agree we know about um it does seem like requirements might be a lot for the for the amount of money this is how the legislator authorized a program and so we're administering it uh but I'd be glad to talk or Hannah and I would be glad to talk about how best to you know meet the requirements um while still utilizing the funding that's available and Sarah's got the good point about the cohort option uh to be able to pool money for a little more money broader re reach um so something to consider there absolutely oh go ahead go ahead sorry yeah and we're you know we are keeping our eyes and ears open for potential funds that counties could access to you know help build on with these programs um we just encountered a resource that might be applicable to some communities uh Federal funding opportunity correct me if I'm wrong Sarah for Coastal and Rural communities um so you know we do acknowledge it the the I believe the number in the legislature did come from projections from organizations that are involved in this work how ever we we definitely hear concerns around how far this funding will go so uh Justin I see your hand but I'm going to go through the questions in the chat first and then we can get to um verbal questions and comments um the next question is um I can see why the state would like to have all this information from every county is this state planning Grant opportunity requirement U that's a great question no this is this is a um counties can choose to do this planning counties can choose to participate in this program so um it is not a requirement it is optional you know but um really I think offers strong benefits to your community for energy resilience emergency preparedness and other aligned goals you may have around energy around Development perfect um the next question is from Grant County Emergency Management um what if that the hazard isn't quote natural could be incorporated into our EOP or both would that me meet the yes sorry Hannah go ahead no you're great um I'm I'm interested I was going to say this the statute says very clearly that these plans should be incorporated into your natural Hazard mitigation plans as well as formally adopted by your County however um how you do that how that works for you is is up to your county to figure out that incorporation and certainly if there are other plans with which you'd like to combine them or incorporate them that that is great too um so I'm gonna now defer to Max and see what he thinks I agree with you annna I think that's the answer is the statute does say natural hazards mitigation plan that's where you incorporate it but that's not the only way and I think it certainly makes sense to to tailor a a plan that supports what the county might need and emergency planning is uh an important part of how this can and should be utilized um I just want to uh quickly touch on uh John's point in the in the chat about cohorts um which goes along with the next question is Odo coordinating the cohorts if you had a cohort of Three Counties you would $150,000 total each County in the cohort $50,000 this isn't if you create a cohort it's $50,000 it's that each County that is created that's in the cohort each receives $50,000 so um but the question is is Odo cohorts um we're not coordinating formally in that we're directing counties how to uh do that coordination themselves outside of uh our formal Grant processes right so if you would like to work in a cohort um that's excellent as I mentioned you'll submit there is a specific application for counties that want to work together in cohorts as Sarah mentioned um you know each County can request their full Award $50,000 and then that will be distributed directly to the lead County that cohorts identify um and that is the way that we're trying to reduce administrative burden um and I I assume or I should say I think that would be a way that we are approaching coordination just in terms of your interfacing with us we want to make it easier on you so",

        "text": " local communities would like to implement with this you know we have some communities that just want to talk about um emissions period we have some that want to talk about you know developing um resources that provide significant local economic we are trying to do something that allows for both um this slide is really helpful because it shows that it's the general umbrella Provisions about um you know how customers get charged the program mechanics in terms of you know how decisions are made and then that last one risk allocation is really important I'll pause here to see if there are any questions with what I've got so far question so far I don't think we have any so far okay great so to talk briefly about risk allocation I want to just explain what how that works and why um one Bedrock concept of any voluntary utility program is that the customers that are choosing to take on additional costs bear the risk because it would be not not fair to let say um you know the M County County C IL make a decision that could increase costs for customers in Salem OR Hillsboro or anywhere else right um it's just it would be allowing one local government to make decisions on behalf of folks that are outside of its jurisdiction And to clarify in this context when you're saying customer you mean the city the county whatever the jurisdiction is you're not talking about individual households or business oh thank you for that clarification in this particular example we are saying um residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else so if Salem moves forward with this we are talking about costs that will be paid by residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem we have other options if it's the City of Salem for you know on on if if you if we're talking about just meeting the city of Salem's um owned man like at at city of own buildings but that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about a a tariff that would be broadly applicable to um all residential and small commercial customers in Salem unless they opt out so that's the part I was not clear on when you because you were talking about it being optional and I understand it's optional for jurisdictions I didn't really realized it would be optional for individual customers within that jurisdiction yes and yeah and that's required by the law what hp21 says is that for this this is an opt out program so you customers would get a letter in the mail and probably plenty of other Communications um that say Hey you know the Salem City Council voted to create this program you are automatically opted in you have some number of Bill Cycles to let PGE know that you don't want to be in um but that's how it works works thank you okay one followup question if I could I understand that counil have a choice between opt in or out opt out programs is that the case or is it mandatory opt in it's mandatory opt out and that's that's something that's in HP 2021 we have no flexibility there thank you okay that actually is a really helpful um intro to this risk allocation um which I've already started to touch fundamentally if any local jurisdiction in our service area says we want to do this it means that the costs of doing this of implementing a community green tariff are on that Community permanently there there is no offramp once the money is spent there is an off-ramp for money that has hasn't been spent yet but you know once we sign a long-term contract for a new resource to serve folks in the City of Salem um to help Salem meet its climate goals um there there's no way to sort of turn that off and let me just tell you why the answer is because there's only two places to put costs it's either on the people in the City of Salem after the City of Salem votes to um create this program or it's all of our other customers and you can see immediately how it's just really unfair to say to people in any other city that we serve you know Salem City Council voted to do this thing and now you have to pay there's just sort of like a representative democracy problem right there where you know people in um Sandy or Government Camp can't vote you all at office so that's not really an appr appropriate option for um yeah by money spent you mean the investment in the infrastructure to provide the the electricity is that correct correct yeah oh see see we're on a we're not on the oops we're seeing your you you'll see that my my one clarifying question was who is the mayor and I apologize for nothing that's all right our room isn't the best setup here yeah now I can actually see you this better so this is good um I'll keep going while Steve gets that slide back up um so the Terra filing like I was saying was very is very Universal it's like we can slide anything through it on behalf of the community as we discuss the community's there k out looks like steeve got knocked out um then the participation agreement which we'll get that slide back up in a minute um the participation agreement is where we hammer out the details to say you know um Salem would like a combination of utility scale solar and you know small Hydro and um I don't know some some batteries at City Hall or something like that just for example um that's where we negotiate those specific items um we're doing that very intentionally because we want to make sure that communities have the space to work with PGE on their local priorities that's also where we talk about price we are working to get some sort of very representative pricing for communities we're hoping that have that done in the next couple of weeks but that's going to extremely let's say directionally accurate um but it's really going to depend on choices that communities make what does directionally accurate mean um it means that the data that we have is more or less what large resources that are sized to help meet a utility's overall demand you know we 900,000 customers about um resources of that scale like you can think like large solar facilities or large wind facilities or large batteries um that is going to be helpful as you all make price make decisions to sort of know what that stuff would cost we are currently running an RFP for small resources for um cbes for um communitybased renewable energy that's going to give us more pricing data for smaller resources um but this is the first time that we're running a procurement specifically for smaller stuff we will have more information for you as we move forward in that process one thing that's a little bit confusing to me about this is as I have no idea whether we'll even entertain the the idea considering this you know we're just right now wanting to learn sure but if we were to that point where we wanted actually consider this how would we given that it's an opt out possibility how would we know how much money there would be to for investment in infrastructure when we when we don't know how many people would opt out that's an excellent question the answer is um by doing collectively our homework up front um you know we're never going to know exactly how many customers opt out um but you know we have data points we know how many folks in any particular City are enrolled in pge's existing voluntary green programs already um and then it would be absolutely worthwhile doing some very um careful polling um and having really honest conversations with your communities um about what this is going to cost and what it's going to deliver to the city um but um I mean this is this is a big decision um and there are ways to sort of mitigate that risk like I would not recommend that on day one you sign um or you have PGE sign on your behalf a 20-year contract for a large solar facility in eastern Oregon because you know you're right what happens if you get 50% of your um residents opting out well that's going to be a big problem so it would probably makes sense to sort of start slower and build smaller things um where you know the cost um is is you spread over 20 years or so is more manageable just to sort of test the waters and see you know okay if we have a $2 a month Bill impact we only have a 8% opt out rate or something like that that would be a good thing to know before you go out and do something that's going to have a 10 or 12 or $15 a month Bill impact and again these are just numbers I'm giving you for the sake of discussion they're not real numbers at all understood thank you I have a question yeah can you give us an idea of how many people are enrolled in the voluntary green program currently I can't but PGE certainly can we we I believe we have that data on um all cities in our jurisdiction I think that would be interesting context to have like what is Salem you know we at 50% 10% I mean I have no idea I wonder work in advance to try and increase that number right before we commit to anything else mayor mayor Hoy we can provide you that number in terms of the number of residents we can get that number pretty quickly to you it's not heavily advertised I I'm on it I had to find it yeah that would be great Wendy thank you yep yeah we have I can't tell you that pges is the highest um is as a percentage of customers is the largest in the country we we have um a lot of customers on it interesting good um Steve can you skip this Slide Five um I think I'm on Slide Five actually oh you customer pricing yeah you are great um like I said Steve just will intuitively know where where to go except when he get gets the wrong screen up yeah that was that was um it just showed some of my political ignorance um okay so you know this is showing you sort of with words what this is going to cost and I want to be really clear about what we're asking communities to pay for we are not asking communities to pay for every cent of what a new resource is going to cost we are just going to ask communities to pay for what percentage of that new resource is above what pge's cost would be otherwise so you can sort of think of us as having a baseline cost which um all customers are going to pay and then the increment above it is what residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else would pay um so Steve let's go to uh slide seven I",

fair Kellen has been great she sent the gis file I don't have a fancy program but she went back to tetr Tech and had them break it down into a kmz program that can be loaded into to Google Earth Pro which is a free program so I have the maps with the new boundaries and all that I am out in the field with the landowners showing them this stuff but I do not have the grazing layers I do not have the dami layers I don't have those things so the public does not have those things so how can they respond responsibly to the oars to determine is the site certificate needing the standards are not and they don't have that ability yet you do Google Earth can be put on the web with all the details your maps that you have up on the website are good but they're not granula and they don't have the map sets on them so the public doesn't really know what's being done on their land so if you come down to negotiations for price they don't know what they got do they have an artifact on the land they haven't seen the texure check report or they don't have the layer so there's lots of things that we need to sort through in order to know do we have enough information to properly respond to the DPO so that's my two cents and I thank you for your time thank you for your comments Mr CER do we have anyone else Nancy uh we do have a call-in user with their hand up um your number begins with 54185 I'm GNA uh unmute your mic and you are ready to well I thought I was okay I'm trying to unmute your mic so don't touch any buttons all right you are unmuted could the caller please state your name maybe it looks like they've lowered hand okay so um anyone else in the room wish to provide public comment none there um no one on the phone and no one on the webinar okay hold I think I have hands popping up now do a last call here no we have we do have more now it looks like that call-in user has raised their hand again all right so you are unmuted call-in user if you want to go ahead and make your comment could the call-in person wishing to testify can provide can you hear provide your name and address we can hear you now thank you okay Irene Gilbert 2310 Adams Avenue lant Oregon okay yes all right um I just wanted to um Number One support the uh comments about the need we uh I'm getting a lot of feedback I don't know why I'm not on speaker but uh anyway I wanted to uh state that the request for an extension of time I support that I also wanted to make a couple of different comments one is regarding the rxs and there was some discussion about trying to get new people or more people involved uh my comment is that Ru making is a legal process with statutes that Define limits and opportunities ing rules the rules are complex and without experience with applying the existing rules it's really difficult to identify what is lacking how rules are being interpreted and how changes likely will be implemented the um impacts are often subtle the time commitment is significant and it can be a rating process for the public due to a perceived lack of uh influence in the final product so are you getting as much feedback as I am no we're hearing it just fine okay so um the other one that I wanted to comment on just based on my recent experience and that is the process since the rules are now being considered for the contested case issue and the council has the role of assuring that there's a fair and balanced process and currently the um the contested case rules are not userfriendly in my mind the current for the current process the applicant works with Oregon Department of energy for sometimes years in development of the application and the draft proposed order during during that time relationships are developed and basically Odo takes ownership of the site certificate and application late in the process um The public's provided an opportunity to review this draft proposed order that is um has been developed by Odo and that they are recommending be accepted the um the the the time frame for public comment after we receive that is often short there's off there often usually hundreds of pages of application material and um DPO and uh things to review so the public is then in a position of needing to basically argue the issues that they don't agree with once that process is done the proposed order comes out and again Odo um is supporting the draft proposed order the public can ask for a contested case and here's where we get into the current rule revision because uh oftentimes the request is denied but if it is approved then the public is goes before um a hearings officer that's hired by Odo and we have to respond to uh odo's arguments that the the site certificate is adequate also the developer argues that the site certificate is adequate and virtually all contested cases from the public end up being denied during that hearing which then goes to the Oregon Supreme Court in the Oregon Supreme Court again the public bases Oregon Department of energy attorneys and um the developers attorneys now the way the process currently goes if the at the if the um decision is made early on that is the contested Cas is denied then it goes to the Circuit Court and I can kind of speak from my current experience right now because I made a request to the Circuit Court for a reconsideration of a decision of uh the council and once that motion was made both the Oregon Department of energy and developer challenged whether or not the application should go to the Circuit Court so rather than arguing my request for consideration I ended up having to argue about so that requires a lot of study uh fortunately I did win that um that uh request for jurisdiction change so it stayed with the the Circuit Court then Odo and the developer asked for what they call aend mandus order which would basically have said that the Circuit Court made a mistake stake and the case should really should have gone to the Oregon Supreme Court so again I had to put together arguments based on this um mandamus request which has its own set of rules um the Supreme Court did um they denied the request for a jurisdiction transfer so I'm thinking that now is the time when my contested case is going to be heard but that wasn't so next the Oregon Department of energy and the developer asked for a um basically they asked to throw out my Cas as being mute so again this requires study of a new set of rules and responses to that request arguing against my case being uh thrown out as you know that decision is still not been made all the all the argu ments have been put in and the the uh face Toof face hearing has been held but but the bottom line here is Odo when when you're dealing with contested cases Odo and the developer basically form a single unit with multiple attorneys and it's very difficult for the public to deal with this system so as you're reviewing the rules for contested cases is when you um put in place rules that make it more difficult for the public to have a fair and balanced hearing um it the system is already really balanced against the public and so I would just ask that you really think about whether or not you want to make um the access to a contested Cas is more difficult and especially since if unless the case is heard in the contested case or it's a challenge against the actual approval or rejection of a site certificate they go to the the uh circuit court and so there's no point in making it harder for people to obtain a contested case before Odo because they will either have that case record developed in front of the agency or they will have it developed in front of the circuit court so that's just sort of what I'd like you to keep in mind as you're looking at the rule revision for contested cases thank you thanks for your comments Miss Gilbert um anyone else wishing to provide public comment uh yes chair how I do see that Wendy King has her hand raised so Wendy I'm going to going to go ahead and unmute your mic and you are ready to comment 337 Southwest pus Avenue Apartment 303 Redmond Corgan I too would like to ask for additional time with the b2h rfa1 um it appears that um because of our location in Marrow County we are multiple um energy projects that we are trying to um provide um to be involved with I guess I should say um currently we are considering a contested case for the Wheat Ridge East rfa1 um and we also have the the b2h line that's directly to with and a half a mile about to our north um it looks like it's at a considerable boundary to its site and we're extremely concerned and really haven't taken the time to pour through that DPO but we intend to um in addition our family has drafted a public comment letter concerning the contested case rules that we encountered with B2 and I hope this letter makes its way to your your committee um as it is in response to some of the questions uh counselor Condon and bu asked of us in the last fsac meeting um and with that I that that is all thank you Miss King anyone else wishing to make comment there are no hands raised at time okay we'll give one minute here for a final still none Nancy okay we'll the time is 10:27 and we'll close the uh public period the next item is the wheat wheat Rich renewable energy East request for Amendment one review of the draft proposed order Christopher Clark senior sighting analyst will have the floor I thank you thank you chair how members of the council for the record my name is Christopher Clark I am a senior sighting analist for the Department um as chair how just mentioned I'm here to talk about um weid renewable energy facility East and um assist the Council with your review of the draft proposed order for request for Amendment one I can get slide um thank you uh so I covered a lot of this material at the March council meeting uh so I'm not going to go over it in detail but feel free to stop me if you would like um but this request

you on that before with new layers or updated data layers next counties would be able to go through their own mapping process related to renewable energy sighting and there would be grant funding provided by dlcd for that purpose and then finally Odo would be given funds that fsec could provide to public bodies tribal governments and Community organizations to participate in the upside process so something like an intervener funding much of that would be the details of that would be established in a follow-up rulemaking that fsec would have to do the the language in the bill was pretty thin about how that would actually apply so a lot of that would have to be established through rulemaking and that bill is currently at Ways and Means so again the the big takeaway there is like everybody else we're waiting to see what happens with the session and uh if if anything moves forward from here on out Todd this is Marcy can you repeat what you said about um I think it was the second thing you said about the counties or actually the third thing about the counties updating I think I missed something yeah so the the basic idea of the bill is that you know we would we would convenience stakehold a bunch of stakeholders and go through and sort of identify uh areas of lower Conflict for renewable energy and transmission citing and then also look at sort of streamlining opportunities um both at the kind of fsec level and at the lcdc level that would apply to um that would sort of be the you know broader approach but then the idea was to give counties the ability to do goal five inventory mapping or kind of go through their own process at the local level and provide funding to them so if they did that then um they could have you know a little more local sort of evaluation about how that would apply you know within their jurisdiction so someone you know pretty much the same as the first bullet that I talked about but really it would be more of a low local evaluation okay thank you chair Grail yes Cindy Conan I just have a question um with respect to 3179 and I probably should have um done some work on this but given the increases in acreage and um metrics for the facilities of the existing site applications we have or projects that are being developed now um do you have a a number or a sense of how many of those would not have been under f-sec jurisdiction if those limits change yeah doing a it was a pretty high level look but I did look at all of our current uh applications and determined that really only one would have met the uh sort of change threshold um but then there was a question of whether that actually had more high value Farm ground than was submitted in the application so so one possibly you know really I think the bigger question is would any of those have altered their acreages to not be within f-sec um so so that's where moving forward you know you know you're looking at the numbers and would that influence anybody to make changes you know going back to you know the wind boom um you know in the you know early mid 2000s the threshold for fsec was 105 megawatts there are many many 104 megawatt uh County jurisdictional projects out there um and just to follow up on that so are the counties uh supportive of this change uh I mean I think there was only a couple counties that really sort of participated so whether they're universally supportive of this or not I don't know um but I know there was a couple counties who Who provided comment and were supportive of it thank you thank you for your comment and I'd just like to remind or I guess not remind I'd like to tell everyone I because I'm having issues with my phone I can't see folks so please just speak up um and if there's anything I'm missing I'd ask a vice chair how or Todd to flag a person I apologize this was not the best device to call in on okay well definitely keep an eye out thank you sure uh this is Kim yes follow-up question uh for secretary Cornett on that um are there any data yet has this been you know where the counties are doing more applications um for citing energy facilities is there a track record yet on the appeals process they're going through uh I mean I did a little bit of research on that so they're you know in 2019 House Bill 2329 increased the thresholds to what they are now and I kind of describe what those are um there are reporting requirements associated with those projects and we've received um notification of eight projects that went through that kind of house bill 2329 process and to my knowledge two of those uh were appealed uh one went all the way up to court of appeals and then kind of backed down to the county so you know it kind of did the many of what you see at the land use who went to the land use board of appeals and then you know sort of um you know some up and down remanding balance back down at the county that was related to implementation of the natural resource protection requirements and so that one is still unresolved and then there was a second one same owner uh project owner and I think that one has been challenged and I think that one's sort of on hold as well so to my knowledge I think just two of them have been chat two of the eight have been challenged okay thanks great questions thank you okay last on my list are future meetings so uh you please saw the emails yesterday so we've been trying to get the draft proposed order hearings figured out for the Boardman Hemingway Amendment one so those got rescheduled um so we were thinking those would be at the June the later June meeting of this um that's not going to happen so we've changed the June meeting um to just June 23rd or the second June meeting to June 23rd and that will be a morning meeting virtually only just like this so that should only be a couple of hours and then July we sent out the email seeking uh whether you were all available or not for the 17th 18th and 19th so the idea there would be that the July 17th we would be in Baker City for an evening public hearing July 18th we would be in Pendleton for a evening public hearing and then July 19th we would also be in Pendleton for the regular council meeting several of you have responded with your availability for those who haven't please uh send an update to Nancy as soon as you can so we can determine whether or not we will have enough for a quorum for that meeting and with that that concludes my Council secretary report thank you very much secretary Barnett any further questions all right well hearing none we'll move on to the next agenda item which is the presentation of the Department of land conservation and developments farm and Forest land use report this is an information item we have Hillary foot from Department of land conservation and development farm and Forest Specialists to present welcome Hillary hi welcome um thank you very much for having me here today and good morning um so I am Hilary foot I'm the farm and Forest land use specialist for the Department of land conservation and and I have to thank Todd for having me here today to review um certain sections of the 2020 2021 biennial farm and Forest land use Report with you um and should I just ask to have those slides advanced yes Hillary I got it okay so next slide all right and they'll win after that one um so today I'm going to be talking about a report that the land conservation and development commission has been providing to the legislature for over 38 years it's a statutory obligation that we have and it's intended to provide some insight into how well our zoning-based working lands conservation program has been performing and achieving the objectives that have been set out for it for Statewide planning goals three and four so bringing to mind that old adage that you can't manage that you can't measure that's really what this report attempts to do um so today I'm going to be giving an abbreviated version of this presentation I'm only going to talk about farmlands we're going to put forest lands aside um I'm going to start with a little bit of the historical context for the goal 3 Program the Farmland conservation and I'm going to touch on Farmland conversions some different ways that we look at it in this particular Port there's a lot of different types of ways to look at it and that it has been looked at by a number of academics and research papers but I'm going to talk about the farm and Forest and lastly we're going to focus on data that was included in the last farm and reforest report on solar sighting and that was included there's about six page section included in the last Prime and Forest report that was a response to a from the board of Agriculture to look at how well our rules have been functioning on encouraging solar sighting on more appropriate locations so next slide uh just getting right into one of the really important things to understand about exclusive Farm use zoning is that it is and always has been associated with attacks program and it predates the land use planning program by over a decade exclusive Pharmacy zoning was originally standardized Statewide in 1963 as part of an incentive tax program that kind of went like this if you were a farmer you could volunteer to have your property enrolled in the program the county would apply a restrictive exclusive",

        "text": " is a lot of advanced manufacturing that part of that supply chain that does a lot of the research related to semiconductor work throughout Washington County so you know being close in and having that industry tightly together Washington county is the fourth being looked at and we need to see what those recommendations are before Weaver County really address those but that is something at the end of the day if something moves forward in Washington County out of that task force there will likely be work for planning and land is consideration within Washington County in addition to that land the land use writ large there's also a bunch of Concepts around planning at large um some of that goes to concerns that the development Community has raised about the speed of the process to get from I have a piece of property I'd like to develop all the way through final certificate of occupancy and that has some impacts on how our land use and transportation department fundamentally works and we have to make sure that it meets the needs of everyone and keeps the county financially secure but sees um we find those windows of opportunity to really enhance and better the development process at a local level and then feed make sure that we're not being inhibited at the state level from Meeting those needs and and protecting the county from fiscal irresponsibility and also making sure that we have a capacity to do the work that they expect of us the other big planning issue that is going to come up is a little bit more targeted than some of those placeholders we have related to how the development Community would like to see change occur and that's related to what is called the climate friendly and Equitable communities rule making the department of land conservation and development did over the course of the last year which will have profound impacts on the work that this Planning Commission and the county writ large does in the planning World there have been some concerns about how those rules the process by which the rules were enacted but also the outcomes that may or may not occur that is expected versus what the reality will look like in the ground and the legislature has taken notice of those concerns and also has raised their own set of concerns about the authority that the department worked under given that there was no legislative impetus for that work um this is part of also you may have read in the news ongoing litigation between some local jurisdictions and the state related to the implementation of these rules um I my assumption is that our land use and transportation department has provided you guys some levels of updates about what work we can foresee coming to the Planning Commission to enact those rules and make sure that we are in compliance with state land use planning but I foresee at least a conversation if not a change coming out of the legislature and what dlcd has required of local governments to accomplish these things no one disagrees with the goals what we just what both have raised are concerns about the ability to actually Implement and that implementation actually having the effects that they are aiming for which is creating more access to um the modes of transportation that reduce greenhouse gases um creating more centralized areas where we do more comprehensive planning that are are supposed to work towards that greenhouse gas reduction and also just system-wide Transportation updates that can be quite um I'm going to use the word onerous but really I mean in-depth and complicated um I just speak with an opinion sometimes as opposed to just a clear statement of the objective facts so going forward through this section we'll really be looking at what the legislature wants to change about that climate-friendly and Equitable communities rule making and how we can go back to the drawing board and make sure that we're all part of the process in an effective manner in addition focus a little bit more on housing the department of land conservation and development and the Oregon Housing and Community Services Department have released a report to the legislature called the Oregon housing needs analysis and a major component of that document and report is recommendations back to the state legislature about changes to the housing planning process that need to be made in their estimation that help reach that what is now estimated at 170 unit shortfall that we have in the housing units needed in Oregon never mind the growth we anticipate needing on top of that so sometimes you hear 140 sometimes you hear 170 shortage but it's a pretty big number there are cities that don't even have that many there are many cities that don't have that many units built over the course of 50 20 um or even that many units in their in their jurisdictions and we need to meet that across the state so the Oregon housing needs analysis provides for a bunch of proposed um changes to the housing statutes for planning purposes that will have impacts on both the county and our constituent cities as well as impacts to the Metro Regional government and the overall State investment in in housing planning so it's a pretty comprehensive review so I'm going to pause just because I don't know the protocol I see a hand is raised so I'm happy to answer questions as I move along because I don't have anything written so go ahead so go ahead commissioner podar thank you um thanks and um I wanted to just clarify I couldn't um I think I maybe missed 170 units could you just elaborate on that a little bit just to go back and say that again because if I'll be just 170 units short of providing housing to people or what is it I meant 170 000. units so I don't know if that was lack of clarity or lack of um sleep on my body where I dropped that thousand so it's 170 000 units that's Statewide we are short in housing so I apologize for that confusion it's early morning for me as well across the continent so I I guess it got lost over the oceans but I was like 170 units but thank you gotten lost in my own internal translation as well so thank you for asking that clarifying question 170 000 elephants and that's units of all types it's um multi-family it's single family it's Town Homes it's duplexes it's you know executive housing across the board there are shortages um in every community in every County for meeting the needed housing and I think that that's pretty apparent and so what the organ housing needs analysis or sometimes you'll hear it shorthanded as Ona which is a really fun acronym uh but that needs analysis is looking at how we can incentivize how we can provide the infrastructure for um how we can kind of delegate authorities to different levels of government for making sure that we are actually striding closer and closer reducing that number as opposed to constantly barely keeping up with the current level of growth um and starting to backfill and I will say that um there are land use components to this there will be probably planning Implement implications for the county it's that the legislative concept that has been introduced is very um early review process but it's really impactful in Washington County in the urban unincorporated areas where um there are some moves to create city-like responsibilities for the county which is going to be a challenge because Counties have a very particular role and we need to look at how Urban Development occurs with a plan for an urban service provider to be providing the levels of service that are required to actually make livable built communities where people can thrive in their communities um and continue to be part of Washington County so our partnership with the cities within Washington County but also the Metro Regional government in this process as well as our sister counties is going to be part of the ongoing conversation where we're going to suss out where those impacts to County work and Planning Commission work will also and then the final big picture Hot Topic that everyone loves and adores is there's a bridge that needs replacement and we have to pay for it and that bridge process from one state to another so nothing is simple about it and that is the major component of the transportation work that is going to be done in the legislature this year and um in addition to that and as part of that is the conversation around tolling will um so those are some big implications for you know parts of Washington County where diversion and planning for it need to occur creating alternatives to driving on the infrastructure that's going to be told are but also the Flowback which is I just maybe made that word up but basically the impacts of delays when it comes to an interstate Bridge backing up that then backs up all the way into Washington County because everything is connected in this region through our transportation infrastructure so there was a lot of various topics I am happy to answer um and I constantly keep my land use depart my land you're just in transportation department in the loop about as much as I know as often as I um so we could they can then help you guys keep informed about what's happening at the legislature but I'm happy to take any further questions or leave you to Stu on all of the concepts that are out there and then say that legislature is a little bit crazy thank you are there questions for Ms commissioner pachillo yes thank you chair Mr I yeah housing has been obviously a you know with the election season behind us I mean everyone was talking about it it's a problem across the state across the country um relative to any bills um are there bills dealing with um the terms and conditions I guess or fine-tuning of middle housing that's one question and two is are there any bills that you're aware of since I you hear rumors of what people might introduce and then what the rumors are and what the reality is is often everyone sort of waits to see and you're probably the one of the few people who hasn't seen some of these is there anything related to manufactured housing being that has been introduced as to the first question related to Middle housing I haven't seen anything specific but I haven't finished reading the bill for implementation of the Oregon housing needs analysis um to see if they're making any um instructional changes to House Bill 2001's requirements so at this point I don't know that there's anything in there related to adjustments there I think so many cities and Counties have just gotten through the process of adopting their required changes to their comprehensive plans but it's never too late to see something as to manufacture housing there are a couple of bills that are relating to manufactured housing but they're still placeholders is what we call this so the way that Oregon legislature works is every bill has what's called a relating to clause which limits the scope of the policy changes that could be placed",

        "text": " there was no power for most of us living here in Salem for you know several days or even weeks in a row um and you know we've had other disasters we've had the the forest fire smoke in the fall of 2020 um where the air quality was dramatically affected and the canyon was burnt out uh it's my understanding that FEMA utilized our airport and it's just one example of the importance of that resource in ways that community members not may not have on top of mind so for me being concerned about natural disaster a potential or near guarantee at some point in our future of a seismic event affecting us in a way that I don't think any of us can fully appreciate until it happens I look at this as a really important for that preparation in terms of you know emergency preparation and disaster preparation once we get to the 10 000 you know flights of commercial commercial air service we get opened up for federal funding for capital projects to the tune of nearly a million dollars a year 800 900 000 a um so I I think that that's really important and I just want to verify that we could really benefit from that like it's a significant airport and and maintaining an airport is expensive so getting federal assistance I mean I want to make sure that staff agree that that is helpful counselor I think it's ten thousand emplainments and not ten thousand flights which is a significant difference so it's 10 000 people getting on an airplane not ten thousand flights that's correct ten thousand people get on an airplane and counselor just to add on to that uh yes the the the state of Oregon uh and FEMA have identified Salem airport as a a major transshipment point for emergency supplies and and after especially after a Cascadia subduction earthquake event uh one of the there's two major goal goals that we have in public works when it comes to to debris clearance after an earthquake number one is clearing routes to hospitals so we can get to you and then clearing the airport and fixing any damage to the airport that's how important the airport is to the uh the response to a regional a regional disaster thank you thank you Council are there other questions counselor Gonzalez just want to share some comments I am talking about the passenger experience mark Portland is not the best at all you know um so I just wanted to throw that out there because that's probably the worst part about flying is dealing with PDX now the other thing you'll notice is PDX keeps growing they keep adding terminals I mean it just doesn't stop so the flights the amount of flights keep growing for you know for whatever reason us having service here the way I see it is Salem finally taking responsibility for our missions because all we're doing is quantifying how much is outside our boundary and what isn't so in a way right now we're really just pushing it off on somebody else so for us to be able to count it now now we can actually take responsibility and move forward with whatever options we have and also uh Trevor I want to thank you for bringing it up but when you talk about a Latino Community yes it in this case this Latino Community is newer it's a young Latino Community it's highly immigrant you know so for me to have more options for some of these families to go see their family sometimes they haven't seen them in it's very important for me just wanted to share my support for this thank you counselor that's an important perspective I'm glad you shared that I guess I have I wanted to share some thoughts as well and I'm not trying to convince you because this isn't a voting item it's an information item but the one right after this is so you can think of these thoughts when you're thinking of how to vote I suppose on item 5B but so I I've been torn on this issue I've been hearing from our constituents on both sides of this issue it's you know to me it's it's not clear-cut there are there are positives there are negatives to the whichever decision we make but what's really how I've really thought about this and I've been thinking about a lot of things since I've taken this seat I think that Salem is in a period of we're in a period of coming from a small to more of a bigger city you know we are the second largest city in Oregon although most people outside of Salem don't know that and I think maybe a lot of people inside of Salem don't know it either but we really are the second largest city in Oregon uh sorry Eugene it's not you so no matter no matter how you try to do the math uh it is Salem but yet we don't always own that and we haven't always owned that and I think that a lot of the I think that the city bureaucracy hasn't always owned that and in my mind this is sort of a coming-of-age type situation we have the opportunity to I think we're the largest state capital in the country without Commercial Air Service you know that's that's that's a significant thing I've been thinking about things and some of the opportunities I've had recently to think about Salem in a bigger context and that's one of the things that I've been thinking about the other thing I think about and I've thought about this uh for years and I apologize Mr Pascal no offense meant but the the airport takes up a lot of land in our city like it's a huge amount of space that we could be using for a lot of other things like housing and other things but we have this asset obviously that's not going to happen we have this asset but it isn't used by everybody it's used by a very small small demographic a very I mean the people apparently who are moving here who have planes I didn't know they existed but apparently they do uh it's it's not used by very many people I mean 45 000 operations is a lot but I think I would be interested to know like how many how many individuals is that it's probably not huge so in my mind you a better utilization of that huge asset that we have in the middle of our city by more people makes more sense you know having more people utilizing this thing uh I think I think it just the way the way it works currently you know it's a it's a big resource for not a lot of uh benefit for for a lot of folks so in my mind Commercial Air Service kind of levels that playing field a little bit and it spreads that out a little bit more and so I understand the concerns I'm very committed to reducing greenhouse gas um and I know that this might not help but I know we're doing a lot of other things that will and we're going to make other decisions that will and so I think we need to do everything we can something regarding offsets I love the idea that that counselor Stapleton throughout there and I'm really looking forward to exploring that further but I think it's time for Salem to come of age and I think that this is one more step getting us there so that's those are my thoughts so and I know that's not a we're not in deliberations but I just wanted to share that are there any other questions or comments for staff on this all right well thank you staff for hearing us thank you for uh the direction that you you've taken us uh based on our our feedback a few months ago I I thank you for that um very much so now we're on to item 5B and we need a motion on that one to get started councilor Nordic do you have a motion for us question number 2023-2 authorizing a transfer of Appropriations within the city's fiscal year 2023 budget for the cost of new airport related staff and terminal Improvement costs and the addition of 9.0 FTE to accommodate Commercial Air Service second counselor to your motion thank you so I have heard from everyone tonight including the Air Services most toughest critics and I want to continue hearing from those who oppose Air Service moving forward because we need you at the table we need those who are steadfast steadfastly dedicated to the environment to continue to show up and tell us how we can do everything we can to minimize the carbon footprint from moving forward with Air Service and I also encourage folks that we heard from a variety of perspectives because there's so many different assumptions some folks say well I would never use their service so therefore we don't need it there are some folks who may have some very different points of view on whether there will be benefits to everyone in Salem or just a certain demographic but in listening to all those assumptions I'm really struck by the fact that this will be a huge Boon to our economy to our entire region to our diverse communities here and that I see ways for us to accomplish this and help move our city into uh its next phase as Council as as mayor Hoy so what I want to really again emphasize to all of you who testified in opposition tonight I hear you and I see you on this and I want us to work together on that whether it's through carbon offsets or perhaps setting up an advisory Council in the future to continue to weigh in on the carbon impact of our airport perhaps there are other ways we can offset it through more solar through more tree plantings more ways to sequester carbon I want us to come together at this table rather than be divided over the future of an airport and I feel that we are ready for it after listening to the Consultants of the city hired the private Consultants at other groups hired I've listened very thoughtfully to everything here but I again want to say to all of the naysayers this evening I want you to continue to show up to the meetings and let us know how we can move forward with this if we in fact do choose to move forward with it how can we become a Green Airport how can we ensure that low-income folks can take advantage of this airport and receive public transportation to and from so for all these reasons I will be voting yes in favor of this motion thank you counselor other comments counselor nishioka thank you mayor Hoy I agree with Vanessa um counselor Nordic excuse me um I I want to thank everyone that came to speak it is not easy it is intimidating to come it's difficult to write thorough emails that people sent us with passion and I too want to hear from those that are in opposition through whatever decision we make because they are important an important voice as well and I also want to continue to hear from those that",

qualifications in reducing reusing and recycling of products so this gives us a greater flexibility in seeking out qualifications um it it has allowed a history of also having our residents work on some of these projects which is very valuable to us we've actually seen one of our um past projects that was just completed in the last year where a uh sthare res was able to work on yakona Hall and receive Bly commercial wage rates in the process so um I'm here to answer any additional questions thank you so much all right we have nobody signed up for public comment on this public hearing but I am open for answering questions here or not me Lord Nicole commissioner so I had just a couple of questions and and you may have said that in your presentation so if you did I I apologize I missed it but both of these projects are um serving the elderly and disabled and so where do they go while the properties are being renovated thank you um that's a great question we do um we do seek out proposals for working with collaborative Partners typically hotels I can tell you that uh the last time was Robert Lindsay Tower and our seniors really enjoyed their 30 day vacation away from us in fact they wanted me to deliver cookies every night at 8:00 p.m. so um we do really work on finding a great alternative location which are usually Extended Stay locations with similar amenities except for they usually have a pool and cookies and food and other items that we can't so we do try to make it very fun um and we do provide all the moving and expenses so this is at no cost to our res we pay for all moving fees related to the uniform act yeah please um and how long did do you expect the renovations to take for each of these projects like how long will they be displaced is what I'm curious about that's a really great question on why we would like to get a cgmc on board so that they can help us decipher how long that timeline looks or appear years to be which allows us then to plan and budget for also the relocation expenses and making sure that we can find suitable locations during um we we actually were going to address these projects a couple years ago um but during the covid-19 crisis that wasn't feasible for us to make sure that they could safely be Hotel um so we have started this process back up um and now there is also a a shovel ready requirement for for applications with Oregon Housing and Community Services so it's very imperative that we have all those answers our goal is to try to keep them um but get them back into their units within 30 to 45 days um some uh Renovations such as Ada take are more extensive and can take up to 90 days out of their unit great any other questions yes commissioner Hoy thank you um if you do start the cookie program I might want to move in thank you I thought I was going to have to there for a while all right any other yes commissioner nordik sure just something I wanted to highlight for the record when I go online to look at what South View Terrace looks at for example the current monthly rent is a flot rate of $600 to $650 a month and I'm sure there's a wait list for that property correct that's correct the maximum income limit is $37,800 60 for one person or 43,2 60 for two persons and you have had no shortage of people who can meet those limitations for that apartment unit that's correct similarly for Englewood Englewood also has strict maximum income 31550 for one or $ 36,50 for two people and again you've had no problem finding people who can meet those requirements for that one either yes that's correct okay I think this just helps demonstrate how sore the need is for affordable housing for our low-income seniors is there anything else you'd like to add the only thing that I would like to say is that a good majority of our seniors are living off of Social Security and average monthly rent or average payment to them is anywhere from 914 to a little bit over 12200 some do have a little bit more and then a very few have some uh small pensions from previous past years and um it's very imperative to have affordable housing for them right now thank you all right if there are no yep commissioner Hoy just adding uh and that population is growing is that correct that's our greatest I think our fastest growing population in the Salem area that's not our fastest growing waiting list right now but it is definitely there's still need thank you thank you so much yes commissioner nishioka thank you um Nicole thank you I again every time you present I'm always so um impressed with what you and your team are able to achieve so thank you again I live very close to the uh one on Fairview and when going by it looks like a wonderful place to live and I see many people um taking walks and many of them have their pets so that was one question I was going to ask are they able to take their pets to the transitional um property while they're waiting absolutely we make sure that any either reasonable accommodations or whatever is needed additional deposits are paid thank you and it is such a great place because there's um grocery shops there's stores there's places to eat um affordable places to eat all within walking distance and also um a Transit line so this the the one on Fair View is a remarkably wonderful place for those that have been able to live there so I think it's great and I congratulate you on that and I also applaud the use of recycling reuse for any materials that you can that's important and again thank you great all wonderful questions thank you if we are ready I will close the hearing okay and we are open for deliberation we need a motion from a vice chair I move that we adopt 2303 approving an exemption from the competitive bidding process and the use of CM GC Services for a class of public Improvement contracts for the construction of affordable housing property I'll second that great thank you moved by commissioner Phillips seconded by commissioner nishioka would you like to speak to your motion briefly yeah I mean I think it's it's obvious that there's a tremendous need for affordable housing in Salem uh it's been a desired goal for years if not decades um and currently the the Housing Authority uh City of Salem um is working on two new affordable uh housing projects uh the first is redovas of Ingle one uh West apartments and the second is the project of South viw Terrace Apartments um I think that this is just adding to our inventory that we're desperately behind on and it's not just like affordable housing like to say it it's defined uh affordable housing so it makes a tremendous difference and I'm just uh you know I I cannot stress enough how amazing it is to work with Nicole and the entire salum Housing Authority um the work that you do is tremendous I I've only heard that you are the top of the class in terms of like our region so it's a pleasure to work with you and I'm happy to support and this isn't all you guys are up to right no never all right any other yes commissioner Hoy um Nicole you made a distinction that I think I'm curious about now you said that's not your fastest growing waiting list in in terms of the elderly um what what is so that's a really common question that I get it's very difficult to answer I I want to see there is a lot of Need for affordable housing on our seniors but there's also a gap in Need for Medicaid assisted facilities for our seniors and um we there there's a differentiation of when we really work hard to keep all our seniors living and aging in place at home but there's been more and more turnover recently that they need more higher level of care than we can provide at the Housing Authority so yes affordable housing comes in a lot of varieties and I think there's a lot of need and probably um gr and Bennett can adapt this as well we really struggle to find Medicaid assisted senior housing that provides an additional care um because we're Independent Living we have no no cookies at night no meals being delivered no medication that can be um delivered it is not my fastest growing waiting list but that's not to say the need isn't there as well we we we haven't had a need to open these waiting lists very often so it could very well open and have a high um context on it I will say that single individuals between the ages of 30 and 50 or 60 is a really growing population that we're seeing that's just not quite making it um due to either their retirements or Social Security payments that they receive also our younger families is our probably our fastest growing waiting list they can work two and three jobs trying to make in me and still not be able to pay for child care car insurance and all the multiple bills that come on top of renting a place and if you don't have rent assistance and the average rents are getting upwards of 1,800 to 2200 a month um without affordable housing they're doubling up and couch surfing more and more wow thank you for looking out for so many thank you all right if there are no other comments I will ask the recorder to please call the RO commissioner Gwyn I commissioner Gonzalez hi commissioner Hoy I commissioner nordik I commissioner",

        "text": " I talked about about the proposed facility about the notice of intent and all of that information will get summarized in what Odo prepares which is the next step which is the project order and the project order is something I will prepare as the signing analyst and gets reviewed and approved through our department and we prepared that project order for the purposes of giving it back to the applicant and that project order will contain really specific information about what needs to be included in their preliminary application so the applicant will be working on the materials for preliminary application and they will submit a preliminary application should they choose to um based upon what they're required to submit and it will be in the project order and that project order is underway and it will be issued in the middle of June is the deadline to to issue that to the applicant and then it come starts the application process so the first step is a preliminary application the applicant submits to the perment a preliminary application with all of the required exhibits that cover all of the 16 standards that we have and we as a department have to review that for completeness it has to have sufficient and adequate information for Council to really reach a conclusion on whether or not a standard is met um we also issue another public notice that says we've received a preliminary application it gets updated on the web page we will also an an informational meeting then and open it up for comment and then we go back to those reviewing agencies and coordinate pardon no com oh no comment okay I'm sorry public notice information meeting not on the preliminary okay and then the agency coordination is ongoing throughout so we're going to consult once we've deemed it complete that's what we call an ASC it's the full complete application and we can move forward with drafting the draft proposed order which is the next step so the department will prepare a draft proposed order once it's issued we issue notice we post it on the public website we have a public hearing the public hearing will be an opportunity for the public to participate and and make comments on the record for the application and that makes that's important to know because it ties to the contested case so in order order to participate in a contested case you need to make comments at the draft proposed order public hearing stage before that public comment period closes on the draft proposed order once we're done with that we take all of those comments and we incorporate that information we may make revisions and we issue what is called a proposed order both times Council will review we'll take the draft proposed order for Council review we'll make edits changes revisions as recommended by Council or in response to comments and we'll issue a proposed order that proposed order will be issued by the department along with another public notice it is not open for public comment at this time but that notice will also include the notice of contested case so it's your opportunity at that point to request a contested case once the proposed order is issued that notice goes out that notice on the contested case goes out you can ask as to participate in that contested case and then at the very end is the final Order final decision by the energy facility sighting Council so council is involved in all of these stages but the decision is ultimately theirs and they make that decision on whether to issue or you know I don't know what the other issue options would be amend amend okay a they'll approve a final order we will issue that final order the chair will then sign a site certificate and the site certificate will be granted I know you have a question we can go back to this later on we can come back to this slide when we open Q&amp;A okay so next slid so I did talk a little bit about reviewing agencies and special advisory groups and and their role I think that the important thing to realize is you know the the special Advisory Group for this facility is Wasco County because they are the local government um and they've been appointed as the special Advisory Group the other reviewing agencies also have the opportunity to make recommendations one of the key things that we look for is the description of the analysis area what areas need to be included in the application review and part of that is to identify the studies that may need to be conducted any local ordinances or or local government and other administrative rules that might need to be considered in the application and included and also identification of any required permits that might be required of the applicant in order to move forward with the so I mentioned that we are a standards based project process and this slide shows our 16 citing standards it is the burden of proof of the applicant applicant to demonstrate that on the record they can meet each standard it is the Department's role to evaluate that evidence because we're an evidentiary process and to consider are all the comments received and determine whether or not the applicant has demonstrated that they can meet that standard and then we make those recommendations to the FC the council who will evaluate all that making their decision because we are at the notice of intent phase we are seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to revise or provide but it's important if you do want to participate and comment in our that comments realize we are a standards based Pro process these standards apply to facilities we have um more literature on the table over there if you want to learn more about these but these are the things that Council has to consider with each of these standards when they consider whether or not to issue or deny or remand back an application for a site certificate okay and in the notice of intent we have mandatory study area distances that are that tie to these standards and one of the things that we're Consulting on is whether these need to be made bigger smaller um based upon potential resources or concerns that reviewing agencies or the public may have or our special Advisory Group so each stand has its own kind of extent of what that study area is this is for what had to be included in the notice of intent in the project order these may change they might get bigger they might get smaller based upon available information but it just gives you an overview of kind of like how we look at the site boundary the the resources and standards that we consider um around that site boundary as we ask the applicant to prepare information to submit in their preliminary application okay next slide so as I noted before the state sighting process is Consolidated review that pulls most permits standards and requirements from local governments and state agencies into one process and so for land use the applicant has the option to have the land use review either be conducted by the local government which would be Bosco County or to have Consolidated into our state review and the notice of intent the applicant has indicated they want to consolidate it within the state review at the time they submit their application they have to commit they can pick one or the other but they can't change it once they've picked it in the application and the land just as a consideration um for this one the land within the proposed site boundary is all zoned A1 efu land it's nonirrigated um and is currently used for growing winter wheat and and grazing just if people were interested okay next step next slide so really quickly and then I'm going to turn it over to the applicant team the notice of inted is applying for a new new site certificate a site certificate for a new proposed facility it is going to have a 2011 megawatt name plate capacity at the point of interconnection which is where it connects with the the transmission line um and it's going to be cited on 4,061 acres here in Wasco County it will have a wind generating component it will also have a solar generating component and the solar array will be approximately 274 Acres within a 474 acre fence solar area they're proposing approximately 32 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 648 ft next slide there are also related or supporting facilities that are proposed in the notice of intent includes a battery storage what we call a best on would occupy up to 10 acres and it would store up to 201 megawatts of energy there are other facility components such as a switching station a collector substation I pointed at the point of interconnect is intended or proposed to be with the Bonville power uh void Ridge switchyard there will be above and below ground uh 34.5 kilovolt collection there will be a 10,000 ft\u00b2 o&amp;m building and 8 miles of approximately 8 miles of 230 KV overhead transmission line and some new access roads 10.2 some Road improvements of approximately 13 miles um another set of staging areas and temporary batch plant those staging areas are primarily for construction purposes and I believe that is my last slide and I am going to turn it over to the applicant team to present more on the actual proposed facility and then we will when they're done we'll go right into public comment do you have their slides okay it's all you okay just to be clear you're GNA double back to the public comment slide that preceded this okay thank you um so thanks again folks again samfield and I head up the development team at IPA power IPA power is um what in the industry is called a independent power producer which means that we uh originate or initiate develop build own and operate renewable generation and battery storage facilities um ipop power was uh founded in 2017 under a different name it was acquired by Blackstone one of the largest uh asset owners across real estate energy and and other Industries globally uh in in 2020 um and we have been developing utility scale uh again battery storage wind and solar energy facilities and and hybridizations of those different Technologies uh across North America since that time uh we're currently 114 uh people strong or heading headquarters are in Austin Texas and uh I'm based in in Portland uh Matt who I'll turn it over to in a in a minute um is based in Idaho um but our sort of majority headcount sits sits in Austin uh IPA is a very credible developer owner and operator of these types of facilities um most of our team came from other independent power producers and have been working in this space for 20 plus years um we're currently operating uh 150 megawatts in Texas we're under construction on another 150 megawatts in Texas 100 megawatts in Los Angeles and California uh and then we",

        "text": " citing division are necessary just and reasonable so we bring this request to you as we are going outside of the sighting division to make you know to be transparent and to make sure that you agree and I'll give you a little bit more context about scope and costs here in just a few um so for a little more background the sighting division has an ongoing request for proposal process it is on a five-year cycle where we send out requests for um uh is that called a request for proposal we send out a request for a proposal for consultant a technical environmental consultant support and the most recent cycle was in 2020 and as a result of that process we issue a master Services agreement and then under that Master Services agreement we would then come to council and get authorization for work order contracts so in 2020 the RFP the request for proposal awarded a master Services contract to Haley and Aldrich and then with that two sub-consultants were approved along with Haley and Aldrich which is Golder and historic resources Associates so I'm going to call them h array and they are a specialized consultant for cultural resource review uh we have come to council a few times before very recently for this type of request in December 2020 I came to you with a request to use HRA for six projects that were in the queue at that to address specific issues and availability and resources that were being experienced by our sister agency the state historic preservation office three years later we still have the same issue and the same needs what we're experiencing is that archaeological and a built environment reports are submitted to shippo for review for our f-sec process and Nothing results or even having issues doing our normal coordination communication we send emails we make phone calls that's our normal process we request to schedule meetings and they're simply not to support our need so from our perspective this puts both siding staff and council at risk we don't have a subject matter expert that's reviewing our work and helping us review the consult or the applicant or certificate holders work so we are here today to request that Council approve the execution of work order contracts through Haley and Aldrich for HRA on current projects in the queue including loan time to Whetstone transmission line Cascade renewable transmission line Summit Ridge Wind Farm Amendment 6 Muddy Creek energy Park and Wheat Ridge or Noble energy facility requests three requests for Amendment one the work order contracts that we would be proposing to execute are equivalent and budget to our intergovernmental agreement with shippo so not to exceed ten thousand of course it can be more than that if needed based on specific uh issues but that would be our starting point as a quick reference point when we came to you in 2020 and you approved that request there were six projects in the queue we proceeded or moved forward with three work order contracts and those completed work on average of six thousand dollars so we're not we're not blowing our budgets there um so the work order contracts that we're proposing would pass such as reviewing materials for applications and amendments that are related to the historic cultural and archaeological resources standard specifically we would we may ask I mean that lead analysts can kind of decide what the scope needs to be but it would be support in evaluating the studies that have been done the evaluation of resources the methods that have been used and then once you move through that evaluate the adequacy of avoidance and mitigation measures and then reviewing of the department staff work is are there recommendations adequate valid and those are the typical types of tasks we would ask of shippo that we are not able to get completed at this time so with that I will hand it over to council for deliberation are there any questions for Sarah at this time Vice chair Hal the list that you gave up Lone Pine Whetstone Cascade Summit Ridge Wheat Ridge and muddy creek and so forth you said including but it's not limited to those well our process has been for it to be Project Specific so those are all the projects in the queue right now those are all the projects we have under review that don't already have prior Council approval from that December 2020. I'm just wondering if there's a chance something might come up well there is in addition to and would they be able to be used then or would well I think that our request if you approve it for a project it's all fsec proceedings related to that project so future amendments would be rolled in what it doesn't cover is projects we don't have right now so if I don't know if there's space to review or to seek yeah so I'll jump in for the record Todd um in December 2020 was that the last um there was some concern by Council that we don't do this as a permanent thing so at that time that's why it was limited to those specific projects that's also why we built in these specific projects so including but it's not but not limited to it is just that was our intent was just these and then if we had additional requests we would add those at a future council meeting I I don't believe there's any limitation of you doing this you know on a kind of a project by project basis or a Time um you know I think that's your call to make but again we were sort of following the direction from the last time we brought this to council I guess this is Ken I guess I was thinking last time that that was maybe an exception to the rule or it seems like that there's a pattern this is going to continue uh it's kind of the so I'm wondering should it be are we limiting ourselves so that it's going to make more work for having come back and what kind of thing so I'm just throwing that out there yeah I mean it could be we could come back on a yearly basis and reset it and just build it into you know every January or every December you know in the not be Project Specific but we would sort of reset it um you you could give us the discretion to decide when when we use it I mean really I think it's all over the kind of the board as to how you want to go it's more about your comfort level I think than ours um about this so our you know our system is designed for us to work with state um you know they are a reviewing agency we're required to provide notification we will continue to do that it's really your comfort level about our use of a consultant in this and and we we don't intend certainly to cut out the state of sort preservation office we would rather rely upon them um because that's how it's designated they just haven't had the capacity don't currently have the capacity and for the foreseeable future don't look like they will have the capacity either to be able to timely review and comment on on our council member Condon uh thanks um just curious does the process require uh the request and the request of the agency before you engage a consultant like for does it have to be an affirmative no we can't do it or from shippo the shippo have to not not chippo the statute kind of related to this essentially says if a reviewing agency is unable to comment within the time frame that's required that they can hire a consultant to conduct the work for them it doesn't practically work very well because by the time we send them the notice you know and then they don't respond we're already running behind so we've done this in a preemptive way I think it still meets the the the purpose intent of the statute but it's not in this case shippo or parks department doing it it's we're doing it on on their behalf with their full knowledge and understanding and agreement I might add as well um so yeah I think the way the statute is written sort of would do it on a case-by-case basis but that practically doesn't work and I would just offer um the like the rules require the lead analysts to send review requests and we would still attempt that coordination and so this is a backstop and because Contracting could take three months you know it's just we're just getting it in place I think we're gonna need it but if not because the above ground resources is a different group than archeology so it could be a hybrid and it's it's insurance if we need it so thank you for the record this is uh Marci Grill I I am not a pessimist however I'm a realist and I think anything we can do to not have a built-in delay is going to benefit all parties involved and um I'm in favor I I think having it specific it's great and obviously if you need something different than someone's going to bring it to the council and we'll address it at that time but at minimum I mean we've just went through this a couple years ago that seemingly got us to this I don't think we should try to build anything hard I think we should see what occurs but I think the intent is that we don't allow something that we know we must have to stop progress any further comments questions Vice chair how okay you anticipating please uh so if there are none then this is an action item uh and I would ask if anyone is prepared to make a motion Madam chair I move that the inter well let's see that the uh improve well I move approval of the Department's use of consultants for review of exhibit s for the Lone Pine to Whetstone Cascade renewable transmission line and Muddy Creek energy Park projects as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair how I I hear a second from council member Devlin and oh we modify the list of projects okay so you said you said muddy creek and uh Lone Pine did you say Cascade renewable yes at Redstone so I think I need to add uh I think just Summit Ridge wind farm and we return Noble energy facility three yeah so I'll I'll add Summit Ridge Wind Farm Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility and I'm kind of thinking should as a pre-amble to those listings should I say including but not limited to okay I'll I'm gonna throw that in um and we'll see if we get a second okay so uh Vice chair how has added the including but not limited to is there a second or does anyone have any comments about that we're here a second for the comment uh Vice excuse me councilmember Conan looks like she wishes to say something thank you um just a quick so that leaves it pretty open-ended for dollars and it's is that dollars there's still 10 pounds",

at the desk back there with her not only does she have the computer to sign up for notices she also has a paper comment form if you wish to speak tonight in public comment period we ask that you get one of those so that we can call you up by name and have the information of your name and address so we can follow up with you in the comments um you can also provide comments through our online comment portal the information is in the notice and we will have a microphone open for public comment after the presentations are are finished just some general housekeeping that I wanted to start with is we have restrooms across to the left outside the door and most importantly the emergency exits for this room are out the hallway to the rights there's an emergency exit door should we have to evacuate the building for any reason um so I just want to make sure everybody understands that we also have in the room the project proponents the Pacific Power team geninello is in the back he will also be speaking later tonight and he can introduce the rest of his team when that opportunity arises so I just wanted again to thank everybody and we have people online that are participating that this meeting is for the public it is to engage the public it is to provide you with an information on a notice of from Pacific Power to apply for a site certificate they have not submitted an application yet this is the initial stage and so in part of our process for this citing division is we hold a public informational meeting in the area affected by the proposed project and that's why we are here from the Department of energy and this is our meeting we're hosting it for our process specific power here is here as the applicant the project proponent as a part of the requirements of our noticeable Texas so when we get we get presentation part we will present Sarah and I on the energy facility citing process the citing process that a state certificate that falls in our jurisdiction goes through and then we'll hand it over to the applicant who will give you more information on the proposed project and then we'll have the Q a in comment so like I said national meeting it's to give you an opportunity to get information and give us feedback and also we're asking that you can hold your comments and your questions until that to the comment period it's important that everybody be respectful so we just ask that people speak with respect and behave accordingly and we have a lot of material to cover but uh process should be uh beneficial to you if you have participated and come in so just some background on the application that we have received on April 27th of this year we received the notice of intent submitted by Pacific Power and that is to um it's the very first step in our process like I said and that initiated our issuing the public notice issuing it in the paper mailing it to proper affected property owners and scheduling this fee it's like everyone so I want to give you a little video about the energy facility setting program and the energy facility citing the energy facility setting Council are the decision makers oversight certificates while under their they are a seven person body they are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate they represent a diverse array of areas and backgrounds we currently have seven members or all the positions are built and they are the on anything that falls in their jurisdiction that has to go through our we Sarah and I and Nancy hatch who's also here is our administrative assistant in Erica we work for the Department of energy and we work in the citing Division and we are the technical support staff to the energy facility citing Council so we're charged with doing environmental review for an evidentiary based process so applicants and components of projects that have to get a site certificate from the stadium have to feed the information to us that we have to analyze and review and we make recommendations to our Council based status There are 16 General standards of review that I'll get to in another slide and we're Consolidated process so it allows an applicant to kind of funnel all of their other requirements for permits and the idea is to reduce redundancies in the permitting process and a site certificate from the citing council is ultimately a formative to sight and energy facility based upon their next slide so what types of facilities fall under the upside exciting process it needs to be a state jurisdictional energy facility that meets the definition under our Oregon statutes 469 300 subpart 11. and these are a list of the types of facilities that fall under jurisdiction so we've highlighted that this is a high voltage transmission line and that is an energy facility that has fallen under console jurisdiction next one so a little bit more about the transmission line in order for it to to require a site certificate from our Council and has to check these three boxes needs to be greater than 10 miles in length it needs to be greater or equal to 230 kilovolt capacity and it needs to cross one more more than one jurisdiction and because this proposed transmission line checks all three boxes it requires that the applicant the proponent get a site certificate from the state through the energy facility citing next slide so as I mentioned earlier we have standards of review that we as deciding division have to evaluate every proposal that comes to us to make sure that the applicant or the proponent has the ability to meet the requirements of each of these standards so we have 16 standards there are some that are specific to transmission lines and we as the citing division staff this is a lot of what we do is we put these projects through this evidentiary review process to confirm whether or not these proposed projects can actually need these standards and then we make recommendations to council um the burden of proof to show whether or not your project meets in all of these 16 standards is the applicants so they need to submit to us adequate and sufficient information that would demonstrate that they have done their adequate environmental review and planning to design a project that can meet these and since we're in the notice of intent stage we're really seeking input that from the public on anything that you might want to provide based upon the information that we have right now but there's more to our process and it's really important to understand where it's step one we're at the notice of intent stage next slide so in this traffic I think is really helpful because it shows our process like in a in a schematic and as the red box will show you we're at the beginning we're at the notice of intent phase and one of the things that I really wanted to highlight is the boxes in green or every phase of our project a process that really provide for and encourage public participation and input so at the notice of intent stage you have an opportunity to provide input if the applicant decides or the proponent decides to submit a full application for a site certificate you will again have an opportunity to provide input and permit where we encourage our public participation in our process it's very important to our Council because that helps inform them and they are the ultimate deciders it helps them make a good decision so in this scheme We have basically seven steps and I'm going to go through them really quickly but after a notice of intent is issued we hold a public meeting we provide a comment period on that notice of intent with the information that was included in it and we have a comment period that comment period for this notice notice of intent is open until July 7th so you can comment anytime on the notice of intent up until that time and we take all the information that we get from input at the notice of intense phase from our reviewing agencies we have to coordinate with tribes and other state agencies who review The Proposal as well and give us comments back on what they think about it we can file all that information and we issue our project order and then that project order is basically a punch list of the requirements for the project proponent to that they have to include in their application should they choose to submit an application they will submit a preliminary application and in that you the department will go through and make sure that they're that it's complete and that it has sufficient information to determine whether or not each of these standards are met and there's a little back and forth that goes between us and the applicant to get it to what we call once we have a complete application we issue another notice we post it on the website and again there's a public comment period on the formal application we will then review all that information and prepare what is called a draft proposed order and that is a fairly technical document that summarizes each of those 16 standards I mentioned and our evaluation of that and we give recommendations to our Council of whether or not we think that there are either conditions that need to be prescriptive kind of conditions to meet the standard or if the standard has been done but there are recommendations and we take that to our Council the council reviews it we have a public hearing and when we have the public hearing we'll be back down here to have it and we take all of that comment from our Council from the public from the reviewing agencies and we have to basically issue a revised document which is a proposed order and then that proposed order",

        "text": " tax deferral or abatement program that you have used taken advantage of we're the only County I believe still to this day that is implemented that and uh you know our Economic Development staff and pre even previous staff worked really hard to get that and it's you know great place to open and develop a business and that one thing is is so good to offer to our existing businesses to say we want you to stay here and it also is another tool for to attract maybe somebody that's looking for a larger space or to move uh so thank you for being uh the facilitator of that the convenor of that appreciate it well we appreciate your leadership in having that on the books because it's uh I know we I know we have to uh we've seen tens of millions of dollars of investment in rural Maran County as a result of that yeah yeah t and some of those some of those are now paying property taxes they weren't before so yeah just after three years they out tax rols initially I thought it was a great idea to try to get our peer counties to do the same thing but selfishly I decided that's a bad idea because I want all the people to come to marry County so they've missed out now I'm not going to help them well and when you think of a company you know like um sodbusters I mean you know they're growing they're growing hops but now thanks to you know this program they were able to uh expand their hops drying capacities and add value to the product that they're you know making there and selling around the world so um you know I just love this for the value added agriculture opportunities too I mean we've got other companies that taken advantage of it but that's that's such a nice offering to be able to do for a county that has such a strong agriculture backbone and and I'll never I'll never forget um W Valley Vineyards had uh expanded I think they put $6 million into it and Jim berau calls me and says I need you to have lunch cuz he had his property tax statement and he he's going I my proper prop taxes just went up and we haven't even started yet and that was the start of that whole thing many years ago so great appreciate it welcome thank you just as an afterthought to the construction Alliance desire to be a participant um Kevin you might want to get them connected with our future Parks plan thinking about some of the major projects yeah you know that's a that's a great idea with with our new our new uh Parks director Kevin his name's Kevin I'm trying to think of his last name can anybody remember his last name anyways I'll get you connected okay good with him and they're going to have a lot of projects it's a great idea we have some really like um stateof thee art Concepts yeah that potentially well they'll be need construction and I think it'd be a great Community effort similar to that Community Center but a a focal point that we've talked to some of our partners such as fers about oh that's great what what it would look like for them to engage and I think it would be fun for the alliance to I think they would enjoy it th we can invite Kevin into our meeting and Kevin Thompson um and you can kind of talk about what the plan is and where there may be some opportunity for him yeah that'd be great okay hey thank you for being here thanks for the work you do for your time nice to see you appreciate all those businesses you support that um pay property taxes so that we can give services to the people of maring County you know um wait Eric one one more thing has he have you seen this the um research we did on were you in the meeting when we had the research presented to us on what businesses mean I don't think so we need to follow Economic Development impact studyed it we need to follow up with that and have a meeting so that that you could share that you know I know you already know it anecdotally but we actually had some multiplying factors Etc what a business does to um subsidize basically the services in Maran County based on the property taxes instead of raising taxes What do businesses contribute to balance out the cost of the system yeah adding more businesses and you think of a place like Wilsonville that has all these businesses there right people IM migrate whatever for the day but they get all those property taxes yeah not that we're trying to be like Wilsonville well but we have opportun we have opportunities in different ways yeah yeah no we'd be happy to learn more about that and get that out that information out too I think it' be a great presentation at some point yeah with said Corp members to like actually help them understand what their contributions look like be a great presentation at a board meeting MH absolutely Kelly would be yeah thank you you okay um

for the record I'm Kelly whis the economic development program manager here at Fan County and I am super pleased to bring to you our new proposed economic development program strategic plan so this plan is intended to set guidance for the program's mission and goals and objectives and our highlevel strategy for the next 5 years so we're planning for fiscal years 25 to 29 with this new strategic plan in July we hired better City to assist the county in the development of the new plan better City works with local governments throughout the country to develop strategic plans feasibility studies and project implementation services so I'm really pleased to introduce Eric Gibson he's a director at better City and he's going to be leading us through today's presentation thank you very much Kelly and good morning Commissioners just introduce yourself for the record yeah so my name is Eric Gibson I work at better City it's an economic development advisory firm I've been working at that company for about 7even years and I've been very grateful this is my second time working actually with the County we worked previously with Detroit Detroit and Gates uh for some of their uh Redevelopment and uh Community visioning post fire and post pandemic so really grateful for the opportunity to work with the county again this plan has been a a multi-month engagement and we're we're really pleased uh with the outcome of it we we started the process uh as Kelly mentioned in the summer and we we began by looking at past plans not only of the County's plans but also so many of the Cities throughout the county uh looked at the data for the county as well as individual communities and then started uh a Sur survey period for both the public as well as elected officials and that gave an opportunity for us to to work with stakeholders to work with the public and really understand what the cities were wanting what the public was interested in in terms of Economic Development and the outcomes of that was shared in a memo that we gave to to the board in November we we then began drafting the plan and shared it with stakeholders as well as uh with with the board and and opened it to public review we did receive some some feedback in that and have addressed those items and we're we're happy now today to have uh the final plan for you to to look at and approve in terms of the public Outreach we really focused on the stakeholders who are engaged in the economic development ecosystem and we worked with those Partners sore included the workforce board the colleges and universities as well as the Chambers of Commerce um we also met with a lot of the the Commissioners and the employees at the county in order to understand what the program's role is uh within the county as well as that larger Economic Development ecosystem and then really understanding what the the communities themselves were looking at those staff members and what they were trying to do and Kelly took the lead in in meeting with a lot of the city councils and City staff members in order to understand what their projects and needs were and their priorities you can see on this right hand side the feedback that was received there are three three main things first is the the the actual role of the economic development program needed to be better refined and and publicized and and shared with those Partners so that they could understand exactly what the role was of the program and how it interacted with the partners second was a few needs um that we identified throughout the county that were common throughout the communities as well as for at the county at large and then finally uh a potential growth area which is value added Agriculture and looking at adopting better technology Innovations to really enhance that sector and and increase the wages employees So",

        "text": "good afternoon everyone just want to do a sound check jen or stacey can you hear i'm good great super well um good afternoon my name is janine benner i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and um i see we've still got some people joining the call so i'll give folks just a few more minutes to sign on and we will get started in just a moment thanks for being here all right well we're three minutes past the hour so i think we can probably go ahead and get started um welcome everyone to this oregon department of energy webinar where we'll be sharing information about the energy-related provisions of the infrastructure investment and jobs act and seeking information from you as to how we can best shape our efforts to direct those resources to benefit my name is janine benner i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and i really appreciate you for joining today very soon i will be turning this over to jen center who is our federal grants coordinator to lead the conversation and i'm also introduced excuse me i'm also joined by a few additional odo staff today and i will ask them to introduce themselves in the chat and actually i'd welcome all of the attendees in our meeting today to introduce yourselves in the chat as well with your name and if you're representing any particular organization we'd love to know who's with us on the call today so i want to start off by acknowledging that many of you likely have questions about the funding the timing and whether or not a specific project that you are thinking about might be eligible under the funding streams that we'll discuss today uh i'll just be upfront and say at this we also have many questions and as we through the presentation um we hope that you will use the chat feature to ask any questions you might have we may not have the answer to everything yet and we may not have time to answer every question live today but we are going to gather your questions and respond on our website in the weeks following this presentation because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance which is um great we have everyone muted currently but as we go through the presentation we'll pause for questions and at that point we'll be able to unmute individuals to ask questions when they raise their as we go through the presentation we'll also be using some new polling features for real time and in addition to responding during this webinar you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up if you'd like more time and more space to respond or if you want more time to consider your responses or if you want to share that with other people who you also think would be interested in providing feedback and i'm going to ask my colleague richie to put the link to that portal in the chat um jen can i have the next slide please oh there you go this is uh our agenda for today an overview of the presentation that we'll be sharing um starting with some information about our agency some background on the infrastructure investment and jobs act including highlights of the energy related we'll then cover the community engagement work we've done so far and what lies ahead in our planning process and towards the end we have some specific opportunities for you to provide input and feedback and we'll also cover how we intend to use the information that we gather today through this and through this process and the presentation materials are posted on our website now and we're also recording this webinar all right so before we dive in for those of you who are new to webex just a quick guide on how to use some of the features as i mentioned before your unmute button and video buttons won't work but our host will be able to unmute you if we call on you to ask a question you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen and under the excuse me the right-hand side of your screen under the participants panel if you click near your name and there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar and also feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make as you're doing that go ahead and send if you have the option to all panelists or everyone so that the odo staff can see it and help respond and we will try to get to as many of those questions in the chat and through raised hands but again we may not have time for all of that today um you may notice that there's also a q a function or that that might be an option or you might see please don't use that we won't be monitoring that and one more thing to highlight that's not on the slide there on the right side of your screen where you see participants and chat every once in a while there will be a poll that pops up and it will have the title slido on it at that point we'll we'll let you know it's coming and we hope you will participate by checking a little circle and entering a response and then don't forget to press the green send button when you enter your response so it's actually submitted to us okay one more thing to mention um is that if you are calling in on the phone you can press once we unmute you you can press star six to unmute yourself and then i think you press star to raise your hand and please bear with us uh as we try to keep track of all the questions and comments coming in okay so one more thing before we jump in a quick introduction to the oregon department of energy or photo as you might hear is referred to on this slide you see our vision our mission and what we do and our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape and equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future under what we do on this slide you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve that mission and today we'll be discussing how federal funding opportunities can support our mission and our work for example we know that funding under the federal state energy program can support oregon updates to our energy security plan which will inform efforts to strengthen energy systems in our state and mitigate impacts from disasters next slide please all right our purpose today is twofold first we want to share what we know about federal funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act and second we want to seek your input as to how odo should approach these funding based on the input we receive we'll be building statements of guiding priorities which will help us shape our use of formula grants and choose which competitive grants may be the most beneficial for odo to pursue so we are going to start by asking you a question this is going to be our first polling question so that we can gauge your level of awareness on these topics as well as your assessment of your current capacity as of today so we're going to start off with a poll to get a better sense of our audience it should be there on the right hand side of your screen right now the uh will give everyone 45 seconds or a minute to figure this out and and make your selection and don't forget after you've made your selection to press send so you may actually have to scroll down on your um and stacy i'm seeing that it says voting closed so i don't know if it's possible to reopen that there we go um for those of you on the phone i'm sorry we don't have an option to take the poll over the phone but these same questions are uh on the handout that we've provided um i guess we don't call them handouts anymore the email app that we've and in the portal on our website so this question says thinking about your organization or which of these phases or stages would you feel you identify with one haven't started and or new to this two assessing options and interests three prioritizing projects and funding four implementing projects or plans five evaluating or expanding current actually it looks like our polling is slightly different from what i just read but you can see there on your screen hopefully and it looks like we've got a good number number of respondents but let's keep it open for a little bit longer okay well it looks like responses oh no they're still coming in wait another few seconds to close it all right stacy i think the responding has slowed down so go ahead and close out that poll and i think that we will be able to see the responses okay great looks like there are a lot of people who are still assessing their options and interests which is great that's uh um good to know folks are approaching this work um and thinking about what makes sense for them and now i think i'm going to turn it over to jen to provide some background on the infrastructure investment and jobs act thank you everyone for joining us today so just to give us a little bit of a a larger context on the funding opportunities that we're talking about today the infrastructure investment and jobs act is what actually prompted this engagement here this federal law funds american infrastructure projects related roads bridges broadband internet and our energy and water systems throughout the country this was signed into law on november 15 of 2021 and the bipartisan legislation authorizes 1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending nationally and that includes 550 billion in new funding and as we go through this the biden administration is has been referring to this funding under the infrastructure law as a once in general once in a generation investment in our infrastructure systems and energy is certainly included as part of that overall investment the biden administration also has concerns about investing these federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically disadvantaged while there's many details and definitions still to be set at the federal level it does look like the biden administration intends to direct 40 of the benefits of these funds that are energy related under the infrastructure investment and jobs act disadvantaged communities and so here at odo we'll be keeping this requirement in mind as we shape up all of our relevant proposals and program and you can see some of the federal executive orders that that touch on some of these issues related to disadvantaged communities and serving those that have been historically underserved and that aligns with some state priorities because here at oda we recognize that historically there have been certain groups that have been left out of the decision-making roles when it comes to energy",

        "text": " clean energy targets but the scale of clean energy development will be substantial under every scenario there are also important considerations and trade-offs associated with different Pathways for transitioning to clean for example building more transmission would enable us to Source renewable energy from a broader geographic area or offshore which would increase access to low-cost clean energy while minimizing land use impacts in Oregon but building new transmission infrastructure can be challenging and it can take a decade or more to secure the necessary approvals to build a new line similarly deploying small scale and community-based renewable projects would deliver clean energy while also providing co-benefits like increased energy resiliency and new economic opportunities in local communities but these projects are also likely to be higher cost and larger utility scale projects and can have localized land use so given these and many other trade-offs Oregon will need to engage with stakeholders to identify an optimal Pathway to achieve the level of renewable energy build out needed while balancing these trade-offs next slide please we also need to determine what role will remain for natural gas and existing gas many studies predict that natural gas use will drop dramatically as we transition away from fossil fuels this decrease in demand for natural gas will likely be most pronounced in the building sector with some reductions in demand from the industrial sector as as the electric sector becomes increasingly reliant on renewable resources like wind and solar power many studies estimate that it will still be most cost effective to maintain some dispatchable gas capacity on the system especially to meet Peak electricity in a deeply decarbonized future this dispatchable gas capacity would increasingly depend on Lower carbon fuels like renewable hydrogen and RNG to replace fossil Natural Gas next slide please when it comes to Transportation the studies we reviewed almost universally find that a rapid transition to electric vehicles is essential for achieving decarbonization goals but transportation electrification will also create unique Equity challenges that must be addressed to eliminate barriers to EV ownership and ensure ensure Equitable access to Affordable while fuel savings are likely to be substantial The Upfront costs of purchasing an EV combined with the potential difficulties in accessing residential charging infrastructure especially for people living in multi-family buildings all present impediments to EV ownership that we need to address some studies also identify a need to develop alternative low carbon fuels for transportation modes that are hard to Electrify like rail Aviation and Marine next slide please in recent years Oregon has experienced 116 degree temperatures catastrophic wildfires and extreme drought in large portions of the state the effects and costs of climate change are increasingly being felt by oregonians and these impacts are inequitably spread across the state's technical modeling shows that Oregon can achieve its mid-century clean energy and climate goals there are multiple Pathways we can take to reach our goals and each of these Pathways has unique trade-offs for the so we have some really important choices to make what do we want our Clean Energy Future to look like and how do we want to get how can we ensure that the costs of the clean energy transition aren't disproportionately borne by communities that are already experiencing high energy burdens and how can we prevent those communities from being left behind by the energy transition how can we work with stakeholders to chart a course for organs Energy Future that's thoughtful inclusive and deliberately considers the trade-offs of the various Pathways available to us the choices we make should be guided by careful consideration and balancing of the costs benefits and other trade-offs associated with the pathways available to us we have an opportunity to develop a common understanding of the necessary scale and speed of the clean energy transition and to create an intentional strategy for building a clean energy economy that works for all oregonians but first we need to chart a course to get there next slide please so with all of this in mind we included just one recommendation in the 2022 Energy report that the state undertake a robust stakeholder driven process to craft an energy strategy for Oregon we determined that an energy strategy would help Oregon navigate these trade-offs and align public and private actions to support an intentional Equitable transition to a clean energy an energy strategy could identify Pathways to meet the state's climate and energy policy goals maintain affordability and reliability strengthen the economy and prioritize Equity while balancing trade-offs to maximize benefits and minimize Harms and now I'd like to pass it over to Edith to talk a little bit more about the Oregon energy strategy thanks a lot Amy and if we could go to the next slide um I'm Edith Bayer clean energy policy team lead at Odo thanks for the opportunity to speak today so I wanted to talk a little bit about the Oregon energy strategy um as I'm sure you know as part of the climate and energy package this recommendation that Amy just mentioned has turned into an opportunity and a directive for Odo to lead the development of an Oregon State energy strategy the relevant legislation is in house bill 3630. I should start by saying that we're very early in the process and so everything that I'm going to present today reflects an early stage of the planning and the thinking that means that I'll mainly focus on what we're being asked to do rather than the details of how we're going to do it I can say that we're in the process of planning and of Contracting Technical and facilitation experts getting this support on board will be critical for us to be able to carry out the technical analysis and to engage in robust stakeholder engagement throughout the so I'm just going to dive in and at the end of anybody has questions I'll do my best to answer them I can't promise that I or any of us will have answers but we'll do our best and we're also happy to take on questions for consideration as we move forward um and referring now to the slide um House Bill 3630 direct Odo to develop an Oregon energy strategy that identifies Pathways to achieve organs clean energy uh energy policy objectives stakeholder engagement is fundamental to the process in addition to stakeholder perfect perspectives the organ energy strategy must build on existing resource plans and studies and organs laws and policy goals the strategy also needs to account for a wide range of factors identifying Pathways forward requires evidence-based analysis to understand the costs feasibility and availability of different energy resources and Technologies as well as demand side measures that can save on resource costs and bills you'll hear some commonalities in what I'm presenting with what Amy just um the bill lists factors that Oregon must consider when identifying Pathways such as energy demands resource choices affordability environmental justice and land use considerations the energy strategy further requires identification of the benefits of different Pathways in terms of resilience new technologies and Community benefits the energy strategy must reflect the best available information and forecasts if we could move to the next slide so by November 1st 2025 we will submit a written report to the governor and legislature that includes these three main elements that you see here the first one is a summary of the energy strategy and of Pathways to achieve Oregon's policy objectives this will focus around results of the technical analysis and modeling that will help us understand and consider the different Pathways to meet Oregon's goals next there will be a description of stakeholder engagement and how we incorporated stakeholder perspectives into the energy strategy I think it's important here to be clear that stakeholder engagement lies at the core of the energy strategy and of the whole process the idea is not to come up with something over there in a closed room but rather to have a conversation and to help inform that conversation moving finally we'll develop recommendations for policy options and again stakeholder engagement will be crucial here as well uh so if we can move to the next slide to break down these sections a little bit I'll start with stakeholder engagement so the bill directs Odo to engage with state agencies federally recognized Indian tribes and stakeholders representing a diverse range of interests perspectives expertise education socioeconomic backgrounds and communities from across the state a Statewide energy strategy has to incorporate considerations from both experts and the public alike so anyone who wants to be able to participate ought to be able to with low barriers for participation we recognize this doesn't mean that everyone will agree on everything but it does mean that we're committed to a transparent process with an opportunity for all voices to be heard to ensure that Pathways that we develop incorporate priorities and concerns of all oregonians we're authorized by the bill and we will convenient convene an Advisory Group or groups to inform the development of the strategy and we're in the process of working out how that might look right next slide please so then moving on to the technical um or modeling this part will help us understand what are the costs and benefits of different Pathways or choices and to identify which Pathways have the greatest potential to achieve the state's priorities and objectives not just for energy but also for people for jobs businesses and for the environment this includes ensuring that historically underserved populations benefit from the energy transition we'll engage with stakeholders throughout this process to ensure that their views are taken into account starting with the scoping stage and ensure that there's an opportunity to input into the analysis also before it's finalized so again we really want to make sure the stakeholder engagement is something that we're actively pursuing throughout the whole technical analysis the technical analysis will be an essential input into the policy recommendations and right now as I said we're in the process of looking for a technical expert to carry out this work with us next slide please so last but certainly not least the strategy will include policy recommendations again it's not possible to go into details right now because we're in the early planning stages but I thought it would be important to mention some of the main considerations that will go into development of the policy first it's important to emphasize as with the technical analysis stakeholder engagement will be essential here relatedly we recognize that responsibility for meeting our climate and energy goals as well as expertise with existing policies and programs is shared among agencies so for this reason it will be very important to work with other state agencies to ensure that the energy strategy aligns with our existing policy Frameworks and programs and advances all the various existing moving finally as I mentioned before the policy recommendations will build on the findings of the technical analysis next slide please so to wrap things up I just wanted to leave you with a few of the important types of questions that we hope to answer or at least Advance towards a more helpful answer in the energy strategy these include what are the costs and benefits of the clean energy transition how much clean energy do",

eight which is okay use your house which is right here and right here um so right up against property line there's 30 for 30 Beats from what I see on the map or anything the buildings are going to be 38 feet four inches tall from floor level that doesn't mean in my neighborhood when you guys have developed erase the grade behind erase the race so we're talking 40 feet and 40 feet tall that my neighbors are going to look at they put all the building all we're asking for is on the perimeter that the areas that meet our street and Seattle slope dropping down the two story give us that little buffer a good local local government that's your neighborhood give us something because I mean I've been in my neighborhood for over 25 over 25 years in my street I've seen a lot of stuff going on like I said we don't have any saved you you know we're in the county you guys are in the city you guys do what you want in the city please I didn't talk to the neighborhood association they don't have or Southeast they're not having meetings on next week so that's why there's no comments on what street that you guys are going to be putting through once again it's going to be our street is 34 feet Supply the post is 30 feet wide according to the map all we would like is a couple speed humps on our um stop signs I know stop signs you know everybody loves stop signs but those are just a suggestion of people whether they want to stop or not steampunks will actually deter people from speaking to our neighborhoods as far as the Chariots it's I mean we don't in our area we're going to have over 1200 apartments with this new complex it's not conducive to the neighborhood because we don't have any public transportation everything so you know whatever you guys take that as however you want the walkway to the school you guys say that oh yeah school districts say no we're not going to be able to they're not going to open it so it's just a yeastless path that people will just graffitiative I mean Marco and their family they live on Seattle Slew they see a lot of this stuff and I'm not saying you know like I said all we want is just maybe a little bit of a nicer look from our neighborhood because we do live in the and we have tons of apartments around us all we want is just a minute okay thank you um questions from commissioners thank you for your time so I live right in this okay all right thank you any further thank you Mr is there anybody else that would like to come up to the podium and testify you sure can't help going up there and you could just state your name and the area that you live in or your address that you would have Finance also yeah I had one thing I know it's at my time zone um wait let's let these folks testify hi hi my name is she wants to address that there is a car accident that she had been through here that I was on um there's there's some of our neighbors strike really fast leaving that let me see here about 10 years ago that's what he says and I'm just really concerned about the graffiti in our neighborhood um yeah and my name is Marta huggler Jr I've lived here at this house since um with my parents since I was a sixth grader at Pop middle school so I've seen like the development of everything and it breaks quite hard to see on the homeless in the neighborhood um sometimes I want to feel bad for them I want to do something about it our church is also in Brooklyn Road so we we live in our neighborhood so we tried starting like sometimes I'm up really late at night and I'm just like I never see them graffiti but I do see people in the area by the WinCo so there are camps there's been camps in our neighborhood at the very Dead End Sales clue and um and we don't want to be aggressive towards them but we sometimes want to be um graduates in the city um I also think it's a great idea to put that pedestrian bridge I think the the way that things have been developing it's it's been very well done but at the same time it's not as a lot more effort like if you guys don't know really where the neighbors to get out of our street like the Caribbean do you guys need to be going out to our neighbors and actually like spending some time around here but homelessness um I also think that um that we need to get more of the neighbors together um I go to the I'm single and I'm not kids but I go to the city so I go to the school board meetings at Marion Miller because um I believe that kids need to be raising good schools nowadays but um there has to be like a awareness of their Community to um together everyone together that lived there that have been there for decades but my neighbors here as well I have a door knocking for like the last campaign but the governor so I I believe in our name we have a good neighborhood and some other are a reserve elderly and they're scared they don't know that they know about the meeting they still decide so that so um my only thing I believe is that we can just pray for that development of the touch back on to thank you um these are single family this area here is two stories these two are also two-story Apartments this is a three-story apartment complex and as you can see that it it butts up next to two stories so the president is there that with this neighborhood here on polo in this neighborhood and this apartment complex and this apartment complex and these residential homes they went with the two stories um also so you know it's it's there we can you guys can adjust it give us just three units that are two story also um the multi-tech lady said that there was neighborhood meeting we never never received a notice about it never heard anything about it so are you within 250 people yeah I'm right here's the property yes and here's my three three blocks down in the edge of the property yeah so the neighborhood association is a volunteer organization correct conversation I know you guys live in a county but you can still participate in the city one that surrounds you but they don't send notice of all their needs they just meet regularly every month I can get on their website and get on an email list for their agenda but they don't send out they don't have money until they invite people every month to their meeting so I understand that they assume yeah now you can see a disconnection between the city and Academy of people that live in the county so we don't have this information so we did some notice of the public hearing so you got that notice right about the neighborhood association notice for people that have never heard right into contact in our city our neighborhood association guy that was listed on the sheet and he said he's out of town um here we are by myself like I said we're not opposing it I'm just want some conditions a little bit extra any additional questions for Mr group thank you you do have the benefit of lower property taxes okay um questions of staff and then we'll have the applicant come back up and rewrite any other questions at this point or staff but the conditions of approval uh that's the code specifically prohibits limit you know putting conditions on the developments of under the heights there's the highest below the maximum allowed it would end up in the development density is not above the maximum it's required to stay long you know conservative jurisdictions can't you know make it harder to meet a thousand so I just wanted to put that up and the speed limits those would be in Marion County uh into their own class that's a good clarification thank you okay with the applicant like to come up in reverse and think that he was actually about for five minutes thank you again Brandi belt with multi-tech we do appreciate Neighbors coming out it's I think it's important for them to know what's going on in their neighborhood my contact information is available so they're always welcome to contact me ask additional questions and see what's going on in their neighborhood as things progress on the site um a couple things did come up as far as the buildings along Clydesdale and Grading uh this is not we will be doing rain along the north poverty line but that area will not be elevated and we will be meeting the required setback in which is 30 feet as shown on the study plan on the landscaping and it'll events so those are requirements that we have to abide by somebody did bring a prime and the graffiti in the area and they're right I went out to this site and it's being used as a dump site it's um there's homeless there so what some people don't always realize is that with more development what comes more eyes on the screen which can create um safety in the area to and you know to get this area developed you don't have hopeless living on the site you know people keeping an eye on the roads and their neighbors so that's typically what comes from additional development especially on vacant lot this size and the last thing I wanted to address was the neighborhood meeting we did notify the neighborhood association and I also a virtual open house so and how that wasn't everybody within 258 of the small piece was notified it was online and the site was posted as well I don't have that date and on the prices but um that was done as a requirement for the conference of change awesome so that's it great any I don't have one question um and maybe I misread this but did I hear correctly that it's going to be a fully indicated Community yes there will not be access through it that's correct it's pedestrian just pedestrian access to it but it will be dense that's required okay so particular um prevention and vehicular access outside of that community correct only pedestrians can pass through it we have our street connections for vehicles so obviously those vehicles are going to be able to go through the neighborhood but it will be it'll be fenced along the boundaries where there aren't vehicle access that's what you need okay so there won't be it's not literally dated people are talking about like a date for the interest no we do have some developments that do that this will not be one of those because of the",

        "text": "am for the permitting of this project incredibly collaborate collaborative and the process took about four weeks to so really quite something for for a rooftop project of this size next slide please so as far as opportunities um i'm not going to focus specifically on portland for this slide um i think there's some larger pieces to the puzzle there but i i would say that you know the overarching themes here are making these processes more streamlined consistent if we had a consistent platform that everyone was using and consistent submittals that everyone was looking for that we could really help not only the but the jurisdictions um processing these permits um in order you know after streamlining and making it all easier it would be really great to see reduced permitting fees and and part of the the permitting process is obviously looking at the code um that were uh that we're bound by and that's the the specialty code at this point so kind of a two-fold thing making sure that we have our our code um consistent and concise and then delivering that into a permitting system that would be consistent hopefully next slide please katie just a heads up that you're a couple minutes over so i don't know if you okay okay um we can yeah we'll wrap it up here thank you this is uh this is the last slide we'll show them um and just kind of reiterates the the opportunities i believe we're showing a project here within the city of milwaukee again a city that from the mayor to all the departments incredibly supportive of solar the permitting for this project took about three weeks any questions all righty well thank you katie i see one question from rumfus uh thanks for the you know presentation um this is kind of helps understand a little bit of the permitting process um i guess you meant you mentioned a note here about at least for city of course in like staff capacity or staff being under staff being uh being an issue i guess i kind of wonder if that's true for jurisdictions um given that i from my perspective seems like bds has probably more staff on their permitting side than other um cities or counties so i don't know if if you can say more i know you at least highlighted one example here in this last slide of something that was streamlined but just kind of curious if um understaffed departments are is is a common issue in other other other agencies or if it's just more of a conglomerate of different issues that the day is an issue anyway i hope my question makes sense but just trying to understand how big of an issue this is for for other jurisdictions right um i hear it most from city of portland that they're understaffed it's also a function of they are they are staffed based on their revenue their revenue comes from permits they're they're one of the only bureaus that doesn't get outside money from the city um so i've heard that that plays a part in it um as far as other jurisdictions um yes but they're much smaller and they're dealing with a lot less development and workload but when you look at the city of portland and you look at how they process permits and the number of people that have to look at it i feel like that's where some of the uh they they may be understaffed in ways or they may be deploying that staff um you know not as efficient as possible thanks katie and thanksgiving peace hey one um one thing that would be really helpful when folks ask questions um if you could say just like what organization you're representing like rain feasts works with blue green alliance um just because we have for example a wonderful new staffer and i want to make sure if she knows who you are ring piece so that'd be really helpful and thanks so much for that answer katie we have another question in the chat from diane is there a rooftop solar potential this one might be for you rob you ready is there a rooftop solar potential map for the different cities uh for example portland salem medford bend our throughout oregon and if so is that a state database set as a state we don't have a resource map for rooftop solar there are tools out there including like google earth associated tools that will enable a essentially a remote site assessment to be conducted and that might even provide kind of community-wide attributes of rooftop or solar but we don't have that as a as a state great thanks for sharing that and um diane was i didn't follow the rules but diane did she um represents small business interests at this table thank you so much dan all right i don't see any other hands up um we can go ahead yeah there's a hand up thanks sorry a new one hi there my name is natalie i'm actually with the city of milwaukee i'm the climate and natural resources manager um i just want to echo that our our building team is fantastic um but you know one thing that milwaukee has done uh really well particularly on pretty much any goal that our council sets so climate um equity and housing is when we're developing these processes they're they're really um they really try to work with staff to make sure that we're reducing barriers particularly on the process side uh both for permit fees but then around applications so um i know that that's something that that our building team as well as every other kind of group works hard at the city staff group that the city works hard to do um so i'm really happy to hear that um you had a good experience working with milwaukee on this because it's always a gem in the crown seeing these these amazing solar installations um i know one challenge that i can share just around permitting for solar particularly for small communities that we have is we all use to my understanding um we all use a cella a state program for and uh there are different tiers of essentially a cella subscriptions that a city can have and some of them are like the basic free one which is what milwaukee has and then some of them come at a cost but you can essentially uh customize your permanent applications you can ask different questions on the permits etc so um we are right now we have the the free one for sela so we're just using kind of our electrical permit for for things like solar installations um i know for me when i've been trying to do like you know analyses of of what permits we've been in taking it can almost be challenging on the staff side because we don't we can't ask all the questions that would make i mean easy questions for for folks to answer we wouldn't want to throw up any more barriers but just even like what's the capacity of the sometimes contractors willingly provide that information on the application which is fantastic because then we can record it but um so i would note that for small communities just even like a a permitting system could be something that could be unintentionally throwing up barriers for both staff as well as developers um i know we are hopefully transitioning to a a new online permitting system that will allow that customization we'll still be keeping essentially the the brevity and making sure we're expediting permits particularly if they align with city goals around say like middle housing solar developments etc um but i know i'm assuming that for other small communities that maybe don't have the resources to pay for kind of these more robust permitting systems that could potentially be one of the the challenges around regional consistency but then also just making sure that we're we're tailoring permits um to ask essentially the minimal amount of information but in the most optimal way possible yeah and so and then also um you know cities particularly around middle housing developments and such um i would say there's another opportunity which is including code variances for solar so um you know one thing that i manage is our tree code as a city and we have in our new tree code which we just adopted we actually have essentially written out variances for meeting tree code if you are able to show that you're going to be installing a sustainable or you know carbon free electric um energy generation option or other sustainable development characteristics so that's an opportunity is checking out city codes and seeing what variances are spelled out for things like solar great natalie i love the focus on possible solutions and um and recommendations that we could potentially make in the report that was really helpful we have these presentations in a timeline and we want to have a break but then we have a piece of staffer that's on our group with their hand raised and i feel like i have i need to call on james so james i know you know how to be concise and then um we'll just work on trying to kind of make up the time as we go but just know that um we all we can like you can always like circle back to ideas that you might have that come out of this conversation so james will go ahead and let you roll and then um we'll get on to our next presentation after thank you christy and and thank you katie for for the presentation and for really continued engagement on permitting issues with staff and so yeah uh as christie mentioned i'm with i am with the city of portland but in the bureau of bureau of planning and sustainability um where i helped work on the portland clean energy fund which was just want to note again as katie mentioned that because of our bureau structure that is a different entity than the bureau of development services which is responsible for actually issuing permitting um or issuing permits but we as the bureau of planning and sustainability are responsible for land use related and so just wanted to also note in terms of potential solutions there is a charter uh body that's been meeting and making recommendations to the city of portland about a change of that kind of siloed system of government and so there will likely be a a bald initiative in november to potentially change that structure which may be a partial solution and i have been engaged in permitting issues around solar for a very long time previous to this role but in a previous role with the city of portland and so it does seem like there's a little bit of deja vu of a lot of these issues and so i'm not trying to you know defend or make excuses but also just i think the perspective of some of the folks that work for bureau development services is that they are ensuring public safety in applying the structural code and then applying building codes which kind of as rob was saying regulations exist for a reason um and so one of the things that katie you",

        "text": " to provide perhaps most attractive though is renewable hydrogen um is a great candidate for longer duration energy which will be increasingly pressing need as more renewables are added to the grid and then also electronizers can serve as that variable variable load um in that they can increase their electricity demands at times of surplus and then can their demand can be decreased or even shut off quickly at times of high electricity demand and tight supply exactly those times when balancing becomes challenging so this graphic here is from evolved energy research's oregon clean energy pathway study and that uses a number of scenarios to determine how oregon might meet its clean energy goals the bottom graph shows what role electrolysis might play in grid balancing in oregon and in that bottom there that turquoise color is um so in all the scenarios electrolysis as load is increasingly from the late 2030s on and especially out in 2050 it plays a material role in almost all of the scenarios next slide please so and then another um challenge with um rps and 100 clean policy implementation uh and with decarbonization in general is that as more and more end uses are electrified utilities are expecting to see an increase in future demand thus not only must we replace fossil resources fossil electricity generating resources as we retire them but we also need to build a lot of new renewables to meet increasing demand this graphic here on the right is from the 2022 power plan and it shows the product projected edition of generation resources across the west to meet clean energy targets reaching possibly 400 gigawatts after that's a lot and so this means that competition for the best project sites with the best resources and transmission will be stiff and odo recently concluded uh a study the orisa study that um which found that the limits of the transmission system could present a challenge to renewable energy development at a significant scale in the state overall the study found that there were abundant resources in oregon to meet our goals but that transmission access could be one of the limiting california air resources board recently their updated scoping plan for implementation of their 100 percent clean electricity study clean electricity which uh the goal is 100 by 2045 and the scoping plan found that to meet this 2045 target annual build rates for solar must and over 500 for battery storage again it's it's difficult to over emphasize the challenge of how much we need to make happen to meet these and these figures from california this increase in 150 and 500 percent they don't include electricity for hydrogen production via electrolysis their analysis found that adding that in the state would need an equivalent of an additional 41 gigawatts of solar um so all of this is to say that we need to we need to put um sorry we need to build a lot of resources um and they're going to be a lot of end uses seeking renewable resources only one of which is electrolysis next slide please this is an area that we're still investigating as part of the study but it is possible that instead of potential hydrogen producers competing for renewable energy projects with utilities who need to meet their 100 rps and clean electricity targets that electrolyzers could be paired with renewables without or really any transmission access so this map here shows the transmission assets in oregon and you can see big pockets of the state in the northeast and in the southeast without real transmission resources and these pockets also happen to be where there are a lot of solar resources and then also if you look out to the coast to the coos bay area this is where offshore wind potential in oregon is best and there is transmission there as you can see but available access to transmission is relatively constrained and certainly uh would be um for any new large offshore wind um so all this is to say that production of renewable hydrogen via electrolysis will need renewable electricity but it's possible to find that supply of renewables in a way that doesn't necessarily strain compliance with the rps or 100 next slide our initial findings for how renewable hydrogen can support 100 percent clean and the rps is that renewable hydrogen would most likely be of help for these policies in integrating other renewables onto the grid but it's not necessarily expected to be used as a generation resource itself to meet rps 100 clean in the near term um you know certainly it can be used as a flexible um generation resource uh to provide some of those balancing um uh service needs um but it's not expected that we're gonna see it really widely deployed as a specific generating for the rps again it's also a flexible load and it can help out with long-duration energy storage so all in all of these ways renewable hydrogen can really kind of help serve as is kind of helping these two policies continue on and meeting some of the challenges associated with them um you know and then i mentioned that as we overbuild uh renewables in the state there is that opportunity for surplus electricity and so the cost of renewable hydrogen could be mitigated by use of some of that low-cost renewable electricity um there are certainly still questions we have as to kind of what the economics of that look like for an electrolyzer facility in terms of if they have a lower capacity because they're not running all the time because they're really trying to help meet balancing needs by serving as a variable kind of what degree does getting cheaper electricity make up for that lower and then again um electrolyzers paired with dedicated renewable resources could potentially help mitigate transmission accesses across oregon um as we build more renewables um so i am gonna pause there it sounds like we've got some questions yes thanks rebecca um a couple questions the first from uh kathy um asking if isn't there usually a lot of excess electricity that could be used for electrolyzers and can did put in the in the chat that as you pointed out even areas with existing transmission are congested for transmitting new solar but anything else to add to kathy's question there yeah that's a great question kathy and you know if if if you've ever heard of the duck curve in california um and even if you haven't it all refers to what happens on a spring day in california where you know because there are so many solar resources in the middle of the day there is just so much more solar energy um then is needed for consumption and so you have all of that excess now california certainly tries to find a home for that you know maybe exports it but otherwise it can be um curtailed we don't have the same profile in the northwest as california for one we certainly don't have the same level of installation but then also our system is a little different and it's more affected with respect to times of peak demand is is more uh um and related to the hydro system but we still expect to have to build a lot renewable capacity to meet our clean energy and carbon goals and that means we are going to have more curtailment now what was the second question um the next question is from robert uh what was the source of the figure that stated 41 gigawatts of additional resources would be needed in oregon to hydrogen via electrolysis um i'm so glad you asked that robert and apologies if i didn't make that clear um i was quoting that as part of uh california's uh analysis for their own system we um don't have kind of the same level of uh analysis right now for how oregon is going to meet it's a 100 clean standard um our policy is definitely newer than california's um but so it was them looking at kind of what their build rates would mean be to build to i'm sorry to meet their 2045 target and that's in their 2022 scoping plan for sb100 great um the next question there's a couple of great comments by the way from um keith from nrel and from ken uh talking about some of the um electroslizer questions as well um and then a question from shannon does the study show that organ needs long duration energy storage from likely electrolysis and fuel cells for seasonal and rare event long duration storage that's a great question and you know thus far long duration storage has been discussed in oregon pretty generally in that we need it and it's expected that um you know traditional battery storage is not gonna cut the mustard it's um you know at when you start moving from short duration to long duration the economics just don't make sense and so that's where you start looking to other opportunities and so you have um you know pumped hydro is one uh hydrogen is another and then there are a few you know other options for long duration storage nrel really considers hydrogen one of the top for seasonal storage um and so whether that would be paired with fuel cells or whether that would go into a turbine and be combusted those are all questions um that just aren't clear at this point um and then the next question from david it might be more of a discussion question for later but i think it's worth you know asking rebecca if there's something to clarify here um if renewable hydrogen is not expected to be used as a generation resource what does odo expect renewable hydrogen will be used for specifically the renewable hydrogen generated to help incorporate higher penetrations of renewable resources might get back to rebecca your earlier comment of further study needed to understand pathways for 100 clean but if you have something to clarify there go ahead otherwise we can also talk about this during the discussion yeah david um so certainly um in the in the near term we're not seeing any movement from utilities um where they're pla they're including in their planning documents any intentions build out big facilities to meet you know utility scale renewable hydrogen production for generation um that said we expect project developers to um to be building their own projects in the nearer term though electricity generation isn't necessarily best use case um certainly it can play a role there like i said especially for grid balancing and in the longer term uh we may see we may see it replace you know natural gas combustion who knows but in the near term and i'll touch on this later with expected end uses of renewable hydrogen in oregon is that um given the cost of renewable electricity um you know it's it could interfere with that cost cap in the the rps and 100 clean uh standard to development right now when it is higher and then",

Utility Commission and I was just having trouble with the web act so I'm on now great M Decker um it's a little more challenging to have have as many people as we have uh but it's it's very welcome that we do have as many as people as we have um on the commission and so bear with me as I um as we ma figure out how to best manage uh roll call uh in this circumstance um and uh again thank you to the other staff that are joining us today representing uh directors that were not able to get this on their calendar so believe that's the end of roll call uh anybody else that I missed that's a director um legislator or voting member great thank you can you hear me this is Cheryl shwer excellent we can hear you now Cheryl thanks for joining us than you excellent thank you okay with that I think we can go to the next slide and I'll turn things over to Allan to kick us off um oh excuse me does do any Commissioners want to provide uh any other updates before we go into our regular business and if you do please raise your hand it's a little hard to see when people rais their hand on WebEx so if we miss you go ahead and um you're yourself and and jump in it looks like director Benner yeah hi good morning not an update I just wanted to extend a warm welcome to all of the new director members of the global warm sorry the Oregon climate action commission we're really um excited to expand it and bring your perspectives and expertise to this conversation um and I think you'll find that it's a commission full of really um engaged and um dedicated folks to helping the state meet our climate goals and and really glad you're here and thanks for making the time thank you director Gabriella good morning everybody Gabriela Goldfarb environmental Public Health uh manager at the Oregon Health Authority and here on behalf of oh today but we have a brand new uh director who started last week and wasn't able to get her briefed and ready to participate today but we'll be circling up back and doing that and then an update wanted to let folks know that the inaugural request for Grant applications for the healthy homes grant program should be released within about a week and um and this is an important um pathway for resourcing organizations that uh will do both very important climate work but equally environmental justice and equity and health work so very excited to share that and I'll put a link just to our web web page uh in the chat and we'll put an announcement out once the request for Grant applications is available thank you Gabriella it's exciting to hear any other updates or okay with that um let's go to our next agenda item Allen uh thank you chair McDonald I would like to introduce and um Amy Amy schoer she's um many of you know that Zack Baker left Odo and Amy is our new climate lead at Odo um and uh Odo is getting about two dozen new positions from the legislature in the the last long session uh in planning and Innovation where Amy and I sit uh there's 15 that includes the four new uh climate action and natural working lands positions so Amy's not new to Odo she's actually been with us for a while she's been the uh clean energy or renewable energy uh um policy analyst lead in that area so she's shifting over her duties um and uh um with all the workload and all the exciting things that are happening finally in in the climate change Arena um we really felt like in planning and Innovation we needed a new section just dedicated to climate action and natural working land so we have a new climate section which has five people in it uh and Amy's is leading that up as the as the lead and um it has the two it has the other Amy's position is actually one of the climate action leads she'll be replacing Zach's position uh we'll be replacing Zach's position fair Fairly short order so it'll go out um or an opening so if you know any good people in that who want to take on uh working on climate change uh stay tuned probably put that out in a week or two uh probably next week then we also have the uh uh other climate action position which is a a technical position helping us track all of this stuff and then we also have the two natural working lands position one policy position and one technical position which we're working on processing those position descriptions so we can get them out the door too so uh keep keep your uh eyes tuned towards uh those positions if you know any great people that would that you think should apply please let them know that that's coming and to keep an eye out on on our web page um Amy will be uh working with me to lead that group of people working on all this climate change stuff um and uh as part of that uh work uh in and and uh part of the fixes that we're that we needing to do in the legislature this uh short session in sb525 uh is the pushing out of the natural and working lands uh deadlines for the inventory in this and the study so we're we're move put those into uh they're in legislation so we have to put them in a in a legislative fix of bill um and Christy uh split when she does her upcoming legislative update can answer any questions about that and touched on that a little bit more when we get to that part of the meeting so with that I'll turn it over to Amy and Amy can talk about board Recruitment and new members and and getting on a regular meeting schedule go ahead Amy yeah thank you Alan and hi everybody it's nice to see all of you and meet those of you that I haven't met before um so recruiting new Commissioners for appointment by the governor is one of our top top priorities and just as a reminder to everyone on the commission we have a few vacancies right now we have um five voting member seats that are vacant an environmental justice seat a youth seat a fishing industry seat a manufacturing seat and then one at large voting member seat and then we have three non voting at large member seats that are currently vacant um and these seats are open to state agency staff or AC or staff of institutions so we are currently finalizing a process with the governor's office for recruiting these new members and so stay tuned for more updates on that um we also recently sent out welcome letters to the new agency director members and we'll be scheduling new member orientations with any interested new Commissioners and then finally we are working to put together a regular commission meeting schedule for 2024 the intent is to convene monthly um with the exception of some busy times like during short session and we'd like to establish that schedule as soon as possible so that everyone can get these meeting dates on their calendars um but before we can do that we want to we are currently reviewing the meeting schedules of member agency boards and commissions in an effort to avoid conflicts with those meetings wherever possible and so so we we will be reaching out to all Commissioners with some proposed dates in the near future so keep an eye out for um some Communications related to scheduling and now I think I will pass it over to Kathy unless anyone has any questions um Amy it would be great if uh you or Abby could maybe drop the link into to the chat as to where people can go if they want to apply to be considered uh as a a member of the commission sure I will um and you know feel free to take a little time because to to do that it's not easily at hand um yes I well I will have to have ask Abby to do that I don't actually have access to the chat chat right now because I'm sharing my screen but we will take care of that okay great thank you very much just want to make sure that people know um what that process looks like or where to go to find out about the thank you yeah uh next uh agenda item which is our public comment and um I will rely on Abby to help us identify how many people want to comment we have had one in the chat say that they want to provide comment okay can you just do it sorry go ahead so if anyone else does feel free to put that in the chat or to raise your hand right now um so we can make sure we get to on list great thanks Abby so I think the the first person is uh Megan kle welcome Abby have you been able to unmute Megan okay you should be unmuted there we go hello welcome Megan it's great to have you thank you chair McDonald and Commissioners I'm Megan kle executive director with the Oregon climate and agriculture Network Oran for short like to provide feedback on the natural working lands fund proposal orcan was a strong advocate for the natural climate Solutions Bill along with the farmers and ranchers in our network over 50 farms and ranches endorsed the bill farmers and ranchers testified at public hearings on the bill in person virtually and with written they also met with our legislators they expressed their interest in adopting natural climate Solutions and the need for financial support engagement from organs farmers and wrenchers was critical and help Garner the legislative support needed to pass the Bill they're invested in the effectiveness of the $10 million do natural and working lands fund and so are we the purpose of the fund is to establish and Implement programs to provide incentives to help land owners land managers Indian tribes and environmental justice communities adopt practices that support natural climate Solutions and financial assistance for technical support for these same communities or can the farmers we work with who review The Proposal are concerned the proposal doesn't include adequate funding for financial incentives for farmers and ranchers there a small portion of the proposed use of the funds by oeb for the Oregon agricultural Heritage program for payment for conservation practices on agricultural land and there's some funding in oda's proposed native seed strategy for financial assistance including tribal Farmers overall we see at most $800,000 of the 10 million proposed less than 10% for financial incentives provided by the state for farmers and ranchers to adopt natural climate Solutions we recommend allocating more funding to or explicitly providing flexibility for oeb to allocate more funding to the Oregon egg Heritage program to clarify that recommend allocating",

        "text": " beginning we've had lots of conversations the work and the the the additional Community collaborations that have come to support the work that they're doing has just been incredible I mean we've had people Nick Harville was a key player very early on and bringing the right people to the uh to the table to make sure that they could be successful our planning department building codes everybody has been awesome so so um you know the the proof is really right here I mean industry standard says about $235 a foot right now we actually know that's really low for the canyon uh but it's still one it's about the whole person and I think one of the things that I love about our community is that we don't think that the government is the end all be all right the government is part of this ecosystem it's part of this Greater Community and um just the way that the churches have come together and the nonprofits and the local businesses and everybody working together to to rebuild the canyon I think is so so important um and I know Joe and your team one of the things that I love about how you do your work is you're not just building a house you're you're showing love to these people and and you're um trying to be there for them personally spiritually um and and you're putting your your time and your money where your mouth is you know and so I I just appreciate uh that we're not just we are saving the taxpayers money right we're doing I mean this is an unbelievable um really Joe's and his team are doing it but really it's more than that it's it's more about trying to make as folks as whole as they can be after such a traumatic thing yeah yeah very thankful to have Joe it's been incredible so I do want to share a couple uh we we have some photos because I think those are super awesome to see the work actually being done so this was a home for Miss Ruggles it was approved in August um and here we got some pictures of some crew Jesse th from Ontario Canada and other volunteers that came from warsa Indiana and in this picture they're working on drywall and so um you know this is all the time they're doing this work day in and day out and again this home was just approved in August and I mean it's pretty close to being done which is incredible um this is uh the Smith family and we have a quote here from Mr Smith it says life is full of up and downs we are so grateful and appreciative to the efforts and contributions set aside by Maran County and its Commissioners in helping us return to pre- Wild fire state of life thank you to everyone who has assisted in this up in our family Tim Smith and family and so this is their house they have a three-bedroom house being built and we got crew leader Ernie Van Pelt and his crew from Indiana uh doing some work in the kitchen so um it's awesome to drive up in the canyon you see that trailer out there doing good work and you know great things are happening in locations then we got uh the home of Mr Peak and so these are photos just a couple weeks apart and the one on the left is actually prepaint uh and then it's got this beautiful barn red which is great um and Mr Peak wrote a phenomenally long and wonderful uh testimony on it but I pulled out a couple things and it says I've been struggling to get back to some kind of normaly since than having a place to call my own and piece of mind I've always tried to be self-sufficient and not be dependent on others they have made me feel like I have received more of a hand up instead of a hand out and so um you know this is an individual that when we got his application he frankly had no hope and uh you know it was wonderful to be able to look at this and and work with our dis disaster case managers to get this one across the board um this one here is uh our very first cam home approval and this was our uh Mr Gibson in Lynn County uh and this was the very first one it was super exciting to get this one across the finish line and you know it's got a it's got a nice shade of green uh which will look really good out there in his little piece of property and we're just really thankful to to be able to work with uh Mr Gibson and every once in a while I get an email from him and it's he's really excited so um this is an example of what we kind of call an other type of project and so this Survivor uh his house was uh in the canyon and there was a retaining wall that needed to be put in as you can see in the photo on the right there was just a little bit of an embankment that was uh going to potentially threaten uh his home and you know uh we got that through the through the finish line and then his backyard was just a mud hole and so part of what existed prior to the fire was the patio and so we were able to get some funding for this and overall the the cost of this was under $10,000 and so it's a big impact for this individual uh with with frankly very little uh effort on our part and so it was great to get that done and he is essentially done with in full recovery at this point which is which is great and this is just kind of some general quotes from our case managers uh you know we have a couple Hazard tree projects that we've been able to get out and those will be taken care of here towards the end of March uh as Aaron mentioned earlier we have the window panels being replaced and uh so those will be going in on the 13th weather permitting if it's super wet they can't get those installed and then we have another awning here for a back deck where uh you know the Survivor had trees all around their property beforehand uh which kind of helped divert rain away from their house and now there's no trees and so this just provides a little bit of uh refuge for them as they're uh going into their house and this one here uh so this was kind of a story here and what it says is on a Sunday morning in late February two of our case managers uh Alana and Patty uh made a quick trip up into the canyon it was a beautiful day they stopped at three houses and they were able to see uh the the foundation being laid here and this is two photos of the foundation being laid at uh what I believe is a cam home you can see the trailer in the background on the right side picture uh and they stated disaster Services is honored to partner with the folks from Christian ad Ministries and helping families rebuild in the canyon the work that is being done by this group is beautiful exciting and very encouraging to see they're excited that this is the third row third year in the row that cam has been here and that um they really appreciate uh the work that's being done and that it always seems these projects always seem impossible until they're done and so um just really kind of exciting to take a look at that so what we continue to do is we continue to reach out to survivor families we've recently sent out correspondents to some individuals uh we continue to work towards determining eligibility for our various Maran County programs not just this program but also you know our septic program and any other programs that exist to assist uh Marian County families and ly County families and recovery um as Joe mentioned cam is actively working to determine eligibility uh and feasibility for families into next year's build season which is incredible and the sanan hospital disaster Services team continue to support and advocate for Wildfire survivors so lastly I think it's important to thank the 2021 legislature and the Oregon housing community services for their work in bringing the $12 million to our Canon communities we want to thank the Sanam Canyon long-term Recovery Group for their continued and unwavering devotion to the recovery efforts want to thank the Sanam hospital and the disaster Services team for always supporting survivors since the beginning uh want to thank Lyn County I want to personally thank the Board of Commissioners and Jan and Aaron for for being along this project the whole entire time it's been a lot of fun and lastly to each and every business agency local government employee volunteer neighbor new customer helping hand and thoughtful gesture thank you recovery is happening because of you and and I just want to make one more note Oregon housing community services is um asking survivors that believe they qualify for the various Community Development block grant disaster recovery programs to start getting their documentation together specific information on that can be found on re oregon.gov that's r. oregon.gov and so um they have their uh two programs that they're hoping to launch soon and they're encouraging survivors to get their paperwork together so with that I will stop talking and entertain any questions if you all have some I already said all my stuff I I'm it all those thank yous and I I uh I mean we're still working on this um commissioner Willis and I were in the capital last night till 6:30 um and I was just making a note here yet last night we testified on U Senate Bill 1545 which it it passed the Senate um unanimously and yesterday they passed it out it's going to go to the house floor and it's the property tax reset bill um but that's just one and what you're doing here opened I'm just going to go back through this as I drove through the fire that night and our sheriffs were up there right you know getting everybody out um Jan got the fairgrounds open the state fair the connections with Maran County um Jan hired two retired city managers one of them sitting in the audience right now and still with us to go up and help Detroit and Gates I think we took a couple checks up there right away to help them keep their keep paying their bills sore Nick Harville the construction Alliance groundbreaking the Detroit Community Center got built currently has been basically almost given back to the city city of Detroit building permits our building department waved all the building fees for people who had had their homes destroyed septic grants that we were able to get and if your septic needed repairs or replaced get it pretty much done property tax rebate that we worked on in 20121 I believe uh people got their property tax statements and I remember Comm wills and I sitting there going wow",

specializes in the housing needs of our Oregon residents and has been working to help Oregon residents for many years we recently completed Applegate Landing in Lebanon Oregon this was our 48 unit prototype veterans focused affordable housing complex that we completed in not too easy during the covid but we were able to complete the project on time and on budget actually the Applegate project in Lebanon has close to a 50 percent occupancy rate of veterans and their families which I hear is very good always wanted more but 24 out of 48 kind of comes and goes a little bit but that's a pretty good for the little town of Lebanon this prototype project has been a great success for our residents and our small town of Lebanon seeing the ever increasing need to help our veterans and low-income families over the last several decades I decided to use my construction experience to take the first steps to build a veterans housing project with resident services on site a private prototype project that would house train and support the needs of our local veterans and our vulnerable populations Applegate is teamed up with Crossroads communities for our on-site resident services Crossroads I apologize James but your time expired okay I have a couple of questions for you and others may as well I apologize that we had to cut you off that's okay it was a fast three minutes it goes by really fast doesn't it can you give us an idea of your timeline so our our uh estimate for timeline is we want to start in the spring of 2024 and we will start Lisa in the early summer late spring of 2025. and if I if I recall correctly this is this Project's located over in West Salem is that right yes sir thank you are there any other questions counselor hoy I just want to say I believe we have a former customer at the restaurant who was so relieved to know there was a place to go and he went to Lebanon and is quite happy there so thank you for that work um the other thing was what's your last basically the last paragraph was just wanting to help showcase the other benefits of this project in West Salem and we were able to successfully negotiate the easement needed to start Marine Drive in West Salem so we worked with some locals there and you know in all the 25 or more years of everybody's hard work and I came in and luckily this person that had this property was a veteran and we connected on that level and so we were able to get this person um Grant the easement that the city needed to start Marine Drive awesome thank you very much thank you thank you for your testimony thank you Kendra Alexander reminder you have three minutes but if you yeah you're good the green light's on if you'd state your name and your address or your award for the record please yeah good evening my name is Kendra Alexander I'm a resident of Ward four but I am here in my professional capacity as the Director of operations of Mary and Pope food chair the food charts office and warehouse is located in Ward 5 and our Meals on Wheels kitchen is at Center 50 plus on the border of one in five thank you for this opportunity to speak and for considering our grants for our Meals on Wheels program and our food purchase program as well uh These funds will make a significant positive impact for thousands of Salem our Meals on Wheels program provides home delivered meals 700 to 750 seniors and date disabled adults every day and we do that with the help of 300 volunteer drivers who deliver these meals and provide a vital daily wellness check for these homebound Neighbors every month about 20 000 Salem residents receive food that the food share provides to our partner agencies and currently our partner agencies are seeing sometimes triple the amount of people that they have been seeing since the SNAP benefits the expanded SNAP benefits were were removed or timed out the vast majority of our food is donated but there are some gaps in the kind of food that gets donated so the funds from the City of Salem helps to fill those gaps by allowing us to purchase foods like milk produce eggs meat rice beans Masa flour cereal peanut butter and many uh we purchased bulk food by the truckload as much as we possibly can to maximize the impact of every dollar that is provided for us and we also know that housing and Homeland homelessness are key challenges in our community and the food chair believes that food assistance is an important resource in addressing these challenges when families receive healthy food from a food pantry they have more money to put towards rent utilities gas for their car to get to work money for the laundry mat whatever whatever it might be Health medical bills this improves their ability to stay in their homes and not lose their housing the food share is grateful for every organization in town that provides services to our neighbors without housing and we're glad that we can provide food directly to those organizations like arches the Salvation Army Union Gospel Mission Church at the park hoap home youth just to name a few food purchase funds from the city make it possible for us to provide food to these organizations along with thousands of other residents each month each month thank you again for the opportunity to speak tonight thank you so much for your testimony and thank you for the important partnership that we have with you providing so many meals to so many different residents and programs here in the city we literally couldn't do it without you and we're we so we're so grateful for all that the food share does but also as the mayor I could not I would be remiss if I didn't say I am so impressed with your knowledge of our Awards right up front you need three of them right off the bat and you know you're

        "text": "we are going to give people a little bit more time to sign on and get started uh just maybe in three or three minutes or so thanks for your patience all right good evening everyone and welcome to the oregon department of energy's webinar where we will be sharing information about the energy related provisions of the infrastructure investment and jobs act and seeking feedback from you as to how we can best shape our efforts to direct these resources to benefit oregon just a reminder that this is the second of two webinars that we are having on this topic our first webinar was on july 12th and we will be making the same presentation and covering the same materials tonight that we did on july all right my name is janine benner i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and again thank you so much for joining today very soon i will be turning this over to jen center our federal grants coordinator to lead the conversation and i'm also introduced by a few additional odo staff today and i'll ask themselves to introduce them i'll ask them to introduce themselves in the chat please and i'd actually welcome the other participants in the call to introduce yourselves in the chat with your name and if you're representing any particular organization we'd love to so i want to start off by acknowledging many of you likely have questions about the funding the timing whether or not a specific project that you're thinking of might be eligible under the funding streams we'll discuss today and at this time we also have many as we move through the presentation we hope that you will ask us questions and we will do our best to respond though uh we just may not have answers to everything yet and uh we may not have time to answer every question live today but if we don't get to them we'll gather up your questions and respond on our website in the weeks following this presentation if necessary because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance we have everyone muted currently but as we go through the presentation this evening we'll pause for questions and at that point we'll be able to unmute individuals to ask questions we'd also encourage you to use the chat function to ask questions as well we will be using some polling features for real-time feedback and finally in addition to responding and sharing your thoughts during this webinar you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up if you'd like more space to respond or more time to consider your responses and i am going to ask my colleague casey to put the link to the portal in the chat and she has a moment all right next slide please so here is an overview of today's that we'll be sharing information about our agency some background on infrastructure investment jobs act including highlights of energy related provisions then we will cover the community engagement work we've done so far and what lies ahead in our planning process towards the end we have specific opportunities for you to provide input and feedback we will also cover how we intend to use the information gathered through this and again the presentation materials are posted on our website and we're also recording this webinar so for those of you who are new to webex here's a quick guide on how to use some of the features as i mentioned before your unmute button and video buttons won't work but our host will be able to unmute you if we call on you to ask a question so you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand of the right hand side of your screen under the participants panel if you click near your name and there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments we'll have odo staff monitoring that and we'll make sure they get responded to live or in writing and and please send the question to all panelists it's an option under the drop out bar so that uh or everyone so the odo staff can see it and help respond and again we'll try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands but we might not have time for all of them um one more thing to highlight that's not on this slide is that on the right where you see participants and chat every once in a while there will be a poll that pops up and it will have the title slido on it so we encourage you to participate by checking a circle or a box and or entering a response and then don't forget to press send when you enter your response so it's actually submitted to us so before we jump in a quick introduction to the oregon department of energy or odo as you might hear us referred to on this slide you see our vision our mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future under what we do you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our and today we'll be discussing how federal funding opportunities can support our mission and our work on behalf of oregonians next slide please so our purpose today is twofold first to share what we know about federal funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act and second to seek your input as to how odo should approach these funding based on all the input that we receive build statements of guiding priorities which will help us shape our use of formula grants and choose which competitive grants may be the most beneficial for odo to pursue so we're actually going to start by asking you a question here so we can gauge your level of awareness on these topics as well as your assessment of your current capacity as of today we're going to start off with a poll to get a better sense of our audience and what level of understanding you have about the federal funding opportunities our host stacy will add the poll in and remember that it will appear under the title slido on the right side of your screen we'll give everybody about 45 seconds or so on this first poll to make your selection and don't forget to press send you may have to scroll down after you check the box so that you can see the send box everybody is seeing that so thinking about your organization or community which of these um phrases or phases or stages would you describe would describe how you feel when where you are in regards to federal funding so you haven't started or you're assessing options and interests prioritizing projects and funding implementing projects or plans or evaluate or expanding current book give folks some time here to respond i'm seeing that tim seeds slido but it's blank are other people having that problem i've noticed we have seven people voting so hopefully seven of the eight of you can see tim maybe close it and restart it tim for this one if you want to just put your response in the chat since i think you're the only one who hasn't been able to respond you can go ahead and do that oh good glad it worked okay i think we are ready to close this hole stacy right looks like a lot of people are assessing their options and interests and we've got some folks who are new to the topic so great glad we have a wide variety of folks joining so now i'm going to turn it over to jen to provide some background on the infrastructure investment and jobs act or iija the infrastructure investment and jobs act is actually what prompted this engagement today this federal law uh funds um american infrastructure projects related to a variety of areas from roads bridges to broadband internet to our energy and water systems and this was signed into law on november 15th of 2021 and this bipartisan legislature legislation authorizes 1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending nationally and that includes 550 billion in new funding so this is something that the biden administration is referring to as a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure systems and energy is certainly included as part of that investment the biden administration also has concerns about investing these federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically while there's many details and definitions still to be set at the federal level it's looking like the biden administration will likely direct 40 of the benefits of these funds that we'll be discussing today to serve disadvantaged communities and so we'll be keeping this requirement in mind that comes through us through multiple executive orders as we shape up all of our relevant proposals that may impact oregon and at odo we recognize that historically certain groups were left out of decision-making roles particularly when it comes to energy and land issues our intention is to better address equity concerns with iija funding but we recognize we have much to learn and much work to do in this area and that's part of the reason why we're seeking your input through this webinar and portal so just to help set the stage and identify some of the broader picture of what we're looking at are generally talking about federal funding which is then granted from the federal government to the state of oregon and this graphic here comes from one of the federal funding programs that represents how these funding streams that how this these monies actually reach oregon at their source they're appropriated by congress where they are then assigned to a federal agency to administer from there the funds are granted to the states through either formula or competitive grants and depending on the nature of of the fund and the federal requirements the state may combine the federal funding with other state or private dollars to invest in the work and at the end of the day because the law that is authorizing the funds is federal some of the funds are restricted in what they can be used for and that comes straight from the law that congress passed additionally federal agencies can set rules and issue guidance to further clarify the parameters of what's allowed under these federal funds as a result of that certain parts of the infrastructure investment and jobs act will have more flexibility in what they can be used for than other pieces of it but ultimately it all stems from the law authorized by congress so today we are seeking your input so that we can develop guiding priorities that will assist the agency with all aspects of our grant seeking for these federal funds in doing so we've been speaking to energy suppliers and developers energy-based or community-based organizations and local governments just to name a few to get their impressions of what we need to consider as",

        "text": " of the the reservation and we want to just kind of ensure that that isn't kind of a limiting factor for um low moderate income customers and low-income service providers accessing the program Thanks James hopefully that helps with the answer to that question um so we uh you're off mute I know you also went ahead in the chat but go ahead you're off me awesome thank you so much I think this is a really great program in terms of solar and storage and I was really excited about when it was first released a couple years ago um the unfortunate thing is you know I I took a deep dive into trainings I'm just a resident in southwest Portland I try to get solar and storage installed at my house in southwest Portland and um at that time Tesla had been a contractor in one of the approved contractors but since quit at the time that I was exploring solar in storage and what I found was that all the local Portland area contractors were anywhere from 25 to 30 percent higher than the most price competitive bid which was Tesla and when I looked at the numbers um difference was really uh still very even after accounting for the incentive and so um you know I I messaged uh James kogel this but I think that um many contractors at least when I was looking for solar and storage did not use the incentive to reduce the cost to the consumer when you look at it from the macro scale in terms of like what's the most price competitive and therefore did not pass on savings to customers what ended up happening was that the bids would go um the kind of much higher than uh kind of a price competitive bids of a non-participating contractor and that price was brought down to marginally competitive using the incentive and so I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not really surprised that this is happening because of just how involved industry Lobby is and and creating the um not only the the bill itself but involved in the rulemaking I think a more customer-centric way would be for the incentive to follow customers who can then use that incentive to shop around obviously that's not how the bill is written and that's not the under the purview of the rulemaking but I do think there's space in rule making to ensure to make sure that these funds are being used and passed on to improve access to solar and storage for customers but again I think right now if you were to do an audit of approved systems um and kind of what's available in terms of price competitive solar and Storage you'll see that um many contracts are um passing savings on to customers they're just basically padding the bottom line of these uh contracts which um as a end user I found disappointing and as a taxpayer I find um slightly unethical so I just wanted to provide that testimony because you know it got kind of this dismissive email from James Cole saying that um you know that it really wasn't under the preview of the rule making but um process to kind of uh but you know in terms of that comment but I think it is again because you know the legislative imperative is um this These funds should be to reduce the overall cost of solar and storage for the End customer and again my experience is that it has not been that well I really appreciate you coming and sharing that perspective today and I think we take it seriously that we want ensure that what you're talking about is not happening to the extent we can within the constraints of the existing which sounds a little like I don't love seeing that but I don't even I'd have to like look to see what what we can do I will say that there's new solar dollars coming from the federal government and there's new dollars for Energy Efficiency and those um grants applications so far have sort of included asking us like what our plans are to make sure that that's not what's happening because it is a major concern that um that folks could take advantage of the program to increase their bottom lines versus reducing reducing costs for customers so it's definitely something we have on our minds and I really appreciate you bringing it up today and all that if anyone else has anything they want to add go for it but I think that we're listening we hear you and um as we look at the rules we can see if there's anything there that we can change or tweak on that thank you so much I really appreciate that and just to hammer home the point had the incentive actually been effective at what it purported to do I would have solar and storage installed my house instead I don't um and so at least there's an N1 resident taxpayer potential customer who um uh you know I'm Savvy enough where I know where I'm not getting a good deal and when I got bids that span from you know forty thousand dollars up to a hundred thousand dollars for the same solar and storage system I know that there are some contractors who are taking advantage of the system and it was disappointing to see how just how prevalent that problem was so thank you um I will just say that Garrett there's somebody that Garrett who keeps chatting to like either privately or now he's to all panelists so let me he has a note for you I'm just gonna put it in and chat everyone he's saying he'd love to discuss with you offline I think he might be a contractor um okay Garrett also asked if there have been any discussions on removing the cap not to Pivot too much but going back to that question um there were discussions about removing the cap I think that uh lower volume contractors had concerns about that and that's my understanding that it remains sort of an area where there wasn't like um so by by moving the needle but still keeping the reservation cap might help preserve that balance that allows for the more mom-and-pop shops to continue to utilize the program and James feel free to weigh in if I'm misstating what we heard some of our smaller contractors that had a concern there Garrett no need to unmute and good luck with the kiddo you're doing great I'm using the chat um so I will just read aloud what's in the chat in case that's not accessible to everyone I know we've got a couple folks on the phone um from the industry perspective this is from Angela Crowley cook at osia solar contractors know that not everyone is participating in the rebate program and they need to be cost competitive and so it seems unlikely that they'd use the rebate to pad their bottom line in addition the Energy Trust keeps track of the cost to install solar and Oregon and they did not see an increase in cost when the rebate was introduced so perhaps that's helpful evidence I don't know much about the Tesla situation um so I can't maybe explain why they're more affordable than others but it could also be related to them just just being um but but I don't I don't know the answer but I just wanted to at least had to stay there and I'll show you saying the um solar Market is very opaque and even a cost-conscious engineer's last position had a hard time comparing Apples to Apples I hear that I work with Oregon Department of energy and spend a lot of time thinking about how to make everything easier on consumers and overall it's just an interesting and like with Energy Efficiency too it's just interesting and we passed we helped pass the Bill during session to create sort of a One-Stop shop on Energy Efficiency for now where a bunch of federal funding is coming into the state to help make it easier for folks and I'd love to see that expansea renewable energy too down the road to provide some sort of tips and there's a lot of really good information at the Energy Trust website too um I don't see any hands up and I don't see any more chats for now um there's an ETO report on the cost of solar Trends in Oregon that somebody put a link to in the chat if that's helpful for that conversation and then we'll just sort of sit in awkward silence so just in case we get any hands raised or any more um comments it looks like the link didn't work let me try something and see if I can open it by cutting out some of the extra pieces there Carolyn they're talking about the link a Energy Trust report on the cost of that sort of aimed to take a look at the impact of rebates yeah I was able to access it by cutting out that Chrome piece so I'll put a clean Link in here that worked for me all right so just checking in it's still not see any new hands up up so you want to get back on and please let me know if I'm oh yeah I'll show you I'm so sorry to belabor to this point but I think the information that in the industry and Energy Trust of Oregon uh has provided is interesting but again doesn't answer the doesn't even ask the um what is the outcome of uh these rebates and how they impact costs because you know you would expect costs to decrease with time and economies of um and just to show that there's no increase doesn't um show that the rebate has uh no like doesn't have the unintended consequence of uh not getting to the end consumer I think in order to answer the question which is you just need to have a lot straw buyers like me who are considering solar and then Tesla there are some other larger companies that may not participate in the odoe's improved solar contractor list and then just compare like what's price competitive and um my hope is that you know now two years you know after I had searched um contractors are more price competitive but I think what you'll find is that um you know Tesla and large companies that have economies of scale are much more price competitive than kind of smaller contractors not to say that's not wrong to support local contractors and local businesses that have higher operating costs and don't have the same economies of scale but again I think it's following point two costs haven't gone up therefore the program is not um padding contractor bottom lines I I think that that data does not support the conclusion that's implied um because I think I can even today if I were to look at solar and storage from Tesla I doubt there's single contract in the Portland metro area that can beat that cost even with these incentives thanks for continuing to advocate for this I don't want to be in the position of Defending it or not or whatever so um but I will just say thank you for continuing to share the thoughts and I think there's some more chats um that you seem to be reading just fine so um maybe just one on",

        "text": " a future council meeting as well but that gives you just a kind of an overview of the timeline and wally adams is the project lead for this any questions on that before i move to the next one the next update is the nolan hills wind power project so on tuesday of this week we issued the draft proposed order the project is a combination facility which includes 340 megawatts of solar or uh wrote that down wrong i think it's 300 feet maybe 340 megawatts of wind 260 megawatts of solar i may have flipped that and 120 megawatts of battery storage the facility is proposed in northwest umatilla county uh nolan hills wind llc is the site certificate or applicant they are a subsidiary of capital power so the draft proposed order public hearing will occur at the next council on thursday may 26th starting at 5 30 p.m and that will be at the red lion in pendleton and kate sloan is the project lead for that project so we sent that to council as well so all of the details associated with the dpo are available to you as well as the application materials are all on our website any questions before i move to the other next project next one is the statelined wind project we just received the request for amendment number seven so the project is an operational wind energy facility consisting of two geographic units state line one and two and van sickle two state line one and two is composed of a hundred and six 186 turbines with a peak generating capacity of 123 megawatts and then ben sickle two unit consists of 45 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 119 megawatts the project is located in north umatilla county the certificate holder is nextera energy resources llc so amendment number seven is specific to the van sickle two unit the 45 turbines uh if you recall council recently approved amendment number six to re-power that facility and battery since that approval the certificate holder has reevaluated some of the specifications associated with the repowering um and has determined that they need to make some changes related to the minimum above ground blade tip clearance and the hub height associated with those wind turbines that were approved for re-powering under amendment 6. so it's really if they had known that during amendment 6 they could have included that because but because there's some alteration um it is really just sort of a continuation of amendment 6 if you want to think about it that way and we just received well along with that amendment request they have requested type b review as well so we have uh the amendment determination request and we since we just received those we are just beginning to evaluate them sorry gotta move a little bit my lights are going off there we go sorry about that um okay uh there's a oregon public utility commission rulemaking that we wanted to make you aware of on march 31st the oregon puc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for changes to its rules regarding certificates of public convenience and necessity so these are typically referred to as cpcns and these are included in their rules at oregon administrative rule chapter 860 division zero two four so a cpcn is an additional approval needed for the construction of an overhead transmission line that condemnation of land so if all of the land owners where the transmission line are going to go are willing sellers of an easement then a cpcn would not be needed but if there landowners who are not willing to provide that easement to enter into an agreement with whatever the company is to provide that easement then the cpcn is what grants that sort of condemnation authority so well it doesn't grant condemnation authority but it serves as evidence in a condemnation proceeding that the transmission line is public use and necessary for public convenience so sort of a step to allow the utility go through that those condemnation so the proposed rule changes revise and expand requirements for filing a cpcn they clarify and distinguish the review criteria and clarify the process that the puc will use to ensure that the pros proposed transmission line will be in compliance with statewide planning goals and so specifically for the proposed rules provide that the puc will accept a cpcn petition while the council's review of an application is ongoing but will not take final action until a council has issued a site certificate so to kind of explain that a little bit um you know our process takes some time the cpcn process takes some time and and then ultimately if they want to go through those eminent domain proceedings those take some time so the proposal is prior to the conclusion of a site certificate by fsec that the utility could start the process with the puc because again it takes some so it gets them ahead of the process but the puc won't conclude because i think one of the issues there is there's no guarantee what the conclusion of the council will be and so they certainly issue a cpcn prior to fsec decision because they don't know what ultimately would be approved or denied uh based upon an fsec site certificate so this is these rules haven't been looked at for some time and that's why the public utility commission is looking at them now so next tuesday the 26th the poc will hold a special meeting to discuss the rules um and then later on i believe at 1 or 1 30 that day they will have a public hearing they will also have a second public hearing on may 24th and then the last day to provide comments will be june 7th so if council members are interested in learning more about this we'd be happy to put an agenda item on so we can walk through this in a little more detail that i'm providing today but if you are interested in that please let us know and like i said we can we can add that agenda item and walk through a little more detail as to what the proposals are anyone have any opinions on that at this time this is chair grill this is hanley i'd like to see it on our agenda for may yeah this uh this this is cindy sorry no um and i agreed like it on the agenda and i just want to make sure that i'm clear on it so the puc process really doesn't have any impact on our process that our process has impact on the on what the puc is doing is that um well i would say for the cpcn that is a correct uh evaluation but but i would make um alter a little bit the question uh because um so for a transmission line like boardman hemingway we have a need standard council has a need standard for transmission lines and pipelines so in order for there are two two standards that a transmission line could meet to meet the need standard is the lease cost plan rule and then the second is the system reliability rule the lease cost plan rule essentially the rules allow for council to rely upon determination by the public utility commission that the project is needed so that's paraphrasing a little bit and sort of minimizing it so so for mormon hemingway as an example one of i mean they've made arguments that they meet both of those rules but they're relying upon integrated resource plan that they have approved by the oregon public utility commission which says the boardman hemingway project is you know effectively probably not approved is not the right term but acknowledged for construction in the irp for the pc that allows us to use to rely upon that as uh justifying that that's that particular uh standard is met or at least that portion of the standard is met so there is some integration between us and the oregon puc where you know they go first we go second they go third and so these all kind of interrelate and maybe during our may presentation we can walk through that um part of it a little more clearly as well thank you hopefully that wasn't uh too confusing the way i described marcy this is halloween yes neily todd um i thought i think you mentioned that part of the rule changes proposed by the puc is compliance with the statewide planning goals are they going to depend on us to do that evaluation uh no um i don't know maybe chris if you want to chris has tracked this rule making a little more than i have i don't know if you have a response to that chris if i don't have a good response to that right now um council member james can you just maybe something be prepared to talk to that in more detail in may yeah council member jenkins i can say i believe that their rules already um require the puc to find compliance with the statewide planning goals before they issue a cpcn uh for an upset jurisdictional facility they would be relying on the site certificate to demonstrate that under i think both the existing and the current and the proposed rules for local jurisdictional they're they're they currently rely on land use approvals issued by the county and i think there are some changes to the proposals and how that works um in this rulemaking i think one of the can one of the issues that they're struggling with is some counties require all landowners to be signatories to the application in order for a project to move forward and so that puts the utility a little bit in a bind if not all the land owners have signed on to the application they're trying to resolve that catch 22 is can that project move forward you those signatures from a local uh you know on the local land use application and then are they going to be in a position to make a determination of compliance with lane use goals versus say a county or city who in their language decision effectively has you know made that determination of compliance because you know assuming that they approve a transmission line you know their lane use ordinances you know if not you know specifically then indirectly um are already in compliance with the goals so but we can address that a little more clearly and specifically when we come back in may and do that presentation all right and lastly is the may council meeting so i'd already brought this up a couple of times but the next council meeting is may 26th and this will be a hybrid meeting meeting it will be both in person and webex so as i mentioned that we'll be conducting the draft proposed order for",

science this is the first time you're hearing with of them um maybe you've heard of them but you don't really know what they do you're somewhat familiar or um like me and Jen you've been living and breathing them for the past few okay thanks so much for filling that out looks like we've got the majority of folks who are somewhat familiar with all or one of them some folks that are new to them

glad to see that a majority is interested in finding out what programs will be administered by Odo because that is what we're going to spend the bulk of our time talking about and we'll give people 10 more seconds to fill this out thank you very much for participating in those polls it's really great for us to know who's in the audience and how to maybe tailor some of this webinar and then this will also be helpful as we go back and look at the recording and think about what we at Odo are learning during this webinar to see who's here and what your interests are all right next slide please and with this next slide I'm going to introduce Jen Center our federal federal grants administrator to talk about the scope of the funds coming our way great well thank you happy to be here today um so the federal funds that we're focused on in this webinar come from two different pieces of legislation um first there was the infrastructure investment and jobs act which was passed with bipartisan support in November of 2021 and this legislation focuses our on our nation's infrastructure and it funded more than 380 distinct Federal programs across multiple federal agencies on some of those programs happen to be related to our Energy and then the second piece of legislation the inflation reduction Act was passed using a process known as budget reconciliation on a partisan basis his legislation passed through as part of this process and as a result of that it was focused primarily on taxing and spending provisions and so what that means is as a result some of the inflation reduction act techs is limited to to pretty much focusing on the direct funding rather than how exactly these programs will be rolled out and as a result of that we are still waiting on quite a bit of guidance from different federal agencies particularly under the inflation reduction act as they work to fill in the gaps left behind us as a result of that streamlined text process that was needed by Congress in order to move this into law um I'll also note that the inflation reduction act focuses on health and medical programs and energy and climate programs and it uses a variety of tax measures and Grant programs so just to put these two pieces of legislation into context here is a slide that was prepared by RMI it shows the spending by federal agencies on these topics at different time periods the chart puts into perspective the moment in which we find ourselves you can see that the three pieces of legislation of the funding that's available is more than what would double that what that was available during the American Recovery and reinvestment act at this moment we're in the very early stages of ushering new programs and increased funding into our state agency but also into other eligible entities and Grant programs and financing um not all of this funding will flow through the Oregon Department of energy however different programs will have different eligible applicants and for example um we don't anticipate any funds from the chips and science act to be available to the state energy offices but the funds from that that particular law will likely support research for new or improved Technologies which will just Foster the energy environment in which we're working the available funding under these pieces of legislation will be program and purpose specific that's based on the federal law that authorized it beyond the specific programs we'll talk about more in depth later into this presentation I want to emphasize that there's a wide variety of funding opportunities to support energy and climate projects across all different types of applicants this slide highlights some of the opportunities available under the infrastructure investment and jobs act funding if you're",

including 112 sailors who were in a grave already in the United States in Arizona and considering that in Congress, President Felano Delano Cruzvel declared December 7, 1941 as a date that will live in infamy and whereas the events of that tragic day on the Hawaii Island of Oahu in per hbor propon America toward World War II and gave the nation a resolve that it had Victory and because of that Victory for democracy and the sacrifices they suffered in The United States has known that our enemies then are the allies of now and that is why, starting with Chris Ho, the mayor proclaimed December

        "text": " but not necessarily um things that need to be baked into rules um but just I I guess all of that summed up at a high level is really appreciate the the discussion here the way the agency is thinking about these rules and this Ru making um and also um everybody's Collective efforts to come up with ideas for making the process more yeah so just as I'm thinking about what I said and what what you guys uh appreciate all the comments um really do uh I just want to reiterate you know our goal our commitment is to fulfilling our kind of directive to the best of our ability and so to the extent that members of the public are able to help us do that and the process is confusing or is unclear uh or is structured in a way that makes that less likely to happen that's bad so if if somebody if a member of the public has information that would be helpful in making it a more you know better conditions or or to improve our process in some in any way um then we should figure out how to make that happen so I don't want I don't want to make it seem like uh you know I'm opposed to public support because I do think it's vital because you know the people who live in these areas who are aware could you know they are on the ground they're subject matter experts for you know the land around them and I do think they are very they're a critical resource and so we need to figure out how to tap that resource and how to ensure that those the the people who are affected by these projects are able to participate and provide meaningful part participation but that being said what what I what we don't want to do is design the rules in a way that allows people to effectively um wage war against projects or to prevent projects from going forward not because they fail to meet the standards uh but because they don't want the project to go forward and so uh I'm always you know looking at each Proposal with does this make the process more clear more efficient more effective or are we just making it easier for people to oppose projects they don't like simply because they don't like them so that's kind of the line that we're walking uh which is kind of can be a tricky one because sometimes uh you know what seems like efficient or or clear to one side will you know can be viewed as as doing the opposite Rudy you've got your hand up twice didn't know that was possible I don't know how I raised it twice super sorry about that two hands yeah all right so um this may be outside of the contested rulemaking process but I mean what I'm hearing from Jim and what I'm hearing from you all is there's this missing step of accessibility to the general public so has Odo or any other Oregon agency really done any surveys to find out how best to get information out to folks so there's this whole idea of messaging out are you are you saturating the affected areas or the affected communities with the information that these things are happening um so that's one that's one thing to throw out there and the other is um I'm not familiar enough with Oregon yet to understand if there's a plain language mandate I know that many things need to be translated into different languages but is there a language um obligation on Odo to put out materials in a way that people can any person could pick that up and run with it because I think what I heard in the last session was you know the the affordability of legal support being able to have attorneys um how do you get the public to know about what's happening and to understand it in clearer terms I know at some point there's diminishing returns because of the technical aspects and sometimes the legal aspects of these things but that opening of the door is that something that could be worked on on the Odo side of things or the FC side of things that's me I'll put both my hands down okay Jim let's he um just one point that I kind of wanted to bring out um between the notice of intent and the DPO that occurs that the public often is not pry to are we staff make discretionary decision with the applicant um for example in the case that I was in um because a transmission line was a linear facility the one mile rule was waved and a 1 half mile rule was put in place folks really were not aware of that a second instant is um around another case I'm in around by a lake in the county that's a park um the transmission line was put right next to it however staff allowed the applicant to use older BLM and Forest Service studies to determine the effect of the view on the individual where there were more current rules in place that superseded those old Rules by a number of years it's helpful if any decisions like that where staff are are deciding things that could be highlighted so that the public understands that's not a rule that's a discretionary decision by staff and the applicant to develop a methodology to measure something um in this case it was the um viewer's perception another instance was in the noise you know the the noise standards and how staff interpreted the rules but the public was not privy to that interpretation therefore able to raise the issue with sufficient spectiv because they didn't know what went on behind the scenes until too late so another long rendition sorry yeah that's that's a good point I do think it's uh we should we should always be thinking about ways of keeping the public in the loop because obviously if you're not familiar with what's how you know how things are going or how the proceedings go then you might not be able to it's it's going to make it more difficult to engage meaningfully um I think we have a lot of thoughts on this one uh I'm I I'm prepared to go to the next one I know we could probably spend two hours on this issue uh but it sounds like and I'm certainly if anybody has any additional thoughts and they want to uh you know send them to me outside of the rack on this on this issue I to as I as we start to work on the red line for this um you know feel free to do so um my takeaway is that you know there's there's more we can do to you know include to kind of think about the public as we Eng as we go through this process and how the decisions we're making and the complexity of the process could you know impact their ability to participate in this process and ways that we could potentially involve them in in sort of Outreach engagement uh so some things to think about uh let's move to let's move to number two here which is the idea the issues around being a of being a full or limited party member so uh again I'm gonna is do we know if Irene is on I haven't heard her speak uh I'm seeing some phone numbers on here I don't know who those folks um okay how do I speak oh you are on great I'm trying to figure out how to raise my hand too I've had the heck of a time I can't get through on my computer so I'm on the phone oh that's a bummer okay well I will I will pause to uh give you a chance to to comment and uh in L of you in L of you raising your hand uh because you did have concerns about each of these issues that we've raised um so go for go ahead Irene okay on the on the notice issue um I have several concerns one is that um people are not buying newspapers any longer and or very few of them and so um I'm wondering about how to get the notice out and perhaps one of the one of the suggestions that I have was to expand this would be a rural change expand the area notice because when you're talking about a maximum of a 500 foot notice people are directly impacted significantly beyond that and so it seems to me that a half mile notice to people who at least who are directly impacted would make a lot of sense or make more sense this has always been an issue of concern especially with the fact that um in particular in eastern Oregon there are a lot of us who have very poor computer uh access or many people have no computer access and they don't um take the paper so there is a real issue with notice problems um the other thing is when the notices do go out I think that oftentimes they are not clear as far as who is actually impacted or how they're impacted and one example I give you is when they send out notices there often times they will say things like you received this notice for one of four reasons and one of them might be because you're going to be affected by the noise from the development or uh you're on the mailing list or you know there'll be four or five different reasons why someone might get a notice and it doesn't say what the reason is so um there's no way for people to really know why it is they're receiving those not the general notice so that was a concern um just as far as notice I I agree with Jim that um there needs to be some way for people to get a more full explanation of the importance in particular of the the notice when or uh making comments because I don't think it clearly uh tells people that if they don't make a comment and they don't make a comment that meets certain specifications they are not allowed to have a contested case on their issue and um I mean may be arguments about whether or not that actually is the case but uh if you read over the notice and you know I can refer to the most recent one that um it doesn't really State what people need to comment on or what comments they need to make if they have a specific issue and so that brings in the whole thing about specificity and and U so I guess those are primarily my concerns with the with the notice I'll let somebody else go and try to figure out now how to how them raise my hand okay um so let's let's uh so we're on the than thank you for your comments definitely some some overlap in the concerns here about um kind of communication and reaching the public that we that we need to address so for this second one about um the nature of of party uh does anybody does anybody want to go to start on this one or have any thoughts about this uh issue I do go for it okay um the nature of party participation I think this is a this is a real stickler for for me in particular and I think for a lot of",

        "text": " but then i served as secretary of state for 11 uh nine years and then i served on the northwest power and conservation council so uh my life has really been very full of and energy and i hear and understand the concerns of the fishing industry i am a very very strong supporter of the development offshore wind and the reason i say that is because about 16 years ago i was trained to make presentations about global warming and since that time i've done presentations in oregon over 400 presentations to community groups about the impacts of climate change and that obviously ocean acidification and the fact that our oyster growers couldn't grow their oysters anymore where they used to because the ocean was changing because of the climate and so i when i look at this issue and i look at the concerns about the environment i some of those concerns but i have to tell you there's overwhelmed by the need to develop power and stop burning cold it's so clear what's happening if we just carry on to where we are and this offers us a real opportunity to develop a lot of really clean so i'm very supportive of a win and i'm also very supportive of you doing the studies to really try to minimize the impact clearly you're not going to eliminate the impact we know that but the benefits of reducing climate change are really important and you need to look at those when you're looking at trade-offs and impacts so thank you very much for your time it's a real pleasure to be here and i hope look forward to a mini year process so thank you very much thank you so much for your comments and for your home service so you can find your next person to speak is that correctly thank you my name is katie einman and and i'm currently president of citizens for renewable a local organization 501c but prior to that it was known as citizens against and i'm proud to say that we were able to stop um with our efforts and many others the foreign coal energy for this area the reason i bring that up is because it's by hearing that the bolton being treated as the all-embracing dental agency that's going to do it wants to be despite global input and i just want you to know that um we felt that way about ferp the federal energy respiratory commission that had never denied a fossil fuel project that came before it and even though they um approved it and initially denied it but then they eventually approved it it was defeated because of the state coastal management program and because of local language laws and this data funnel the state operates the clean water clean up clean care act so there's a lot of opportunity for the state to weigh in on the full process here just like we did on george cove so for all the people that feel this date is a waste of time and we don't we can't defeat ball that is just absolutely false we did it and if you want to do it again you may be able to do it i on the other hand have an open mind about when dinner i think it's very important that we speaking personally that we develop renewable energy and i hope that we can address all the concerns and all the concerns of the fishing industry and you know i'm concerned for marine mammals and birds all of that can be addressed because we can't share information learn and find big requests we all keep an open mind towards this process and know that and have confidence if we speak loud enough our concerns will be addressed addressed in a way that um may not work for everybody but it works for the that then and of all so he's been held on the planet survived i know we're over time that um the casino staff has assured us that we can stick until we hear um all the comments of those of you who are interested we have a thank you for casino stuff and early thank you um now for that okay thank you um i'm going to go to brian's bishop are you still you breath making his way um and i don't think we have anything in the chat but christy let me know what we do after brent good evening thank you for being here for the presentation i appreciate you being on coming down to the coast uh i'm brenda shaw i'm the uh here representing coos curry electric cooperative we serve electricity to all of curry county and rural portions of coos county and i appreciate that the reward acknowledges the the benefit for the electrical energy resilience here on the south coast of oregon we are dependent on the bonneville transmission system to bring energy to the south coast and in the event that there is there is a catastrophe being wildfire or earthquake that interrupts those transmission lines then we have the potential on the south coast to be without electricity for weeks and months and so with regard to offshore wind i would encourage them to report include the need for black start capability typically wind turbines need an energized grid to connect to in order to be able to generate electricity and put electricity on the system and so the capability for what we call the lacks in the industry is something that would be would need to be included as a part of that and so it would mean it would be significant value to the south coast capability in in kind of a disaster scenario where the transmission system disabled coming from bonjour power the other comment that i have is i was glad to see that the report acknowledges the need for a regional transmission organization that is not just a need for the benefit of this to integrate offshore wind but an immune renewables across the northwest the northwest is one of few regions in the united states that doesn't have an rto and rto is is significant is is important in developing the transmission system and in ensuring that the transmission system can meet the needs of of society as our energy needs and our energy desires for renewable and clean energy grows so i would encourage that in the report that it continues to emphasize the need for the regional transmission organization and that oregon department of energy will be a key player in in supporting development of a regional rto thank you thank you so much friend i wanted to um also queue up shannon souza and then um after that i have natalie rancher you want to get queued up after shannon i've stated okay thank you so much um so then after uh shannon and i have go ahead thank you um shannon susan speaking on on behalf of myself today i wear many hats but i'm just speaking as a coastal resident um first of all i wanted to thank you for coming here and and let everybody know that when this bill passed this it didn't come with any money so we asked the agency and many others did to take on additional tasks and additional to those that they already had and didn't give them any additional resources and in spite of that they have been fulfilling their mission um and exceeded it within coming to the most in person at personal and agency expense for this meeting so i wanted to thank you all for your efforts i wanted to um also note that there are so many moving pieces and so many studies and there are many of us in various organizations trying to help me collaborate to problem solve one of those pieces that we've heard a lot about tonight is the socio-economic impact the net socio-economic impact what are the negative impacts to our existing commerce such as our sustainable seafood fisheries um and what are some of those new opportunities also what are some of the strategies that we might employ and we look at different scenarios for build out to minimize those negative impacts and multiply the other impacts to that effect um we have worked together to develop an extensive scope of work um and as well as a budget to address that around our planning goal just as a planning scenario for three gigawatts of offshore wind we have not been today successful in attracting state funding to collaborate however our neighbors to the north in have leaned in and accepted us they are recognizing that our inexpensive hydroelectric system is increasingly taxed both by the additional loads we are placing on it and the changes of the climate and how it operates and the additional stresses on the fisheries there with respect to that they see offshore wind off of their shore potentially in the future they also acknowledge the potential values of renewable hydrogen in the pacific northwest so they have included that scope of work in a preliminary budget university of washington board of seattle port of tacoma have all needed with support i mentioned this as an open invitation for any that would like to get together with me we are in the final scoping process for that because we will uh fleshing that out for the full federal um buildback better grant notification so is there any in the crowd that would like to talk about that scope and budget please do along those same lines we've been listening to the concerns that have been aired extensively and by many voices about the golden process about a potential lack of transparency and a lack of understanding about the metrics about how hierarchies and decisions are we've reached out and have found that there are other agency resources that could be brought to bear the work that dlcd has done in oral way map is above and beyond the call of duty really rising to the challenge and exemplary work it could be complemented as we move forward through the space again with our neighbors to the north and washington moving forward by the work that noaa sciences not nymphs but noaa sciences has been doing in marines racial planning it seems to meet some of those objectives of additional transparency both in the data sets um as well as and one more piece is i hope that you will following back to my opening and the lack of resources i heard a question about will there be additional regulatory resources brought to bear as any of these projects go forward and would like to offer us another tool that might be mentioned in your report that as we are facing the biggest infrastructure investment federally that we will probably ever see in our that we include our intellectual infrastructure and that includes your minds and your staff and the analytical tools that our planning agencies and our agencies have brought to bear we find that those are comparative because we don't know what to build um if we don't have the tools and the resources that's all i have thank you thank you um tim where are you still here and then um harry silva nick edwards my name is carrie silva i've stood alongside my husband john in the fishing industry for 40 years",

        "text": " support required moving to the next slide so this lays out for you the fact that the number of street lights and tax lots and assessment areas is in keeping with the growth we've seen in the last few years uh in in the the slide you'll see that we're looking at 12885 street lights are part of the service districts there's 48,1 145 tax Lots which is property owners who are impacted and there are 1,286 assessment areas so every year we look at one particular assessment area and make sure the costs for that assessment area are being borne by that area also I want to say that uh most uh Property Owners typically pay somewhere between 20 to $30 a year for this service it's not a large cost and when it's set up uh the maximum cost they would pay is initially set up to be double the initial cost so every once in a while we get to where the actual costs have caught up to that maximum cost and we have to have another hearing to reset what that maximum cost will be we have such hearings every year and you'll be having some hearings to that effect uh next month as well because that continues to happen the Board of Commissioners will the Board of Commissioners will thank you um so yes if the projected costs will be exceeding the maximum a public notification goes out to the impacted property owners and there's going to be a hearing and it'll be required by the board to be approved this slide shows the previous year's actuals and the budgeted uh revenues and expenditures we're looking at revenues of a little over $3 million and expenditures of just about $2.7 million and a contingency projected to increase up to 1, 263,000 I I'd like to point out that the the challenge to this budget and I think to most every budget is largely driven by the electric bill bill rates which have been climbing recently and we try to predict what that increase will be but we don't always hit the mark exactly uh we do need to have a contingency on hand because revenues come in via the property tax bills in November and we got to pay all the costs and expenses from the period of the beginning of the fiscal year until the property tax revenues start showing up in November so that's what we're using this contingency for also because this is build via property tax bills our collections are subject to the compression of property taxes as part of measure five which throws a little bit of a variable into we need this much money but we only get this much money and predicting that is is a less than exact science can I ask a question while we're on it here or you may want to hold answering my question till the next slide um I'm seeing um news media report rep that Portland General Electric has doubled the electricity bill in general and I'm wondering if this the amount that you're budgeting is going to be able to absorb an increase like that I don't think our budget's anticipating a doubling of our electric costs and I could try to get back to you about what percentage increase we are expecting but I'm fairly certain we're not building into this a doubling but also I believe those rates are you have different rates for different kinds of customers so some customers may be facing a doubling but street lights might not be facing the same kind of increase terrific thank you and so it might be good to have an identification of what kind of rate we get but I'm fine with moving forward with this budget rate thank you and um chair Harington to your question I anticipate that we are looking at something around a 25% increase this year that is a substantial bump but again that that's based on discussions that our staff have had with PGE looking forward about potential rate adjustments that they may be proposing so trying as you say to get a little bit ahead of that curve better than double it's much better than double and also I wanted to point out that while some Property Owners might be seeing a significant percentage increase in their bill it's usually a pretty low dollar increase somebody's Bill might go from $25 to $32 which would look like a huge percentage increase but it tends to be a pretty small number of dollars in somebody's larger property tax and we are hoping that in the coming years the contingency is going to start to level off a little bit I think we've been trying to rebuild a contingency level to that which we're hoping to have and we're getting closer but I don't think we're quite there yet thus the increase in the rates slightly higher than the increase in budgeted expenditures and I'll I'll just say too as a uh former homeowner in the Bethany area that was covered by the service district for lighting uh having those street lights all throughout my neighborhood made helped make me feel safer in my neighborhood than the darkness that otherwise would have prevailed so I think this is a pretty well-received service and and I appreciate the fact that we've built into the process uh requirement that most people who are impacted support it because we do have some areas where somebody ask for a street light but most of the neighboring property owners for whatever reason like to be in the dark and that's okay and so it this is a self determining process here and people tend to get what they're hoping to get from this process um I don't have much of a update for this slide this slide's about um an initiated added District or or service area from the previous year but it gives you an idea of where this might be and how many properties would be affected and how many street lights would be a part of one of these neighborhood initiated services and these are the ones that we see as part of the annex annexing into these different districts as part of uh ugb expansion areas that are now being developed with new neighborhood applications right right and even even within the older parts of the urban growth boundary when land divisions happen to create a new a new development they're required to Annex into the district and to provide Street lighting development and we also provide um on request light Shield for some people we've been doing a big conversion to LED lights and some people are asking for light Shields which reduce the uh undesired glare in particular areas but it's a relatively low cost and this program's been going along pretty well um the that 150 onetime charge or yes it's a onetime charge an installation charge and that's my presentation questions I was wondering if you could talk to us about what are some energy saving initiatives either in your District or just countywide that can help reduce the burden of the electricity grid and you know where I don't know who funds these programs if it's state or County I'm just curious to if you can talk about where there are initiatives to either use more energy from other sources than you know buying it Off the Grid that that come in from you know I uh that's a great question I I would I can address perhaps the the things that we're doing on the county side for sure are in terms of our efficiency of the fixtures the LED conversions we've been partnering with PGE for probably six or seven years now working through that process we're getting really close I think either this year or in this upcoming budget year completing that transition so the vast majority of our street lights will now be LEDs so the power usage is way way lower like 20% of what it used to be so that's been a big Improvement in that regard and then I think there may be a larger question that we couldn't answer from our perspective just about broader initiatives around um increasing efficiency or looking at as you say other alternative sources for electricity but PG certainly is uh uh right there trying to also do this do the same thing in terms of just um reducing their Reliance on fossil fuel and I want to also point out there's an ADD benefit with the conversion to the LEDs beyond the reduced electric draw they also have a much longer lifespan which reduces the amount that is being spent on maintenance and replacement that thank you that's very helpful to understand and is there any um use of solar on the lighting that maybe draws the energy from the you know solar power or use of um electric batteries I've heard of stories where after um usage in electric vehicles the batteries from the cars can be used to power things like street lights because the batteries still have a longer useful life of maybe another 10 years so I'm just wonder if you're looking into those options as well I'm going to say no that is that sounds very Jetson likee to me but but I no I appreciate where you're going with that that's a really interesting uh topic for us to be thinking about my understanding right now is at the at the scale that we're working at the battery power limited ations are still going to be somewhat challenging and the dis the distributed nature of the street lighting system what may make that a little bit complicated but I do think that as the technology continues to evolve those are certainly things that we'll be wanting to take a look at thank you I have a question how long does it take from the time that somebody makes a request for street light to win that's approved and to whenn it's implemented that yeah that can also vary yeah and I would think it's in the order of months I don't think this is a particularly long process I don't think it takes a year um but I would have to ask staa about that process when she gets back if that's okay yeah so do you have much of a backlog of requests right now I think she's got a request or two that she's working on but I wouldn't say that there's ever a backlog okay thank you any other questions or discussion for scl1 thanks Mr Adams Mr Roberts thank you so the next thing on the agenda would be public hearing but we had some more discussion or questions about sdl we do sdl number one first and then and then we do Washington count budget second do you want to call for a motion oh so there's two motions yes okay so the one is in front of you own District if you're ready to receive it I'll make it for you yeah we need oh first okay all right so we're ready for for public hearing forl one okay um turn over to Quick Moss thank you chair Everton this is now the time for a public hearing on the service district for lightning budget does anyone in the auditorium Wish by public comment on the presentation as you've heard from our land use and",

        "text": " so if you're interested in following any of these studies or taking part in supporting oregon department of energy and implementing these studies there's an option to get involved with these projects on the oregon department of energy website going into the sections of the bill that actually established this grant program it's at the end of the bill starting with section 29 and we are grateful to have a bill that gives us a clear kind of purpose which has not always been a part of every incentive program in oregon so the bill states that the purpose of the is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy and so that is the stated purpose of program as it reads in the bill and i think it does a pretty good job of laying out what's trying to be done here and so with that in mind they reinforce it in a few ways one way that they kind of reinforce that is to have specific budget carve outs and there are two budget carve outs referenced in the bill and the first is that 50 or more of grants are to be awarded for planning or developing community renewable energy projects that qualify as energy resilience projects so there's a focus to spend at least or to issue grants at least half the grants going for projects that enhance energy resilience in the introductions we talked almost exclusively about energy resilience projects but this bill is actually describes a program that can fund just a straight renewable energy project that maybe doesn't have specific energy resilience components and so those projects are also welcome to participate in the program but 50 or more of the grants are to be awarded to those projects that do have that resilience component and then the other carve out is that 50 or more the funds are going to be for grants to be awarded for planning or developing community renewable energy projects that primarily serve one or more qualifying communities and this term qualifying communities is used in the section of the bill that describes our program but it points back to a definition in the in the opening definitions of the bill back in section one and so qualifying communities environmental justice communities and that's defined again in the opening section of the bill it includes communities of color communities experiencing lower incomes tribal communities rural communities coastal communities communities with limited infrastructure and communities traditionally underrepresented in public processes and adversely harmed by environmental and health hazards including seniors youth and persons with disabilities and so this is a pretty broad and open definition here and you'll see when we start looking at the questions that we're really hoping that we can work with all of you to help us be able to projects that are coming into the as as meeting these environmental justice community goals and be able to ensure that the funds go um to the right communities in oregon so it's one of the um one of the parts of the bill that i think if you if you did see those questions we sent out on friday that we're looking for some guidance on another thing that makes this program kind of unique is that for the first time with oregon department of energy at least we have a program that is only eligible for public bodies that is these public bodies and consumer-owned utilities are the only eligible applicants for the so that includes tribes counties special government bodies such as special districts consumer owned utilities the pictures on this slide here are from the grid edge demonstration project that was completed by and this was a few years ago now but for those of you who aren't familiar with this project and i think many if not all of you probably are but this is a project where they have 50 kilowatts of solar on the roof of a school and that solar is used to some on-site storage and that on-site storage can be used to turn that school into an emergency and also to operate a municipal potable water pump and so this is a project that has a lot of the the moving parts that we like to see in a resilience projects where we see energy teamed up with some other piece of critical critical infrastructure in this case shelter and drinking water and it is done at this kind of community level maybe has some operational advantages and that they have water and energy under one roof and so they're able to coordinate kind of seamless seamlessly between those two sectors but it's really an exemplary project it's a project that taught us all that these these are pretty complicated projects at times and that they can be costly and challenging from an engineering standpoint but when they're completed they really do bring a lot of extra value to communities this is how we kind of envision the grant process taking place within the and we have two simple flow diagrams here that describe the construction grants and the planning grants that are likely to apply for this program and it all starts with an opportunity and we'll look a little little closer at those in the next slide that will lead us to applications from tribes and municipalities and communities across oregon that application will then undergo an eligibility review within oregon department of energy to ensure one that it's a complete application and two that the applicant is eligible under the guidelines in the bill at that point all of those projects that are complete and eligible will move on to a competitive review you know in a scenario where we have more projects than we have funds for that competitive review will be in place ensure that the the best projects are getting the money and this is where we're gonna look at kind of the priorities for how these projects get scored in that competitive review and again that's something we look at pretty closely in the questions later in the meeting those projects that are selected by competitive review will be enter into a performance agreement with oregon department of energy that performance agreement will enable them to start the project and everything that's in this sort of dotted line is the construction phase of a project and that project gets odo will conduct a final review and an on-site inspection and upon the completion you know successful completion of those reviews we'll issue a grant payment the planning grants are a little simpler and the process is very similar but the nature of planning grants is that they won't need an on-site inspection and so that's the only piece that is different from a from a schematic we also anticipate that these planning grants will take less time to complete than some of the more complicated construction grants and the bill reflects that by giving construction projects three years and planning projects one year to complete with the ability for odo to establish in rules some reasonable extensions for those the bill describes four different opportunity announcements two of the opportunity announcements will be for planning grants and those are further divided between those that are for energy resilience projects and those that are for renewable energy only so those will be separate opportunity the maximum grant for planning projects is a hundred thousand dollars and the maximum percentage of cost for a planning grant is up to 100 of the project cost for the we will also be issuing two opportunity announcements related to construction again these are divided between energy resilience projects and renewable energy only projects for these the maximum award will be one million dollars and for the energy resilience projects we are again able to fund up to 100 percent of project cost for the renewable energy only projects were able to fund up to 50 percent of project costs and um so that's that's what the opportunity announcements are going to look for look like and the maximum awards and percentage of costs that can be covered according to the bill these grants will be awarded on a competitive basis that was that competitive review square in the flow and they will include performance agreements and these performance agreements will include all of those sort of plans in the application phase that are declared by the the community applying for the grant to ensure that when the the project is completed that um that we've met all of the objectives that were laid out in project application the timeline for the program we started some internal work implementing this program in the summer and moving into the fall established advisory committee that's a big check to have completed that one now we're into this phase of sort of program design and moving into september october november that's when we're really focusing on program rules and really the early stage of that was this committee on board and this is our first of the rule making meetings and so we hope to have draft rules put together this fall and with your help we want to get those those those rules put together before the end of the year so that we can follow all of the required public comment periods for and have those rules in place for the launch of the program which we anticipate to be march of 2022 that's when we want to issue the opportunity announcements so it may not look that fast for for some but for building a whole new program writing rules and getting a fair number of new staff brought on board at oregon department of energy this is actually a very aggressive so this is what we are striving to to do which is to get those opportunity announcements out in march moving on this will be a kind of an orientation for roles of this committee and again this is a work in progress and we hope to get input from from all of you for how this advisory committee operates throughout the run of this program so this is just a kind of a closer look at how the advisory committee fits into that timeline that we just looked at and here we are in october and really through february we're going to be doing this rule making and you will serve as a rules advisory committee or iraq which is a common term um for oregon rule making committees so we're hoping to get your input and feedback to adopt some rules we're hoping that we're hoping you all share ideas and advice for definitions and methodology so that we can get this these program rules put together to really honor the intent of the bill we're really going to get into when we write the rules this is the this is where we codify all of the details for the program and so we are looking for really the detailed level of program design in the rules and um so we're hoping that we get really good feedback in this meeting in the next meeting i think there i will pause for a moment because i believe that nick has joined i was just prompted let me see i don't actually my list may not show but nick are you have you joined us yeah i think that he might be",

        "text": " top of my head right now but check it out okay um I think I'll move us to the next slide lots of really great ideas and comments and just because I'm not saying them doesn't mean they're not great we'll make sure we take a close look comments and then rebates will also this is the next question rebates will also support the economy and jobs such as contractors who will install energy upgrades how can Odo use these funds to meet the US doe goal of supporting minority-owned and woman-owned and Veteran owned businesses and then thanks Emily for once again posting the link for folks to either raise their hand answer in the chat or um there's a form where you can provide us answers to all of these or any of these questions and get back to us that way with that I'll see if any hands come up and otherwise feel free to continue to add things to the chat for us to review in the detailed fashion later and cover a little bit now yeah I'll just jump in I saw a question someone asking if this is this is separate from the Oregon State rebate so yes we are right now talking about the the federal rebate programs that are coming to the state that are not established yet there are existing um state level programs that we talked about that are open now or will be opening sooner than than these programs and you can find information about those on our on our website we can um provide a link to some of those state level programs that are coming great yeah I can do that now uh clay you can go ahead in just a second okay clay go ahead oh clay maybe didn't mean to have his hand up again I'm not sure what happened but I think we're good all right we have a question about aren't a lot of heat pumps well over 8,000 so even if eligible for the full amount it would not cover that piece any thoughts on that um I can speak to the price of heat pumps yes um if you're looking at a comprehensive um heat pump system that covers your whole home um often they are well above that $8,000 range um a smaller installation that would maybe just provide heating and cooling for like partial load of the space would be under that but as well noted um to be eligible for the here program you would need a heat pump to be the primary heating uh source for heating and cooling source for your home so um yes in many instances the total cost is going to be higher than the rebate cap and then I'll just add on to that and clarify that we have no control over that rebate cap so that's set by the federal department of great all right and some people are answering that question in the chat as well uh somebody's bringing up avoiding the mistakes of the ARA grants where new contractors were encouraged so strongly and a lot of those companies kind of struggled so a note there um from one person on that mostly though doesn't seem like folks have a lot of comments unless they're um on this question unless they're just still writing longer answers so we can maybe move on to the next one but please know you're welcome to complete your answer in the chat o clay you're back back clay you're here your hand is up again are you ready to go now yeah pardon me I was pressing a bunch of buttons that I I was trying to anyway unmute myself go back a slide because I think Clay's got a comment on the last slide and then we'll and then this may already be you know your your uh approach for solicitations however ensuring that you're requesting some percentage of uh uh a proposed project with an RFP solicitation to include a percentage of uh you know disadvantaged business spend whether it's through a subcontractor or the prime itself I don't I don't know if that actually hits on this particular requirement uh however that that's my cents thanks Clay all right we'll go to the next slide now thank you all right um um us doe gives this oh we've talked about retroactivity a fair amount I guess just the question here is what consideration should we take into account as we design this program around the um technical Logistics and the challenge to meeting Equity requirements if retro activity is allowed for the program interestingly the first comment here is if the point is to encourage action why would you provide incentives retroactively just sounds like a waste of money so that's that's to the point I think that is our concern that the money would go extra fast and maybe to people who had the funds to um to do the project versus if the program is intended to go to load of moderate income folks who wouldn't have that money to begin with oh thanks Zach just did my job for me so Zach malland thank you nice to see you by the way I'm just put in the link to our heat pumps and if the HVAC won't last until next spring then I think looking into the state programs that are launching imminently in most regions of the state would be a good place or thinking about the tax credit as possibly something to help make that um cool again not seeing just a ton of chatter or hands up on this um retroactivity question so feel free to go ahead and answer into the chat oh Clay's back all right clay let's let's hear it yeah to B to bolster Jeremy's statement that completely agreed reflect the the policy priorities is it Equity or or you know is the priority Equity or or getting the spent all right so next next slide um homes rebate amounts will not cover 100% of project costs and while stacking with other programs is possible it is likely that some of the project costs will need to be covered by the participant despite this do you have any recommendations and considerations for reaching justice 40 and other disadvantaged communities with this and again oh clay go ahead maybe it's time to continue advancing whatever bill that is uh with the state of Oregon for a green bank because that it's proving useful in California is one yeah I also see a note from Jeremy on this about targeting um rental housing and um targeting landlords who maybe do have some funds to contribute to projects um to try to reach the the number of um participants and projects in the Justice party communities that we're trying to reach and that's something that we have been looking at um as well as partnering with other um multif Family targeted programs um including some of the L heat programs that Target they have multif family um aspects and then um our utilities uh some of them also have multif Family Programs so thank you for that that's something that we have started to explore and on this one I'm also hearing about money for community- based organizations to help with Outreach it's a great idea and one we've been thinking about too um we did get a little bit of feedback on the retroactivity we most folks on retroactivity seem to be saying like doesn't really make a lot of sense but there is a concern about how customers sort of stopped installing waiting for this program to come online we are aware of that and we're hoping the state programs coming online will really help with that in addition to the tax credits but totally hear that concern and wanted to honor that because it's one we've also heard and also thought quite a bit about um and charity who's um on the line and is one of the state experts on this work we're really grateful that you've joined us today um talking about without 100% funding it'll be really hard to reach justice 40 requirements um so it could work in places like Portland where there's PF to help on the other side of it but that was her um somebody brought up longterm loans um collaborating with entities who have funds to stack absolutely um training on how to apply rebates would be helpful and charity brings up that cbos can do more than just Outreach they could even administer an entire install program like they're doing in Portland great press on community energy projects work in Portland this week um and then will there be funding for the question is will be there be funding for cbos to do this I think it's an option yeah yeah absolutely we are we are actively looking at whether or not this should be a primarily State administered program or whether we have Community Partners that have capacity to take on this work um whether that's through existing utility incentive programs through cpos or other organizations um and we have been working on starting to meet with those groups to hear from them about their interest and capacity to to join us in the effort to deliver this program um so absolutely want to continue hearing from you if you have specific suggestions of people we should be talking to on that front and then this is also a perfect place I meant to do it on the first one that talked about getting like stacking incentives um in the general category and then I forgot but the Energy Trust of Oregon question how will these programs work with existing programs and we've kind of answered that here and there that you know you can braid um you can or stack incentives in order to get to a higher rebate um the other thing I'll say with Energy Trust of Oregon how often are you all meeting with them on this program like every other week or something yeah I think every other week but consistent yeah yeah so um we you know for those who don't know Energy Trust of Oregon provide really similar programming to um something like 65% of the customers not they don't provide to every to 65% of the customers in the state like each one but the territory they serve reflects about 65% of the customers in the state and so they're a really important partner just like Oregon Housing and Community Services um folks like Community energy project I just mentioned charity folks like the cap agencies um that are doing this type of work we're really trying to make sure we work closely with everyone to figure out how to make these programs all work together so hopefully that's a more specific answer on etto that than we'd given in sort of the general earlier I'd be super curious I bet there's at least one person from etto on this call if not multiple um okay think actually has his hand up and great go ahead uh how do we want to do this it um good question Thomas I'm GNA handle that question first uh we met with General Managers from consumer and utilities recently and our plan is to actually hold a meeting with consumer owned utilities remember I mentioned this is like our kickoff we're doing a couple meetings next week and then we're planning on doing Outreach to the consumer and utilities",

        "text": " utilities adopt one CBI for each of the following topic areas resiliency health and Community well-being environmental impacts energy Equity economic benefits so just alignment between these and then what the program priorities are for burgers Lane system there's been some conversation around that but yeah if anybody would like to come off from you um you're welcome to raise your hand and provide feedback virtually as well still Public Power or the investor and Utilities Fall um for large retailers we said it is the three items plus give it to one essay and Retail Academy West is that it depends still particularly something I think it's interesting something can you take Christina off mute for an opportunity to win it's beginning to wonder if it was functioning can you hear me clearly yes hi Christina hi this is Christina Medina calling in from Pacific Court thanks for the opportunity to kind of be in this space with you um we're very enthusiastic about any conversations around Community benefits particularly when we're talking about finding opportunities to calibrate and reach shared understanding um around them so you know I put in the chat some reference to some order numbers that really are a bit of our Guiding Light in the state of Oregon obviously they're they're born from HP 2021 and they're really elements that serve you know the clean energy plan and really making sure that once we adapt for the future that we are trying to mitigate any harmful impacts to the communities that we serve and so a good um amount of work for us here at the utility is really spent in creating those spaces for you know genuine and meaningful input from our customers and communities and through advisory groups and we've actually developed quite a few um and in those advisory groups we're able to kind of bring forward uh maybe some fundamental approaches in each one of these categories that we've listed here is cbis as a starting point by which we might build out um you know what might be a longer strategy to even more enhance and meaningful helpfulness what would be incredibly helpful is if there was a greater alignment from the the smaller facility groups that are not necessarily beholden to this legislation for them to actually kind of start to maybe see some of these cbis and see these areas because we are in in stakeholder groups where there's a significant Delta between you know what we're offering and delivering um so 50 cbis and what kinds of outcomes we're looking to deliver compared to basically what feels like no expectation or you know Municipal Utilities at this point and so we are having community members that are maybe receiving services from those municipals that are saying Hey I want to be a part of this system I want greater Equity I have some concerns I want to be a part of some of these things but they can be experience that type of equity so I think if we were to surface any opportunity I think that is one where we might have some level setting there and then two um with respect to the resilience topic which is obviously top of mind for many of us we clearly understand that there's a a real challenge with regard to you know communities living in The Last Mile climate impacts and other things air quality and whatnot but resilience hubs are obviously top of mind for a lot of communities we think there's some initiatives there in that space but um we start to have that conversation in the community we start off with the basics you know measuring outages the frequency and duration you start to build those into our maps and then we overlay census tract data and then also we start to include our own survey information so we're really starting to try to find ways to get enough enough of a lens to make a decision that's going to be more impactful and to Foster greater equity in their community so it's been it's been a great process for us it's challenged us to think outside of you know the norm collaborating or the past operating processes and systems and I think it's been really healthy it's challenged us to receive feedback from community members and try to understand whether or not it is something that can be used to be to force or drive an adaptation and the way we approach things and also it builds a I think a robust internal Community here at Pac where we have greater empathy and understanding for our customers for example we don't typically call them repairs anymore so we're very thoughtful about our approach with our communities and anyway it's part of a larger narrative so anything we can do to support the efforts here whether it be meeting separately to share some of our approaches we're happy to do it right about the ramble but it's an important topic for us I guess I might just give a Counterpoint on that you know we're not as cous we're not subject to the puc's oversight and um the community energy plan requirements of House Bill 2021 so you know our local governing boards work with our communities on these topics so um I guess I just offer that as a Counterpoint we're happy to look at you know some of the thinking that's going on over at the puc and we do on occasion um I would not want the department of energy to make um standards for this program comparable to what the ilus have to do because that that doesn't necessarily work for us so I just put that out there well I I would definitely I think the thing to keep in mind too is the scale um in comparing there's so much larger than they have the resources and they have capabilities and the staff to be able to do something which responsibility of wanting to do some of these programs for very small and we refer our numbers as members because they want us and we do calling rate wearers and also helps to remind us they're the ones with paying bills it's not meant to be negative it's easier when you're discovering good for a members customers to use it generalized from those terms but it's just it's just different it's you know Christina brings up a lot of great points and they're uh we probably do that so members that want to be involved and some of the things that may be like uh these very large believersion we just don't have a camera yeah it might be something we recognized and then we are working those reactions to to to to get better at that we don't fall we don't fall under the same guidelines either yeah I think I mean they go through a very rigorous process and in some cases the Ohio use Blazer Trail in California from you know it's important I mean as far as we in our local office Roseburg behalf of our one there worked here and vice versa and we're love working with regularly we've worked with your mom in San barter down in the rosary work with him for great folks I want to just we're just so I know that Gail Malcolm is with us and she had a really great project that I was hoping to hear from Gail and we'll move this along to get to the actual to other people okay so let's go over three more stories five minutes max and then we can move on this is Brooke can you hear me sounds good okay uh so I will drop into the chat um how PGE has taken a look at the cbis that Christina was talking about this is an iterative process so you know as we continue to engage with our community and the POC and other stakeholders this will continue to evolve but I think to the point that some of the cous we're talking about in terms of scale and scope and how do you operationalize that there are some good I think lessons in terms of you know some of the smaller things that may be able to be incorporated as smaller utilities are looking that aren't you know big large-scale Monumental things that take a lot of Staff time so I will drop that into the chat and just for kind of awareness purposes I wanted to briefly touch on the Workforce Development side of things and that's something that we've really taken as a priority for us and really looked at ways in which we can help build the workforce pipeline and really leverage you know the projects that we are doing so for projects obviously our own Workforce is doing some of the projects when we contract out we're looking at things like requiring prevailing wage and looking at Apprentice utilization thinking through ways in which we can partner with pre-apprenticeship programs we have our own pre-apprenticeship program for lineman and then looking at other Partnerships with other pre-apprenticeship programs so thinking a little bit broader Beyond just the actual project that you're working on but working in a more cohesive way for how we can build the workforce pipeline because that benefits community in a broader and a more long-term way so PGE also convened a Statewide Coalition last year around building the clean energy Workforce Coalition and I'm happy to follow up with anybody who would like more information on that we some of you uh on the call and in the room are participating in that but I'll put my information down as well so I just wanted to throw that little plug in about kind of thinking broader about Workforce broadly thank you bro yeah be right there can you guys hear us Stacy would it be possible to Pivot over to Gail and give her an opportunity to to speak to them on this hi I was hoping to be there in person but I ran into a car accident and I got turned around so I'm on the side of the road someplace safe so in terms of central Lincoln's um one of the projects we had thought about was something we call the cape perpetua project and it has it's a um a 14 Mile Stretch of distribution and fiber line that runs on the ridge above Highway 101 so it's it gets a lot of wind in the winter and um it's in the South National Forest and it's in the cape perpetua Scenic area and it's high up and to get to most of the sections of the line we have to helicopter in or get there by foot when we have an outage and we do have outages on that particular line because it's so so uh we're wanting to do a joint project with Pioneer who is also running um and uses our polls and and moving all that infrastructure down to Highway 101 um underground so it's an undergrounding project on its face but there's lots of community benefits and um first of all we'd be moving the distribution and fiber lines out of the national forest and the scenic area it returns where we do have roads it returns that habitat and public lands to its original use it eliminates the risk of wildfire and storm-related outages um it'll certainly enhance reliability of the",

components so for any time that there's a survey you survey the micro sighting areas and the other expanded site boundary because our definitions for analysis area are associated with the site boundary but we're satisfied with say under structural it's categorizing the structural uh you know hazards right like we're okay like do that with like desktop analysis right like fine with fine with that same thing with characterizing soils you can use just nrcs to go out there knock over a name plate um as I talk with my hands anyhow so I want to make that uh clear and that's another example that we just did so that's kind of being responsive to this issue so that said and as we talk about in the order in the DPO and will be in the proposed order there's an entire section where we talk about all of this we explained the basis the out but um the point is this Quest request doesn't it doesn't have a standard or a statute right this is this it's it's kind of evidence-based did Idaho Power present enough information into the record to support the analysis areas you know that they were properly evaluated for resources that we look at for each Council standard which all of that is presented in the draft propose order right to where we're going to be looking at like surveys Etc within the micro sighting areas and a bigger desktop analysis of the larger site boundary so we recommend that this you know is approved because it's it's a it's a information did they provide the information like everybody else did and they didn't we're recommending that they do I'm going to pause there I have another like a process like talking about the amendment determination um review issues raised associated with that on my next slide does council want to talk about this at all or anybody's comments councelor berer chair how if I might um so site boundary we do expanded site boundary we do um a desktop analysis if any for resources that we have standards for then within the new the new microing area we would do more detailed surveys if required so say within the new micro sighting area that some protected resource shows up which it shouldn't because we've already done a preliminary study area presumably um would there be any new conditions that would be triggered by that or well that's kind of what we look at with this which is interesting you know on whe whether not not this these changes in the additional micro sighting areas by definition necessitated an amendment but we didn't change any all of our existing conditions capture anything that would be found in any of these areas so you know no and I'm I'm just like and Sarah you can I don't yeah we didn't change anything I'm looking over Sarah for the people on the phone we not with respect to anything found in for the rfa2 uh yeah condition Yes except that the Nuance there is that we are also proposing to change the t&amp; mitigation conditions but that's less so because of this instance and more so because of ongoing coordination with um Department of a uh plant program and the certificate holder and just figuring out a better um a better better mitigation frankly something that's actually going to really like work better for everybody including the plants so yeah um so yes but you're you're you're spoton with um oh oh I know what the other thing was uh so because and this was also very blendy with the um con you know like with the position um like whether or not we're going back and looking at the uh the approved facility and opening it up which we agreed we aren't we we can't not by the rules here I just have pulled up this is your uh structural condition and you can see here that the change is I struck out site boundary and I said my and we're adding in micro sighting area um and so in a sense this does apply to everything if approved it would be rfa2 rfa1 and ASC so in a way it's every it applies to everything but all this edit is doing is tying this back to the areas that are surveyed all this is saying is you are not serving that huge expanded area out to the yellow like that is a ridiculous amount let's go back to Wheat Ridge is it 74,000 or 14,000 which I'm sorry 14,000 Acres still a lot to survey for everything but whatever that's up to them um so over here all we're saying is rather than doing your in that instance of that condition which is the the Geotech work you don't have to do it out to that big site boundary but you do have to do it in applicable places in those micro sighting areas whichever micro sighting area you choose you got to do the survey so any condition change that where we made we struck out site boundary and put in micro sighting area it just like it doesn't increase or decrease change what is surveyed the same area we're just calling it something different so that's what those changes mean and there were comments raised on these changes so that's all it means it's uh because we're separating these two originally in the application rfa1 micro sighting area equal to typ boundary we're now separating what those areas look like and so we're just making it evident that you know the original area micro sighting area is what would need to be surveyed okay so then so now we're you know and IA hope power um Mr stipple at the in the response to comments at the hearing you know talked about um well you know citing a transmission line is hard right um you're working with land owners you're trying to avoid resources there's noise impacts there's Sage GRS there's protected areas there's utility corridors there's agricultural pivots it's not easy it's not an excuse to you know to like you know unnecessarily impact anything but you move a transmission line over here to appease one resource or person and it's that's inevitably you know uh there's very few win win winwin situations so um you know Idaho Power is expanding this site boundary to kind of get ahead of of so all of us aren't sitting in here for Amendment 27 of the B site certificate to move a road um 200 feet right so that's kind of like the generic example we've been talking about you know the intent of expanding the site boundary is that does actually open them up to use I'm going to say ADR the ADR process um because it is possible if a future change if it doesn't impact any resources if it is you know within the site boundary but outside of one of those approved micro sighting areas they can submit an amendment determination request um uh which has its you know requirements um and then in our processing of the ADR we're going to look at the three kods right but this is also something that Idaho Power is going to be looking at in their determination of whether or not they think it's going to be a successful ADR is it's like is there is there a resource out there because also anywhere for that road they're moving 200 ft they're going to have to do their surveys right and provide that so that's going to tell us if there's any impact to any resources um is it going to change any of those conditions um or is it going to require a new condition so that's what we're we're going to look at um now we also heard from lots of folks about their concern that this would give Idaho Power free reign to just move things around which it it doesn't right they're still Bound by process but this does open it up for them particularly in in circumstances where the landowner wants something moved around and they're doing it to work and appease with a a land owner um it's kind of it expedites the process more so we aren't um sitting here talking about something that somebody wants and that doesn't have any impacts so um uh the certificate holder represents in response to people who rais this uh to kind of memorialize its intent to coordinate amicably with land owners in these circumstances for any future ADR they would submit this a landowner kind of consent or affirmation letter so um which I you know this is one of those things we could uh that's fascinating to me to talk about but I know no I know time I know time okay right but like it's interesting what are conditions that come from their origin as a representation rather than uh imposed to meet a standard and there's a big difference because actually I would say for a lot of our facilities the conditions we have are because they said they would do something because it's actually not really necessary to meet a standard here I don't know if we would be able if our if your process if we could ever require something like this so but to me this is responsive and um addresses those concerns of folks associated with this change Kellen could I just step in please we're after after lunch we're all getting tired right but this point that K's making right now is really significant right because one of the concerns that you've heard expressed from the public I think is arises out of a lack of understanding of the FC process and what Kellen is explaining the public has said if you guys do this then idah hope power can go and they can now do whatever they want within the site boundary and they won't be bringing it back in front of you for review or to the public for comment that not the case the important part is the our amendment process as Kellen has pointed out in 34527 350 if something that Idaho Power wants to do within that site boundary if it could result in a significant adverse impact that you have not previously considered hasn't been surveyed you haven't analyzed whether it complies with the standards they have to come back in for an amendment so I just want to make sure that that you're that secretary cornette and thanks for emphasis for the record Todd cornette so we're going to all add on to this um and so my add-on is getting back to the amendment determination request process so we haven't seen one of these in a while but if you recall and and council member I'm and possibly council member Devo and have never seen one so it's a way for somebody to say hey we're going to do this change and we don't believe an amendment is required they have the burden of submitting that and proving that to us we the department have the",

        "text": " due to modeling requirements that is one issue that's been identified in the application that we is something that we're going to have to monitor and consider as we Implement these programs so we will be coming up with a plan for okay um what does implementer mean they going to issue actual funds or program manage and what is their capacity or limits yeah so we're still hammering out all the details for our implementers but the idea is the implementers would broadly be responsible for reviewing and approving projects and issuing actual funds um the extent to which they're managing the programs all of that is going to be ironed out uh as we um as we make those agreements let's see um but I do think the General Vision is like that's who you would go to for the program or what it's worth I think that may be helpful just frame of reference they'd be the ones writing the checks I think is what we imagine right I think we envision a centralized location for people to go but the um yeah but who would be managing your project would be depending on where the project was located okay and then um the next question from ter Teresa in Lane County she's doing tons of great efficiency work I see it in our rental home heat pump results good job down there um is there a maximum amount of rebates and is there or a max amount of funding that needs to be spent by the end of the IRA timeline I think we have to spend all the money by the end of the timeline right that might be a good question foral but is there a maximum amount of rebates is the question I guess I'm not I don't know I'm so each program uh has been for Oregon has been allocated I $56 million so um and then 20% of that is reserved for administrative cost so the balance is what is the max is going to be the maximum amount that's available for these programs as of now and it looks yeah based on our rough timeline for launching it looks like the programs will run for up to eight years um and all the funds will need to be expended during that time I have a comment that says yeah like the EV roll out but I'm not exactly sure what that comment is meant to modify sorry um but if Ben wants to weigh in further he can raise his hand maybe um Tim has a question if a household is at 81% Ami they receive only 50% of here amounts um difficult to retrofit then for those households any thought to step up that percentage such as 81 to 120% Ami to get 75% of a rebate amount 121 to 150 equals 50% of rebate amount for example yeah so unfortunately we don't have the latitude to make that determination for the program usdoe only allowed us to adjust the percentages that they set for the low income less than 80% um category and then then um next up is are you considering policies to avoid displacement especially in terms of upgrades to multif Family Properties yeah so one of the rules of the program is that landlords um I don't remember the specific wording but landlords are going to be required to have a clause in the contract that says that they are uh not able to evict um evict tenants within two years of the program of installing the heat pump uh this is I think a quick one what Ami will you be using City County State I believe it's County okay and how do here income oh let's see question about here income eligibility for rental properties I can take that one so in order for a multi family building to be eligible under the here program um at least or under the programs in general because it works for both um 50% or more of the units need to be occupied by people who are um meet the income requirements um so whether that's the um low or moderate income for or the low income for here and homes program I believe is the focus um sorry I misspoke there um and so then the eligibility if the owner wanted to upgrade for example all of their properties um the the allowable rebates are based on a per unit rebate um so they would be eligible for the rebate based on the percentage of the um units in their property that are meeting the low-income requirements okay hopefully that helps Neil um Robert wants to know what do you mean when you say multif family building will be prioritized in the Portland area I think you mean in Portland or maybe but go ahead on that one what do you mean when you say that will be prioritized multif family build um so the the lowincome multif family um I believe is what we meant by that so um and I think it maybe also alludes to Charity's previous question about the the prioritization in Portland so right now we are at the stage of figuring out how how we are dividing the funding between the two service areas um and the two implementers so one of the factors that we're taking into consideration is that desire to prioritize um the lowincome multif family housing um low income in general and then the the CJ requirements in the Portland area yeah then justice 40 requirements and for anybody who I think we put the map in earlier in the chat um you can also just look up j40 map and I justice 40 map and I think you'll find it but the a lot of the Portland area does not fall into that category so that's what we're talking about there with the need to with the issue of needing to prioritize spending money outside of outside of those non justice 40 areas if that makes sense um we just accidentally answered a question that comes later so that's exciting um we have just a couple minutes left or one minute left so um I'm trying to think how to handle some of the there's a question about adding a smart thermostat element I don't think there's a requirement there um so I don't think we're planning to do anything with that unless um anybody wants to correct me um we already talked about the um breakdown of funding between IOU and um the consumer own utilities um asking about coming up with a way to keep funds regularly flowing given that we just went through a bunch of money for heat pumps with renters really fast definitely something we're working on and trying to figure out how to do that so that um um it's um doesn't just dry up really fast I guess um and then oh gosh there's no way I can get through all these questions I don't know how do we want to handle it I can stay a little bit longer um if other folks can but I don't know if the folks that need to answer the questions can stay a few extra minutes I can stay for a little while don't have anything scheduled after this today same okay cool all right we'll keep going if you have to go you have to go but um we'll try to get through these questions and thanks for we're glad you have a lot of good questions but um sorry we didn't realize we'd have quite this many um so Charity's wondering about cbos directly accessing These funds um again I think this is something we're hoping our implementers can work on but her question is um if these are administered by etto just like any other etto incentive reimbursement These funds will have a lot of trouble reaching households um so it's more of a comment but I think it's something we're really interested in is how we can um kind of change that Dynamic is that a fair answer trying to be quick here and energy trust is is also interested in in that as well which is part of the considerations that went into US deciding to uh include them as a sub recipient uh and then um Doug saying it would require legislation to um clawback the funds which I think is true uh somebody's asking if Washington and California are moving forward in a similar fashion and I think in some ways yes in some ways no we're unique in that we're doing to like a investor eared utilities and a Idaho Power and consumer own utilities type of strategy um given the different desires and interests in those communities so I know that's different but I know they're also planning to work with implementers right anything else you want to add to um we have a very specific question about his own situation from David James um and David we put in the chat the email addresses to reach out to program staff and they can maybe help with your um specific situation I don't know what this is how will Echo Electric funds and gas utility lowincome Energy Efficiency funds be braided does anyone know about Echo no I'm not familiar with that program off the top of my head but um if the funding that you're looking at uh braiding together with these federal funds are rate paay Dollars um then they're definitely allowed to be braided together with these funds to support Energy Efficiency projects and I see you have a question I'm going to get to you in a um let's see David hesam hi David is wondering if we plan to submit a market transformation plan with the implementation plan which I think is our goal or very close together is that right um I don't think we have planed to submit them simultaneously but um the market transformation plan is due within a year of us standing up the program you're right uh funding the balance of funding is going to be dependent on us uh receiving an approved plan um we do hope to submit it as soon after the program starts uh as soon as possible but um but yeah it is Du within one year after yeah I think our overall goal is to get the program started as soon as possible because we've heard that loud and clear that people want to see that happen um and that might mean that and that might also help us with the like spreading out of the funds question that came before um so anyway uh any lessons learned from our friends who have already filled out their they've already filled sent in applications um it says filed their programs I think they've just turned their in their applications so far so they're not those programs are not up and running so we don't have lessons learned yet from them on that um I believe we have been able to sometimes like kind of see some of the things that they did in their application right to help inform the application another thing that I'll just jump in and say is that those states only submitted their applications for here so we may be one of the first states to submit both homes and here yeah because we are planning to submit both at the same time",

        "text": " dealing with you guys and dealing with this is is unbelievably frustrating and we feel like complete underdogs completely outgunned and like the system is truly and i'm not i don't say this lightly but truly corrupt we know a local lawyer that was here who then worked with the state legislature that helped rewrite the laws in oregon that favor the developers as jim just and so and this is of course common across the country across the nation and other that the people with money the corporations they rewrite the laws to favor themselves that's the case i don't think there's no argument about that and the system is not only corrupt in that sense but that we somehow have abdicated our to let corporations that want maximum profit at least cost to themselves they get to make proposals and say oh we're going to put this here where to put that there and then we all have to jump through these endless hoops a decade of hoops because they make a proposal and in in the b2h case i know i'm supposed to talk about it specifically but this is just it shows the the situation is the law which is good i think that says whoever developer must have a elite do a comprehensive study in this case i think it was two years and two million they don't have to follow it in fact in this case they didn't but not to you know be specific but they don't have to follow it so there's this great idea have a have an agency get tons of scientists and look at all the factors should we do you know not should we do it but if we are going to do this where should it go the developers by our laws do not have to follow this multi-year multi-million dollar study so we do the study it's just a waste of time basically and as jim said the only people who are advocating for the people the public and the children and the environment and the future are members of the public that have no expertise and volunteer their most precious resource their time they give up time with their kids their grandkids their pets reading the books they want to read traveling where they want to travel because they they feel obligated to do their best to try to do their duty as a as a as a member of a and so we're we just feel completely out gunned and jim's idea it's well behind the times we should we should have how do we hire lawyers we're fundraising non-stop five bucks here 50 bucks there 100 bucks there to try to go up against legions of lawyers and pr people and experts and again the system i would say is corrupt because as jim said it's true the developers the for-profit corporations work with odo who should be serving the public we pay we pay for the agencies and the government and willingly do that because we need it but the developers have this cozy relationship with odo we don't how can we how can we possibly be close to all of these lawyers and experts that have these tens of thousands of pages and are just checking off the boxes and i guess my my main point to you is you have absolutely no to these for-profit corporations who just want to make a buck i used to think as i grew up the utilities are great we all love electricity i love electricity but these utilities that provide us water electricity wherever they're public service organizations right well turns out they're not they're not they're largely for-profit corporations and one proposal since you guys are the experts in the state i would really urge you since you know how this system works better than i do that we change the system so there's a state map that has a bunch of red areas where we're not going to do anything no wind farms no pipelines no electrical transmission lines or anything like that because there are precious resources we're not going to do any of that next to crater lake i hope or other places like that right and we should have energy quarters stipulated energy corridors where things can go like this is probably a good place for solar farms no one wants one in their backyard but they're a great and i i think probably some other people testified this is 2022 not in real land anymore in 1920 which was such a great idea then we're in microgrid resiliency and besides new technology and new ideas we shouldn't be thinking of old tech you know just stringing up more lines that are actually unbelievably in terms of waste of electricity going through the lines but we also live in a high risk environment where various types of wars are are sadly likely and earthquakes and so on and big grid is not the way to go energy productions like um i have a place up in malawa county and now they're taking the the canals for the water distribution and they're putting turbines in there and they're making enough electricity to run all the pivots great idea local solutions and we have all this technology now and we're talking about you guys didn't invent it i didn't invent it someone said i know let's build a pipeline across oregon let's build a transmission line across oregon because we can make money not to serve the people not because it's the best so my point is that mostly that you have no obligation to check off these boxes and rubber stamp these proposals and i know bureaucratically that that's how it goes it's like we got to do this we gotta do this jump through the hoops sign it off next project can you guys right now wrap your eyeballs in that i've never seen a binder that thick in my life oh my um i'll try to wrap up here one one very specific thing too is i think it's important that the um administrative law judge the hearings there be another one so the same hearings officer isn't hearing appeals to their own rulings that just seems inappropriate in a democracy and i wouldn't want to go to a court case if that was that's how it was um again i'd just like to reiterate we feel like as the public they're representing ourselves and our own personal interests and those of our communities and those of our state and of the future for an future for everybody that comes after us we feel at the mercy of for-profit corporations like pacific power it's owned by one of the richest men in the world warren buffett he's telling us what our future is going to be is that how this system should work so we're at their mercy or i would say their lack of mercy because all they care about is the bottom line their accountants invent this stuff and so it's not mercy it's it's mercenary and it's not fair to oregon it's not fair to the public it's not fair to our great and i think we can do a much better job so i would just urge you feel no obligation in fact hold corporations to the very very very highest standards because that's what we expect of you and hope from you so thank you very much for for listening thank you mr berry anyone else that wants to comment hi my name is annie ray and i live in portland now but for 30 years i did live out here my children played basketball in this gym and i went to college when mr gilbert was the president of eastern oregon state college and there were public hearings held here addressing concerns with idaho power so idaho power has a long long history here and they wanted to build a dam to block the snake river there would be no hells canyon there would be no river at all if the people in this community hadn't stood up to idaho power and mark capfield and bob packwood presided and it was right here on this and um the rules were made that you couldn't wear a logo or even a baseball cap that said sos save our snake people were arrested for wearing a baseball cap to you know a basic first amendment right so in some ways we have come a long way we can have our signs and say our peace however our speech is still restricted obfuscated processes and procedures that say no you cannot speak you we won't hear that that's not allowed here that is against the rules and don't you dare wear a baseball cap that says sos or we'll throw you in the back of a police car and rough yeah so we have seen it all and idaho power did not keep their word about building fish ladders i don't need to go into all of that history a lot of people have very hard feelings about um the history of idaho power on this and if we didn't stand up and if we did not have the visionary leadership of packwood and hatfield and the others you know over time and i'm old enough i saw it with my own eyes there's been such a turnover i mean there always is um the nature of history marches on and people weren't here all the staff was different all the you know community comes and goes but those of us who are old enough and we're there recognize what would have been lost had the people not been courageous and willing to put themselves a great discomfort um to try to do the right thing and so i feel like history of this place in this room on this campus in this town within these rivers within these mountains continue to be the foundation of what we're all about here and that we need to continue you know do not give up um because i know power has different staff they have different money they they keep on doing their thing however the land is still here and that's what i wanted to bear witness to today thanks for having this public hearing thank you ms ray anyone else to comment hi thanks for having us this is fuji kreider living in the grand i wasn't sure i was going to speak but after all the conversation i think i had and uh i just want to um say that from all these meetings with you guys and even other meetings a little closer thanks stanley um for various rule makings and other meetings we've been out and all i often feel like you're basically um and i'm sitting in like it's democracy by checklist so we had a public hearing check we have a public comment period check we have this check check check i just encourage you to not um maybe you don't feel this way but it feels this way to the public now you're hiding behind these rules and these and again it's just check check limited limit like you just with blinders on it's very very frustrating state agencies are underfunded there's rules that are very outdated there's lists that don't get kept up to date it's um you know it's really unfortunate",

screening judge webster aired in citing the supplementary analysis and proposed mitigation as convincing evidence of no significant impact on park visitors the applicant is careful to mention lower towers but not that they have tripled the number of towers impacting the park's remote southwestern view shed this is not appropriate mitigation these remote areas with natural scenery are highly prized and to have such fantastic open views of distant miles of rolling hills available within a five-minute drive from town and a 15-minute hike in the park is a priceless opportunity the remote areas of the park will not benefit from the proposed mitigation they will be destroyed by it if the line were needed the only reasonable mitigation is to bury the portions of the line visible from the remote areas of the park the new analysis concluded that even though views from morgan lake park would be highly compromised there still would be less than significant impact on human perception

impact must be replaced by a carefully analyzed established professional methodology fooled you once don't let them do it again you miss barry any questions from thank you thank you good afternoon council members again for the record this is jocelyn pease for idaho power company um i wanted to start out with the issue statement which relates to the mitigation proposed for the visual impacts to morgan lake park and specifically references a hundred thousand dollars for recreational facility improvements and as mr ratcliffe indicated that was part of a memorandum of agreement idaho power and the city of legrand which would be implemented if the morgan lake route is developed that gives this the city of the grand the discretion to determine how it might use that money to improve the park and so if if they want to use that for improvements to the undeveloped areas they can do that now as it would relate to the additional mitigation that idaho power had proposed in terms of the use of h-frames idaho power proposed that analysis or provided analysis regarding the use of age frames and its rebuttal testimony which was offered in november in accordance with the schedule set forth in the contested case ms barry had claimed that that was offered late in the game in january and that was just an incorrect statement that was offered consistent with the schedule that was defined in our case miss berry had also made an allegation that idaho power has tripled the number of towers that would be used and that statement is also incorrect um she claims that instead of four towers there would be 13 in fact idaho power is replacing 12 lattice towers with 19 h frames so there is an increase um but it's not quite as dramatic as miss berry contends on lucy there's anything finally regarding ms barry's assertion that the alj airs and relying on the rebuttal analysis that was offered in this case and airs in relying on idaho power's commitment to provide mitigation in the form of h-frames in the vicinity of morgan lake park that statement is it can't be supported the judge properly relied on the rebuttal analysis that was offered in a okay thank you oh this is the court reporter um she cut off at about did she the judge properly relied on the rebuttal analysis that was offered in a um i i think that was close to the close of my remarks um it's up to you that's all i got yeah timely fashion yeah the the that the um the judge didn't did not air in relying on the rebuttal testimony that was offered in accordance with the schedule outlined in this case thank you all yeah yes councillor buyer but i just wanted to thank you for clarifying that the agreement with the city of le grand allows the city to make a decision on how those funds would be used in the event that this route is chosen there's nothing that says it has to be used to improve the campground or the parking area it's left to the city to decide as and the intent is that the mitigation for the visual impacts is the h-frame polls and how those are cited that that's right the mitigation that idaho power offered in the form of age frames is additional to the hundred thousand dollars that's that's agreed to in the moa with the city of la grande okay thank you miss peace um any changes the council needs to make on the proposed contested case order for recreation standard three i guess we're then ready for a straw for the record todd cornett um so no to r3 and no changes to the standard that's correct then agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of in the proposed order pertaining to the recreation standard that are not related to the issues in the contested case and in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue r3 sounds right okay perry chalk toot and buyer cindy condon hanley jenkins jordan truitt ken howe thank you council members we will take a break here and return at four o'clock weather hello hello uh for the record calendar weather oregon department of let me get my screen here um i wanted to uh take just a quick moment let me breeze through here and figure out where i'm at we got two messengers um we're also waiting for a few more for the folks on the line we're waiting for a few other people council members to join our group i just wanted to take a moment to say that i have been corrected in my um description of the morgan lake alternative and pro proposed route i think i was talking about under the scenic resource standard i kind of wrote wove in a reference from one of the public comments um about the mill creek route um and so and i said that it was the proposed route and that's not accurate the mill creek route was a route that came out of the nepa review but is not reflected in the application for site certificate so this is just just to make sure that accurate okay okay all right okay just making sure i'm getting it right however what is in front of council right now proposed route and the morgan lake alternative in union county but i just wanted to make sure that we got got that got that clarified how is that not okay okay well and i am talking about union okay we have a quorum of the council we are ready to move forward all right we're going to proceed with the council's fishing habitat uh fish and wildlife habitat standard um the um so to the the fish wildlife habitat center which i'm sitting here staring at it and it does actually have habitat in it this is not named correctly correct okay so one of the things i was going to emphasize and i'm looking at the name of how we have it labeled here and it's missing the word habitat is the important aspect about this standard is that it really is oriented towards habitat um and so sub one directs council and the department to work and coordinate with and be consistent with the oregon department of fish and wildlife habitat uh mitigation policy which also includes their habitat um so the habitat categorization from odf and w goes from a categorization of category one to category six where one being the um most uh exclusive and i'm not using i don't have the their language right in front of me and sarah probably has it memorized but kind of i'm just gonna air quote best habitat or habitat that should be most protected and then six being a the poorer quality habitat and then it continues on that spectrum and where uh habitat category has a separate goals and mitigation goals for habitat well quantity and quality so let me go here okay i have some maps here this is another one of those issues where i had to pdf my powerpoint so you're missing a table in there and it but it's a table that it summarizes which actually is that just more valuable than this this figure here um but it summarizes uh the habitat uh categorization um just along for the proposed route and the alternative routes an example and so we had talked under um threatened endangered species we talked about category one habitat for the washington ground squirrel um other examples of category one habitat are um the occupied uh wags colonies um trees are structures with special status raptor nests and then um caves with that are hibernacular for bats mostly i'm just working in the my favorite word that i've learned here in this job so okay that's and that's all avoidance and so but uh there is a lot of the transmission lines that crosses through and council is pretty familiar with category two habitat category two habitat is um ale elk and mule winter range there's also uh pygmy rabbits is considered category 2 um all in all there is approximately 4 403 acres of category 2 3 4 and 5 habitat that would be um that would be temporarily and permanently impacted by the proposed facility um and also incorporated into and would be mitigated and also restored particularly with those the temporary impacts this slide i'm just going to touch on some of the fish and wildlife habitat conditions we've talked about some of them before i'm going to start with the bottom here on my screen in conditions 15 and 16 there are a lot of fish and wildlife conditions a lot of have timing restrictions seasonal but 15 and 16 are the conditions that specify that certain surveys must be conducted according to the this final biological biological survey work plan and it's attachment p1 um that is attached to the um uh final order or proposed order correct right and so that has and the reason why that's important is that the survey protocols are agreed to and worked with odf and w where odf and w says this is an appropriate methodology to go out in the field and conduct this survey all of those protocols for all of the the habitats and species that we've looked at and that we've kind of talked about under threatened endangered species and for other in other habitats are kind of absolutely set out in that plan and so these are the conditions that say do those surveys according to these protocols you",

        "text": " our our cleanup section uh next slide so some public involvement opportunities um the newon research development de demonstration permit is going to come out in early 2024 so there'll be a public comment period announcement um for that and that has to do with um technology associated with vapors and air quality U the long awaited 200000 gallon testbed initiative um research development demonstration permit is estimated to be out in March to April 2024 we're aiming for early March um we're really down to a final document for um um engineer review associated with the one of the facilities so some drawings and then um tribe party agreement public involvement survey please uh it's open now uh it's on our ecology blog um and if you have any questions Ryan can forward you a link if if this one doesn't happen to work for you uh but it's open now January 3rd to February 16 next slide and more um a operating permit compliance activities this is the waste management section that does most of um so uh July and August we're very busy trying to get out on sight and do do all that work um while the weather is right and um you know I saw a different report earlier today that I was reading on a a monthly report I get from my sections and um we have a performance partnership agreement with EPA and our um compliance activities our inspections and our report writing are on track to meet that obligation to the EPA so excited to see that our team continues to diligently work on these things and go back for just a second Ry I'm trying to remember there's anything on here specific that doesn't look like it okay slide all right so now the Hanford swide status um I'm going to cover kind of the the process piece and then I'm going to turn it over to Ryan to talk about Public public Outreach here in a second so we're we're planning on 120-day public comment period and the minimum is 45 so we're trying we know it's a huge permit um so we wanted to at least acknowledge up front there's going to be some extra work with this um we will definitely provide early notification of the public comment period And I believe that's a 30-day if I remember correctly um that we we give on that before we even open the public comment period so people arew it's coming um it'll include 48 unit groups and two corrective Action Unit groups so 50 unit groups total in within each unit group there can be anywhere from five to 12 sections within it so it's a huge permit ends up being approximately 20,000 pages I think the previous one was 16,000 and we're adding some facilities that were never in the permit um before like this the the single shell tanks Believe It or Not were never in the permit um because we were under interim status so we're trying to get this fully up to date it's been a long process to get there and um I guess if there's specific questions I can try and answer those as to what's going on with that process uh so staff from mology and the permites we're working really hard to get everything together um and basically it's corre collecting the information and the data required order to actually draft the renewal of the permit and then in 2012 2013 there was an initial initiative to get this started and um once it got going there was a lot of public comment from the public tribal Nations and permites and so um we're trying to incorporate the comments from that period of time and answer those as we go forward in this permit and Ryan I'm going to go ahead and let you do the public Outreach piece and then we'll pause for a moment well actually that's the last slide we can do questions perfect um so as you can imagine the big permit we were planning a lot of public involvement for in Outreach uh this is part of what I've I've shared before with others so I just carried over to here because I wanted to share with this board specifically but we're developing quite a bit of materials for this Comet period to try and help the public easier digest it and one of those methods we have is what we call uh baseball cards they're not actual baseball cards they're actually like a PowerPoint slide that that actually will outline like a unit group and provide some high level information about it some permitting information about it um and I have a sample of one of those at the very end of the slideshow just to pop up if anybody's interested uh you can you can I know the um presentation was attached to the agenda so you could look at one of the sample baseball cards will working on if you're interested but um so there's going to be about a total of 49 of those and in addition to having those at the public meetings we're going to uh put those up on our website and they'll be like an interactive kind of like Adobe like flip through kind of a book where you could um intera act and and scroll through them so we're trying to get that digital version in addition to the other version that prepared of course with any comment period we're going to have a variety of fact sheets and focus sheets and stuff but we're trying to uh build upon those a little bit we actually have a couple like one Pages we're developing like two of them are already live on our public comment periods website web page one of them is is just one page where we developed called what is a comment period and it just talks about Hanford comment periods and what the process looks like um you know kind of the steps and timeline for a comment period and then we've got another one pager that talks and I think it's called like how to tips for writing a public comment and it just offers some some tips and suggestions and explainers on you know how you can write an effective public comment that that um you know like a meaningful public comment for for a comment period obviously we try our best to respond to every comment but um if you're trying to write a comment that that you has the potential to have an impact versus uh just an example if you write your public comment saying clean up Hanford uh I mean we'll respond to it there's just not a lot we can do with a comment like that so the the the goal of our one pager was to kind of walk through some tips and ideas on on you know how you can write a comment that that um can you know get a better response from us and possibly you know be incorporated um Ander the permit uh so in addition to all that we've got we're going to have a dedicated website page we're going to be sending out a variety of Public Notices uh news release and we'll be working in getting some earned media uh planning on some social media posts and paid advertising um and this is the component I think that we wanted to hear from the this board on some more was we're planning a host of uh informational meetings in public hearings there's a bit of a difference there in that public hearings we actually take formal like oral comment during the meeting so the informational meetings are meant to be provided before the comment period and kind of uh at the start of the comment period to provide like general information about the permit try and help folks understand it and then we're going to plan public hearings in the back half of the comment period to actually uh you know take formal comment on the permit um and so so we're planning a variety of in-person and online public meetings and public hearings um we're planning them uh in a couple different spots in Washington as well as down in Oregon and so uh what I'm interested in it doesn't have to be immediate but I'm interested to hear from any board members if you guys have any feedback or suggestions on uh possible you know ideal locations for meetings and and uh Oregon you know where Portland Hood River if you've got um any suggestions for me on like venues that kind of thing I'm really just looking for some feedback because we're we're going to be starting to plan and and book meetings once we get closer to you know all the permit files being finalized and all that stuff so I'm I would really be open to any feedback that you guys have and can send to me on uh on just Oregan um public Outreach and involvement um and then addition to all that we're going to be taking comments on we have an ecomment system website where you can submit comments virtually and and you can also send them to us mail um uh or over email so a couple different avenues for actually submitting your public comment um I'll pause there uh and Laura I see you had your hand raised do you have a question yes I I wonder who um this is a bigger picture in for my head um who is the permit being submitted to doe I'm a little confused about you're applying for a permit for Hanford a what is is that to doe now there's a there's an existing sitewide permit and then typically every five to seven years you would renew a permit this just hasn't happened for a really long time here at Hanford and what happens is Department of energy is applying for renewal of their permit with the upgrades the ecology and what you do is lessons learned from the previous permit you try and incorporate that in the new one and so um in this case it's energy permit they're requesting the renewal and we're working through getting making sure we have all the information we need in order to um clear to declare that the renewal is um complete so doe is requesting from state of Washington a renewal technically yes um I just didn't quite I was just confused on that I I fully get it yeah it's uh and and EPA is very uh concerned about us getting this done as well so we've got a little pressure from PA to get it done uh with our um delegated authority and there's just it's been so long just it's time to update the permit okay thank you sure Ryan uh Jeff White here we we will uh talk about what uh venues might be appropriate and and uh with Odo about whether Portland Hood River maybe you matilla as well but we we'll get back to you in the coming months on that cool yeah thank you I really appreciate it yeah so any feedback is welcome so thank you so much we have the acronyms in case we missed something in our presentation so that's there and then um next slide is any other questions anybody might have okay thanks guys as usual great uh great presentation appreciate your taking the",

        "text": " were looking for what the program is looking for based on responses and then also just our experience of applications where we've seen uh you know very specific and On Target responses as well as responses that are uh you know that are trying to answer that particular question but it's not really related to answering that question and we just try to guide them in awareness of that and then apply their scoring appropriately as they see uh as they say fit and um so I think with that that we have uh any other public questions in there I know that we're a couple minutes over right now there is one from Toby he says there has been a historic unwillingness to develop green hydrogen projects in Oregon if a solar green hydrogen Storage Fuel Cell system which provides both electricity and clean fuel were proposed would it be uh Clayton you want to go on that one on yeah I'd have to we'd have to look at the specifics of what was being proposed um energy storage is one of our eligible um the fuel would not be because our Technologies are for energy that is thermal or electric and I you know combustible fuels even in clean fuels I don't think qualify but we'd have to look at the specifics on the energy storage part and providing the electricity as long as that energy storage is paired with a renewable energy generation system um that is that is right out of the the statute so please take a look at the at the opportunity announcements and at the program rule the Oregon administrative rule for our program all the links on our website and you can match up the rule for authorized Technologies and their deployment with your project thank you for the question tell me it's definitely something we'd love to take a look at with a little bit more detail um in an offline capacity and be able to answer uh be able to answer your question a little more specifically and Sarah I know we're uh we're uh we're coming here towards the end I apologize to our public I hope we were able to address the public questions coming in um without the segue between our discussion and uh public commentary time uh but we are coming up on our one hour time frame and just wanted to uh quickly touch on from Members still here with us our next steps are going to be continuing these round three adjustments and getting the opportunity announcements uh through our system and approved ready for a round three launch as I said later in the summer or early fall as well as we mentioned before in the presentation we're gonna we'll be continued tracking our round one and round two uh grantee and projects as well as doing report verifications and any follow-up and updates that come with those reporting uh requirements for our grantees and then obviously uh in full mode to do preparation and get ready for our round three launch and just for everybody's tentative schedule we will be looking at in our next advisory committee meeting to rep to cover third quarter of this year in September that would probably be looking more towards the mid to late end of September and we'll make sure we get uh updates out ahead of that based on our discussion today uh clay and I will move forward with putting a little more information together on these scoring criteria changes and get that information out to you with a little bit more detail for some continued discussion in the offline space and with that clay if you could go to the next slide please next slide please we we kind of combined it all today for anyone else here if you're not familiar with the uh odo's website and the and how to find the secret program just go to oregon.gov backslash energy and in the left column under the incentives you'll see the community renewable energy grant program uh click on that and that will take us to take you directly to our incentive programs webpage where you can find some of those the guidance and information a lot of applicant details if you're looking at doing around three application and even for our grantees or Partners working with grantees please review that information on there and play if we could go one more slot uh and then if any questions do come up I know we had a little short in time with our public comment uh on our crap page uh we do have a q a portal that's open to anyone so if we uh somehow missed you or ran out of time for a um please feel free to go to the crap our the crap webpage and you'll see that questions Tab and to submit a question through that q a portal and we will definitely get back in touch with you and make sure that

        "text": " pretty steep in my opinion just for 2023 I think it's it's a good goal but to require 40 for 2023 as of April just surprises me a little bit it doesn't include the actual charging system it just includes the electrical service capacity that's my understanding so we've been coordinating with uh other jurisdictions uh Corvallis in the city of tiger to partially removed their uh minimum parking requirements and are seeing the process of updating their development codes the other departments that I've coordinated with are all pursuing uh pathway one is simply a very challenging to to go after the other Pathways a number of jurisdictions in the metro area have also requested uh alternative implementation timelines and that's the one that you were recommending at least for parking B right yeah pathway one remove all minimum parking requirements um it seems like the other pathways are very challenging I think they would be for Washington County as well um but we could explore them further if we had more time so here we are um and then this is part the first part of the regulatory changes again these are 11 of the 64 new sections of code so there are several other things forthcoming next is in the metro area Metro is required to amend their Urban growth management functional plan and their amendments are scheduled for 2024 in the ordinance and our responses to that are scheduled for 2025 in their their rules um the the changes to the urban growth management functional plan are likely at least the way they're worded now to result in US needing to do additional planning around the Raleigh Hills Town Center and again this this could change but um that's what we envision may come out of the the next part of the process and there are additional requirements for land use and transportation in all of the regional and town centers um furthermore when we go about updating our transportation system plan uh as a major update there are a number of changes we will need to make as part of a parallel track to our community development code um related to uh land use types of of actions and we're still exploring those and we think that'll end up being a separate part of our next transportation system Plan update speaking to transportation system plan updates there's not a timeline for completing one however there is a variety of things that are we can do as far as modifying or amending our plan that are called a minor update and we could go ahead and process minor updates uh before doing an update a major update but we will be required to do a major transportation system Plan update um just to sort of Resort uh the the plan uh based on the language and requirements of of these rules in general the plan is is very much in track in line with a lot of these requirements maybe some of the other aacs and cities were not however we think ours is is um fairly close there of course are some things that we will have to take a hard look at as we do go through the update of the transportation uh plan uh particularly any um any project that does not demonstrate a reduction in vehicle miles traveled may have additional uh thought need to be put into it and yep checking my notes I I think that's it except for questions so I'll turn it back over to uh Aaron to uh talk about the next steps yeah just to wrap this up we wanted to revisit our staff recommendation and so our staff recommendation is to request an alternative implementation timeline for the elements of parking reform B this is particularly because we expect dlcd and lcdc to make changes to these rules throughout this year and so it doesn't really make sense for us to quickly file an ordinance when the rules may change underneath us so at the time we prepared this PowerPoint we had been told by dlcd staff that requesting a one-year extension is very reasonable so that's what we put on the slide we then learned that many other jurisdictions including Clackamas County received an 18-month timeline and so we think it may make more sense to ask for 18 months and if they walk us back to 12 that's okay but I think it might make sense to be in line with Clackamas County's requirement and then we're also looking for the board's guidance on receiving a recommendation or preparing a recommendation for the future ordinances as a part of the long-range planning work program which you'll receive a work session on next month chair Harrington let's go to Jerry first no that's okay go ahead and chair and while she's up there go ahead I I I don't mean to step on the vice chairs roll because he's doing a great job thank you well I'm on Zoom uh for you have his staff recommendation from slide 11 to proceed with parking B pathway one and I just want to make sure that we as the board take the opportunity to give you Direction on that that's all what slide number was that chair that you were referring to 11. slide 11. and actually I think we have that here as well in our policy um actually my wish go back to 11. so pursuing pathway one I can go back to 11 so we can look at that one um that is the table slide yes so receiving your guidance on this will guide how staff prepare our future ordinance so we have some time on this we'll bring it back as a part of the work program next month and then we'll have the opportunity hopefully over the next 18 months to bring in ordinance forward to your maybe multiple ordinances in order to address these requirements but generally we would appreciate getting at least a head nod that we're on the right track with pathway one we think that Pathways two and three are probably just too onerous for Washington County to take on so I've been using all my zoom body language too to vote for one teleport what my uh preference is I hope commissioner Willie and commissioner Rogers are getting a a kick out of me as I'm sure I'm bigger on the big screen than I am on my little teeny so should we pause here and see are there is there any guidance to pursue the other Pathways or should we focus on pathway one I just want to know Catherine is this is this a one to you or something what's wrong with it yeah there we go yeah I think we're in agreement with pathway one yeah let's do that I need one of those big foam hands yeah my only two comments would be one I'd ask for 24 months instead of 18 because I know back you down to 18 never started 18 and get back down as well I like that and then I would uh consult just as me and I would probably consult with County Council and see if we can't file an amicus brief to be heard um I think he's done a good job in tutoring me and others about you know you're either on the plate or you're uh yeah it was part of the process at the table or on the menu there you go that's even better yeah I said and so I'd like to have it placed at the table I that's just my personal belief that we ought to be able to talk about these things they're for good purpose but they they're not practical yeah yeah so that's my thought hammer and if you said did you guys have comments do you want to make didn't want to I I think that uh please minor question but then do you know what path most cities in Washington County are thinking of are you in conversation with the cities to try to figure out because it'll be really weird if we had one requirement and then the upas have another one my understanding is that every jurisdiction is pursuing pathway one at this time I think the City of Medford was maybe entertaining pathway three but we didn't hear that they had decided on that for sure and the default would be pathway one so it seems like pathway one is the consensus choice and then you can direct me this one is just my own curiosity and knowledge and you can directly work which document I need to dig deep into but I was wondering is there any projections of the significant reduction of carbon Footprints with this uh heated Pathways one two or we can certainly look into that and see if that's something that dlcd staff prepared as a part of the rules I'm not sure that I've seen that though so I don't know if it's out there I haven't seen that we can look into that though thank you well I guess I think uh commissioner five touched on something that I was thinking of too that would keep referring to BMT a reduction of VMT because we're basically taking away the ability to have a car or incentivize not having a car um this this doesn't seem to really make a heck of a lot of sense so what is the what what are the lawsuits directing at what are they asking for there's a couple of different factors um in the legal action that was filed um one of those was based on the fact that it's an unfunded mandate for jurisdictions to comply with this I think there was also a case made for overreach of dlcd's authority and then I believe there was a challenge to the way that the rules were created and whether or not it followed the correct rulemaking procedures and so I think those were the main three points and we would have to check in with the other jurisdictions and find out the status of that legal action at this time to see where it is would anybody be opposed to having you bring back some more information maybe Tom giving this a little dissertation just seems like we'd understand okay I'm saying don't here yeah yeah we'd know what's going on you can do that yeah we'll prepare that I would agree Pam did you have anything more I didn't want to cut you off I I was thinking more on on a big picture thing as we get a semiconductor Factory that comes in and builds a d1z and what's attached housing and Intel's great at building their parking structures out there with those I mean would that even be allowed how do they facilitate another thousand employees into one facility or how many of it is I mean this sounds to me like it's very anti-economic development period it doesn't it doesn't prohibit the developer from doing it it just means that we can't require the developer isn't that's the way I read it am I right correct correct what's the exception of going back to what they require you uh require of you to do in a parking lot and that's what I was going to add is that that is correct",

the august 29th and 30th and 31st 2022 meeting of the energy facility citing council to order i want to thank all of you for your attendance tonight we appreciate you taking the time and we're interested in your comments mr secretary are there any agenda modifications uh mr chair i'm this mike test test can anybody hear me yep okay maybe maybe it's the mask okay um so roll call ken howe hanley jenkins jordan truett here cindy condon perry choctoot uh mr chair uh mr vice chair you have a okay thank you and i jumped the gun there and so are there agenda modifications mr chair i did hear from council members earlier before the meeting um that you would like to defer voting on the draft meeting minutes uh until tomorrow or wednesday depending upon so i guess we will defer that okay thank you i have the following announcements please silence your cell phones those participating via phone or webinar please mute your phone and if you receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back after finishing your other call for those signed into the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam reminder to counsel and to anyone addressing the council to please

meeting are not acceptable pursuant to oregon administrative rule three four five zero one one zero zero eight zero any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled so we're going to move discussion over the meeting minutes to tomorrow or wednesday and we're ready for the council secretary report thank you mr vice chair uh first i have a staffing update uh the last council meeting i had let council members know that we had somebody who had accepted the rulemaking coordinator position the operations of poly policy analyst 3 position who was intending to start on august 22nd so unfortunately that person has elected not to accept the position and has chosen to pursue something else and therefore we have reinitiated the recruitment process for that position in the meantime christopher clark will continue to serve as the rulemaking coordinator as he has in the last several months so he'll pull double duty being a sighting analyst as well as rulemaking coordinator so he'll continue to move forward on the rule making projects as well as the assigned projects that he's working on so and we thank chris for his efforts on next on my list are project updates so on august 7th the notice of intent for the bonanza energy facility expired so once a notice of intent is filed by an applicant they have two years within which to submit a preliminary application prior to the conclusion of that two year time frame they can also submit a request for an extension for one year to extend the notice of intent by one year which means extending the ability to submit the preliminary application for site certificate for one year uh bonanza facility uh failed to either submit a preliminary application or a request for an extension so that facility has expired or at least that notice of intent has expired and the facility was proposed at 150 to 300 megawatts it's was a solar energy project with up to 1100 megawatts of battery storage related relating and supporting facilities the project was proposed to be on 2700 acres so 4.2 square miles it was to be located in klamath county near the town of bonanza and the applicant was hecate energy bonanza llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of hecate energy naf llc they have indicated their intention to resubmit a notice of intent in 2023 so we'll wait to see if they do second on my list is the oregon trail on august 19 2022 we received a request for amendment number one for that amendment request includes two individual requests the first is to expand extend the beginning construction date from august 30th 2022 to august 30th 2025. so to they did not construct the facility within the time frames originally approved and they're requesting a time frame extension for that and the second request is to revise condition 50 sub b to eliminate the requirement of a cultural resources monitor being present when ground disturbance occurs at depths of 12 inches or greater to requiring cultural resource monitor being present when there is the initial open ground disturbance below 12 inches associated with collection line trenching in the solar array so that's a little bit nuanced and so i just wanted to throw that out there so you're kind of aware of it but really it's about sort of the presence of on-site cultural resource monitors during construction they're requesting a change to that they've also requested a type b review the facility is approved to include any combination of wind and solar components not to exceed 41 megawatts including up to 14 excuse me 16 wind turbines or up to 1 228 acres of solar pv generation and the entire site boundary is approved at 13 800 acres the facility was originally part of the montag wind power facility but was split off from that facility through amendment number five in september of 2020 that's why it when i described it it's a rather small facility it's because originally it was part of a a much bigger facility and then they split the site certificate into three the applicant excuse me the certificate is oregon trail solar llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of oven grid renewables llc which is the us division of the parent company ibradrola and i have one enlisted council has any questions on either of my project updates i have one more update there is a group uh called verde which is currently working with renewable northwest and thousand friends of oregon and they just begin pulling together a comprehensive stakeholder uh they've called it a table but essentially you know a a group of diverse uh individuals and and representatives from different areas to discuss the sighting process in oregon and and i'm quoting from their information how to address some of the frictions that are coming up between communities and developers and whether there are any changes that may need be needed in the system to help new policy goals such as those established in house bill 2021 but also to protect community so it's a pretty diverse group the public interest groups state agencies other natural resource groups so it's a fairly large group so just so i you have some understanding verde the entity uh their website states that its purpose is is to serve communities by building environmental wealth through social enterprise outreach and advocacy so that's the really the head of this the group met on august 19th it will again meet on september 2nd with additional meetings planned through the fall the idea of the work group as we understand it is to seek input from a broad group of stakeholders in order to identify potential legislation for the 2023 session the near-term goal is to have a placeholder holder study lc legislative concept submitted on september 23rd and spend time throughout the fall working to identify uh what should be included there are legislators who are part of who have been engaged including mayfield representative marsh representative brock smith representative owens representative helm representative pham representative levy senator lieber senator findley and senator dembro if any council members would like to be um included invited it's not our group we're not the lead but if anybody's interested in tracking or being invited to that we can reach out to the group leaders and see if we can get an invitation extended to any council members who are interested todd just a question about verde or do they have experience uh pulling diverse groups together do you know i mean is this a common practice for them i i think so um i don't i don't personally have much experience for them but that's my understanding is that's kind of their what they do um they're kind of more of a grassroots organization seeking kind of broad you know broad input um so that's my understanding okay i may um is there anybody from the department yes involved the department has been participating so far thank you okay mr vice chair with that i will conclude my secretary report thank you secretary cornett um the next is the boardman to hemingway transmission line at the last meeting in july the council reviewed the standards from the proposed order that did not result in any contested case issues this august meeting the council reviewed the standards from the proposed order that did result in contested case issues we have kellen tardy weather oregon department of energy senior siting analyst and jesse ratcliffe senior assistant attorney general natural resources section of the oregon department of justice presenting and walking us through those standards this evening so with that i'll turn it over to mrs tardy thank you vice chair hal for the record my name is party weather oregon department of energy i am trying to share my screen so um and normally through all of those introductions we would have had um a a powerpoint and a screen corresponding with all of those but i'm having issues sharing my screen right now one minute if we may while i would just try to troubleshoot this and i may have somebody else just share until i can figure this out um to cover so i just announcements i have the i have the powerpoint on my screen and we're going to work on getting it up on the screen here so thank you for being this is the introduction and here um we are so i'm going to do and i know it's easier to have the visual representation but i'll just do it orally just to kind of get us get us going here um i",

        "text": " research subcommittees uh what your kind of specific scope and charges are and what it is that we are hoping for um to have for deliverables on that um uh were you going to bring that you planning to do that yeah so um I hope that uh it wasn't um that my memo uh you weren't overwhelmed by it and I hope what it does is it provides some uh Clarity and sense of direction to you and so during this particular uh uh discussion time um we're here to help provide even further Clarity so in kind of your review of that memo what questions did you have about your committee's charge or the particular deliverables or the scope um that that you have uh going forward here um I know it sounds like a lot if you think you know I think the first presentations we looked at are coming out later this year in October right so my hope is that maybe each committee uh will kind of give their recommendation at a meeting and we'll do that over the course course of three different meetings one for each committee and so the first one of those in October so that's a little over seven month or about seven months away um and so uh hopefully that's enough time for you to uh spend an hour or two a week here and there uh in kind of this work um but uh and coming to a conclusion where we can provide a good robust and well supported recommendations right I in that memo we've outlined a number of uh questions and and data points I recognize not all those data points will necessarily apply to your specific scope or that we will be able to find out that information but I hope what it does is is it kind of send you down some Pathways of seeking that data uh get you to dive a little bit deeper um than we might otherwise and and regardless of kind of what data you can you can find and locate um that you'll be able to produce some uh some well supported recommendations that we can then consider taking to City counil uh and helping them achieve helping the city achieve the greenhouse gas redu mission reduction efforts um so with that any questions any issues you're foreseeing any further guidance you'd like to have Debbie I would like to know where the city is because um reading reading some of the stuff that was handed out in the last packet it sounds like they've been transitioning to Electric uh equipment for a while here and there I just want to know like what's the status on that now um what's is it 25% now that we've transitioned or 5% sure and yes good question and Dylan's going to piggyback because I had a similar question is I guess to that point because I think it applies to all of them I wonder if there's any way that Juliana could kind of like give each group a memo so to speak of like kind of just compiling what exists already because I imagine she has done a lot of that work and I know that when I was on the climate action plan there was a lot of things that were given in terms of some of the reports and like with some of the strategies listed of and I think some of this is in the final version of you know a likely amount of greenhouse gas reductions this is high low Etc similar to what the revenue task force came so it seems like there might be some starting information that already exists that I wonder if it could be sent out I don't know what truly on this capacity is like but given this is hopefully mutually beneficial if she could send some of that out that might have what you're saying you know here's like the here's where we are and then here's what the goal says could give each group a little bit something to work so I don't know staff if that's feasible but just wanted to I had a similar question on some of my uh on some of the charges in my section of you know trying to get a better sense of status quo we can certainly think about that and I had similar questions GW and reading through packets um I also saw where Portland I think just just just said we're doing this so yeah so you got a lot of data for you and Joan to kind of dig into on that perhaps but Joan you had a question as well um well I would um I'm wondering if um you did any research about what can be done with the batteries once they're expired I'm I haven't you know looked at it yet to see what what happens to them yeah I I think that's probably a good area of question right that's kind of the the externalities approach of like all right we make this decision how what's the cascading effects of that decision right and certainly the battery disposal and concerns there are uh are part of electric equipment that's a big concern with like electric vehicles and like what do we do with all of these things so um I the city might have some information on that but I think regardless kind of delving into that of how other cities are grapping that a good kind of point of inquiry for your for your um any did we want in terms of your and Juliana's ability to provide some of that data did you have thoughts on that yeah I just gonna C the the memo there's the comment that we we'd be happy to connect you with staff and and I mean I if if I don't know if Julian has capacity to write memos but we certainly could uh have interviews so can sit down with staff that knows the most you could you could you know ask questions of them and yeah yeah and I think what might be helpful for you in that endeavor if I can speak for you is is having from each of the Committees kind of a list of initial questions um that gets at that Baseline data so they know kind of what staff to bring into that interview so if you can sit down as your group and say okay what is it that we need to know just to get that kind of initial start in there and then and then they can kind of know what where they can say yes and here's some of the data around there or no we haven't looked into that to your point about batteries right like what's the what's the starting point so I think I think getting your group together and and kind of going over those initial points of inquiry will be helpful in in guiding staff's ability to support us so then should we connect with you rob or I I hate to put more on your plate or should we connect she'll make sure I yeah she'll make sure I don't miss the yeah yeah the inbox can be pretty over sometimes but she'll she'll make sure go for now all right I do want to underscore though I think that's helpful but I do think there should be things that Rana likely has that she could send out so I I would I would at least like to put in the request to her to see if there's things that like active transportation for example I know there's conversations on their way with chariots about U bike share and things like that so just any tidbits that she thinks are helpful even if I used memo very formally but I mean it very informally of like even if there's here's some links that you all should think about or here's this page from the climate action plan that you might want to know about and I imagine that a lot of that is living in a Google drive or Microsoft whatever folder that you all have that she might be able to farm out fairly easily so that's kind of where that request was coming from um and then process-wise two thoughts one is we have this three Monon um set of October to December I think it said for presentations uh yeah I'm wondering if we want to schedule those outs there's three groups we don't we can maybe check in in the summer and see where we're at but if we kind of have that Target of you know okay this is October we're doing this one November December and kind December yeah we can just give you December now the third committee so go I was expecting December my plan was to yeah do a touch point in kind of Midsummer in a few months see where groups are and and and work to schedule that out but um but to Rick's point we could go default I think some great but I I think at some point that'll help for all of us kind of know when when you really when you got I I will work to schedule that out before we get to October yeah that sounds great or at least before before we get before September I guess before September yes no I think that's a good um I had a different question I forgot it um well I had made the note too that I think us all leing with Juliana would be smart and so I think that's a reinforcing that that it would be a good goal kind of on this process we should all try and schedule meeting yes and I think with that uh with that idea um because I could see value there again kind of let's if you all can outline kind of what your questions might be um send those to me do that send those to me um and and and my thinking here is not wanting us to have three different me meetings with Juliana and asking 60% of the same questions right so can we maybe all try to get together or have her come for another board presentation that she can answer meetings or answer questions during our meeting that kind of uh consolidation of effort there rather than um loading down her time with with separate individual meetings and if I may a reminder the a Corum on sprp is five and just for I a little bit of buffer room I just it groups of three or or less communicated by email that would be my my preference but certainly never have more than five members on an email together that that's very important you're making the city lawyers proud you be hear it to three and have them forward it we also have to avoid that which is why you sent it to me and I will be the one that uh relases such foring of information um on myself I I just wanted to say that in terms of the electric uh uh chariots I mean I was on a committee there uh until recently um is transitioning to electric buses uh only a few at a time because uh they're very expensive and they're charging platforms and everything and so with the money being scarce that could be an issue for absolutely right so part",

        "text": " building per report to aggregate that data um also and I really appreciate the energy star list because I'm getting schooled here on our own regulations right this is all regulated by the Oregon Public Utility Commission uh how the confidentialities that we have to maintain with our customers we certainly have a huge database but we can't share most of it just by law um and looking at the the energy star list yeah we we do aggregate uh utility data for buildings with at least five meters or five tenants rather uh but not for multif family um and I I'm not sure if that's a a pu thing I I imagine it is I noce the same's true for PGE but not Pacific Power so I I don't know what what the differences are um the other thing is um well you mentioned this Blake if you have a a limited number of tenants sometimes you can tease out who's doing what right a data center versus like a little storage closet it's pretty obvious who's using the power yeah that that's the situation we're we're looking at and you know granted um I know the median is not the same as the average but if we're using the average eui by definition about half of the buildings that are covered would be required to comply I'm not thinking that half of those all excuse me I'm not thinking that that fraction is all multi-tenant necessarily but I'm going to guess that a lot of them are just given the size um so that turns into a lot of data collection for us um either that's another higher or some more automation or both and that would uh something be something we have to submit to the commission for consideration because that would affect rates ultimately yeah thanks thanks Kevin for those comments uh JP is see a hand yeah um I can address this from the a property owners's perspective um you know we have a lot of experience with the city of Portland's uh benchmarking which requires that we collect whole building data so we've been doing it for um I would say and and I appreciate Kevin's comments from the Utility side it's it's complicated I'm sure data is complicated and it's actually a big um it's a heavy lift um to collect data so I would say that if if if if there is a way of sort of streamlining data aggregation it would be massively helpful for everyone concerned but it's not an easy thing to do um I know for again for city of Portland benchmarking EG for example makes that fairly easy they can pull aggregate data from an address which is super helpful so then you might have you know 100 tenants in that address and you can get whole building data that way it's not it's not automated um that it would be super helpful if they if it was automated as in it was connected directly to Energy Star portfolio manager that would be a huge recommendation from my side I have colleagues in Seattle and Denver that um there are Utilities in those markets that have a connection to Energy Star portfolio manager where individual meters are aggregated and automatically push to Energy Star portfolio manager that is a huge benefit so any kind of legislation or recommendations to utilities to kind of help the own property owners like collect data would be hugely beneficial yeah yeah yeah and that that's it for me see Vin's hand up like you're muted oh sorry sorry I'm muted I was speaking Yeah I was just saying thanks JP for the comments um and I see Vin has a has a hand up yeah thanks I'll speak to City of Portland experience a little bit um and and personally just picking up where JP was going there with the automation um so Pacific Power through because they actually do benchmarking throughout the West Coast um they have the automated system set up um and it's you know it takes a minute to set it up because you want to confirm the right meters but then it is automated into Energy Star portfolio manager it's just that is the that's what would be the high bar I think of how to to do the the um work but then identify meters is a challenge so PG has uh the U we we've shared shape files of buildings with them so we have a building footprint layer that I think is fairly uncommon in other cities though and then PG has a GPS on every meter that they're able to assign and then identify and I think that's why your experience is and on that particular side is easier JP is because PG is saying here's the meters in your building and then it's just up to the owner to confirm that versus the opposite happens where um like this a power enough is natural uh the owner has to to go to the utility and say here identify the meters here are the meters and then there's some back and forth that happens to confirm that and then the the data is aggregated and provided in an Excel spreadsheet usually um that is formatted to be uploaded into portfolio manager but sometimes the format's off too because portfolio manager changes over time but I think probably key here though is um uh our our success in Portland is really hinges on uh the ability of Northwest Natural and other utilities Electric utilities to really be working to make it successful and um and I might be wrong about this now too Kevin but uh when we were originally setting up our our benchmarking policy knowing that data aggregation was key to success um because the other option is get tenant data releases but we wanted to avoid that option as much as possible and each the utilities kind of worked out a private company policy of five plus um that now we have a proposal for multif family that extends the the same concept if there's five or more meters then uh data aggregation there was just Comfort Comfort among the utilities that that was a reasonable um but I would I would think that uh you know we also have an exemption if for some reason the data is not available um and the Utility Partners have all been wonderful to work with um spefic power after our deadline this year so captured almost all the data aggregation was necessary but afterwards started having some some uh some challenges and so the exemption we actually offered a lot of exemptions because the data wasn't available in an aggregated form um rather than requiring 10 data release forms to be obtained uh by the property owners just it's arduous and for multif family it's would probably would not be possible to get all those dat releas forms so just some thoughts on that my overall recommendation would be like try to go for that you know the automated into portfolio manager system that pafic uses um and I think it'd be helpful to uh work with the PC and to establish rules that make it a a state policy rather than a utility Val utility policy that just have everybody on the same page of like this is how it does work just to assure for whatever reason that there's some responsibility and have an exemption because we can't predict the future and sometimes systems break down um and I think the utilities are always working on with improv to you know so there's just kind of a baseline here's what needs to be done and then allow each utility the flexibility to kind of get there on their own path like PG is um it I was hoping to have an automated system set up um this year that was different than the automated when the pafic PowerHouse and it didn't work out but I think next year we'll have that thought yeah thanks a lot Ben that's I think great perspective from you in the city of Portland having gone through the benchmarking process for a few years now um so good good comments thanks a lot um any other comments about utility energy data aggregation at this point I do see a comment in the chat from Egan um and I think that actually um goes more to the next item on the agenda for like how to deal with campus buildings um so if it's okay I'll just hold off on addressing that one just to make sure that we don't have any other comments or discussion on this energy data aggregation utility data aggregation piece um okay uh not hearing any so I think next we can move to um the next item on the agenda to continue the discussion that we have kind of had in some of the pass rack meetings around the scenarios of Campus buildings like if you have um you know simple scenario here if if you've got like one meter one it's say one electric meter that serves multiple you know Downstream U because it's an idiot that's why nope I'm hearing somebody speak um maybe they can M mute themselves um but uh so this is the scenario where you've got like one maybe like one meter that's serving multiple buildings and you know there's a scenario where you could have like two covered buildings under the same s by the same meter you know maybe those covered buildings are different different types so they might each have different targets but there's also scenarios where you know one meter might serve one covered and one uncovered building say one like large building that's over the the tier one threshold and then another 5,000 foot building that that isn't a covered building um you know you could certainly Envision other scenarios where it serves a tier one building and then a tier 2 building so um we've kind of uh laid out just a few different uh a few different scenarios and I'll kind of share my screen and hopefully this will kind of get some discussion going around this one too to illustrate um kind of how how we are approaching this and um gotten some clarification too about how this is approached in uh in Washington also but um so if folks can can kind of see that um see my screen but just a couple different scenarios to to discuss so you've got like a situation where you've got multiple covered buildings of size and type behind the same meter um so in that scenario there's you know really a few different options that um that we're proposing in this you know through this through the Draft rules for compliance um you know if each if if each of those buildings has a Target um you know so say they're all covered and they all have a Target um that Target UI can be based on the weighted average um of those buildings based on the square foot weighted average if they're all grouped together um if the owner chooses to maybe install a submeter to be able to separate those out those buildings could comply individually based on their own um you know their own measures and their own euis so in that scenario an owner could could choose the submeter install their own submeter um but it wouldn't necessarily be necessary wouldn't wouldn't be needed in order to comply there's other Pathways there too so then it becomes just an investment",

        "text": " that did is it directed state agencies to take actions to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions um as part of that you know many many agencies said hey we're going to look to do these things the department of energy was no different we had a series of tasks uh and within you know the department we the sighting division um had our own one of them was to look at the possibility of making changes um or having Council adopt your own noise rules um and so we spent some time looking at those opportunities uh we rejected the idea of coming up with your own rules because of um some conflicts that I won't get into between the DEQ noise rules um and so in the end we've come up with a proposal uh we've met with DEQ staff they've agreed to take on this rule making uh and it's uh solely related to solar PV so it's noise related to solar PV um because this is really more related to our projects or our jurisdictional projects your jurisdictional projects we're going to do much of the Staffing um on it um but because of the nature of it which I'm going to describe momentarily we don't believe it'll take that much effort um it'll it will take some effort absolutely um but we don't think it'll take a significant um so to go back in time a little bit to give you a little bit of framework for these changes in 2004 DEQ or in this case the Environmental Quality Commission because they're the ones who actually adopt the rules uh made changes to the noise rules specifically related to wind projects so these changes created some flexibility in the sighting of of wind facilities with regards to noise but still maintained important um thresholds so people wouldn't be impacted Ed negatively by um potential noise increases two primary things that those noise rules did was they allowed for an assumed ambient background Baseline noise level of 26 DVA um unless there is particular evidence in the record to show that that is higher now the importance of that is you know if you're going to hire a noise consultant to go out there and set up all the kind of um equipment and do that ambient noise monitoring it takes time and it's expensive um and so what this does is it allowed the developer to use an assumed ambient noise level and that's the 26 DPA so and again that was specific to wind not anybody else also it allowed for um noise sensitive properties these are homes schools hospitals basically places of of human kind of habitation that if the in increase is more than 10 DBA based on monitoring and and modeling um that they would have to get a waiver from the land owner so means that even if you know they can go from 26 to 30 you know five but if they go to 36 they would have to get waivers um and so it still allowed some control by those adjacent land owners um if they chose to sign the waiver or not sign the waiver now the one thing that's important about that is there is a not to exceed maximum threshold um which causes you know potential harm to humans and that table exists in the the rules that was not changed you can't you still can't go even if somebody was willing to sign a waiver you can't go above that so it just it's there's a not to exceed amount so again that was done in 2004 for wind facilities we've used that consistently since then it's been included in many of your reviews for wind facilities you know where developers often times for wind have chosen to do that because it's cheaper and easier and again still has the safeguards and there are numerous occasions where people have signed waivers so it's a system that has worked and you know created some flexibility but still safeguarded you know public health and safety really what we're doing is we're proposing the same thing just make this applicable to solar as well um because you know we want that same flexibility um it just doesn't exist right now people can't do those things um even if they want to so I think one element of this which is important to clarify in the record is many people ask well why are you even bothering with this because solar panels don't create noise and that is true but there are lots of equipment associated with industrial scale solar facilities that do create noise and those include inverters Transformers generator stepup Transformers transmission lines and then if they have a battery storage system the HVAC units associated with that and through our process or our reviews we have looked at that data we have the data in our record and the noise generated by those types of equipment range from 46 to 106 dbaa at the point source and the higher end of that well exceeds the not to exceed threshold so they have the potential to create significant health issues for people from from noise so you know there is a need to review noise for solar facilities uh there is a potential impact um but again because this has been done for wind facilities would have the same value uh and the same safeguards um so that's why we're proposing that so the idea is that we will create a rulemaking advisory committee and the reason I've gone to you with this is It's eqc or Environmental Quality commission Tomas already solicited uh uh you know interest in a rule making advisory committee we will likely just show them in a one-time meeting here's the Draft rules which is pretty surgical um making sure that there are no concerns or issues or if somebody has a different idea on language then um once that concludes we would initiate that process do a uh public comment period a rul making hearing um and then ultimately it would go to the Environmental Quality commission with the potential to be adopted as early as May of next year so any questions any questions uh Cindy Con in for the record um just maybe not related to this but I'm just wondering um we do a lot of our work is an analysis of Fish and Wildlife impacts on Fish and Wildlife and this is just human just human um um and nothing with is there anything out there with respect wildlife near solar wind wind facilities I mean there there can be so when we look at those standards there are prot when you if you look at protected areas um or recreation resources there are noise elements to those those are not the DEQ noise rules those are if you have a protected area or a recreation resource and some element of that you know and say the management plan for that is you know a quiet sort of setting we would look at potential impacts of noise from the facility to that similarly you know we would if there were you know noise issues associated with you know sensitive fishal wild of habitat we would work with with ODFW regarding that I'm not aware of any particularly that that's occurred certainly you know if ODFW you know some you know nesting species During certain times of the year they were very sensitive to noise that would be something that could get included in our review I'm making that up but but but it's possible I I just had had I had the experience of anite hearing report about um know um with actual figures for you can't go above certain Deo level so you council member Byer thank you um just a quick question the only project that I've been involved with that we really got into the noise standard was the b2h transmission line and in that case um there was an allowance for mitigation uh to address the noise issues is that a component of the existing wind okay and then it's a component of the existing DEQ noise rules okay okay that was the question so those could be rolled forward to solar as well if necessary in this example for wind and what we're proposing in solar you know if you if you go above 10A so you doing 26 and you're say you know at 27 and you got to go to the land owner you know the land owner can negotiate they could basically say build me a sound wall replace my windows put insulation in um or or just get get me some money and all sign labor you know I think there's a lot of then power within the hands of the particular land owner good I I appreciate the effort to do this Ru making and to kind of set that Safe Harbor for developers so they don't have to assess the ambient level because that's that's got to be a tough charge so um I appreciate staff working with DEQ to to address that issue thank you um next on my list is there is an existing battery energy storage system working group um so you know as you are aware we most of our certain solar facilities include a battery storage component um the use doesn't exist in statute or rule um in the exclusive Farm use zone so for us it's just a related and supporting Facility by itself it's it doesn't exist uh as an allowed use so that's what the group is really looking um at the end of the uh 2023 session uh there was a bill house bill 2989 in a-2 um there was an attempt um and so that's what this group is starting with is that-2 amendment and then having some conversation so it's a representative Marsh from Ashlin um she's the one who's leading it and if there are uh agreements her intent is to have this done during the 2024 short session so this would be a statutory change um I'm going to give you a little background uh for those non-land use people um really what they're looking at is the exclusive Farm use Zone that's where most of our facilities are located that's where I think the likelihood of most of these um there are three types of review uses within the exclusive Farm use Zone the first which isn't really a review use it's it's a use by right farming you can Farm in the exclusive Farm you Zone you don't have to ask permission you can just do it there's no review there's no no questions about that um the next is what's referred to as a type one use and so if you look at the statute the exclusive Farm use Zone it'll have type one and type two and the type one uses are very minimal review and and you're limited to what the statute includes so you can't the local governments cannot add additional requirements outside of some minimal public health and safety requirement so there is some provision for that but largely Counties have to implement and and and Council has to implement what is in that particular um described use then you have the type two uses which are conditional uses there are then quite a few elements within the land conservation and development commission statutes",

        "text": " let's go on with the other issues sort of black yeah and just to Echo what secretary corn I said earlier you know my job here is to uh provide you with your options and and recommendation and the reasons for my recommendations that this is your your decision okay the the second really big issue and this is one that came up and I think almost every comment that we received uh well not not almost every comment but um the vast majority of comments uh and you can see these exhibit numbers that I've listed on all these things are are tied to the index and you're attachment to to your staff report which I think include self comments so and that is that in each of the three um that we are proposing to amend or that the council is proposing to amend uh the council has included a cool post language uh that as I said before uh states that the amended standards would only apply to the review of applications and requests for amendment that are still in the preliminary request phase um it would not apply to review of complete applications that the council's already received so as an example uh the West End solar project that application complete application was filed in September the council just issued or the department just issued the DPO um if you were to about these rules today uh they would not apply to the review of that uh project for your final part of the reason the council did that was to avoid requiring applicants to go back in the process if they could have gone to a certain point and um also I think just based on the principle of kind of uh avoiding unfair surprise of the last minute changes all right so uh issue there's really two kind of sub issues contained in the comments there's objections the first is like a policy consideration just that the council shouldn't be applying an outdated review to any of its decisions uh even if that uh would inconvenience the certificate um I think you'll see throughout the comments that that uh the commenters think that it's an issue of fairness that uh you know to the public that decisions will be made on on rules that they see as outdated um and rules that we ourselves have kind of also agree are outdated and that's why we're amending them now the second and maybe more I guess needy issue or or less discretionary issues a legal issue and that is that a lot of the commenters said that they believe that those goal post Provisions are uh inconsistent with the requirements of ors-469401 section two in that section of statute requires that uh any certificate holder require the council and the certificate holder to abide by local ordinances and state law and rules of the council in effect on the date of the site or amended side certificate is executed um and I think uh so as I understand it and I will definitely defer to your legal counsel if you have legal questions about this but my understanding is that that statute is uh really required are really intended to make it so if a new like Environmental Protection Law or a new public health and safety law is passed between the time that the council or the Department issues the project order and the council makes its final decision and the council does not take the opportunity or the council department does not take the opportunity to amend the project order to bring that new uh into the process and evaluate it um it still requires the certificate holder in the council to abide by that law at the end of the process so um once the decisions made the the site certificates are executed you can't just ignore something that happened in the meantime there is a carve out for local ordinances those of local 80s regulations are controlled rs469504 and there is a a goal post in the statute that basically says uh once the preliminary application is filed um you know no neutral board so this and that was uh I think maybe I won't I won't uh kind of guess guess what the intent there was but um that is a separate issue um so I think there is some ambiguity in what that statute means for the council standards those standards aren't something with an ongoing compliance requirement those are something that apply to you and your decisions so there is an implication that the council changes its rules while a process is ongoing that the council does need to apply those updated rules uh to your decision at the end of the process but that doesn't mean that you can't within those rules State how they will apply so we think that the school post language where you say the standard for complete applications on or after the state is the standard is is the standard that was in effect when they start all right the commenters disagree with that approach um but but that's kind of where the where the the thickness is I guess so this is the weeds that that this issue is in um I will say it is you know it is a difficult thing it is an issue of statutory interpretation I'm not sure I have a great answer on this um we did provide both um some additional language in the amended standard that would clarify that just because there's these goal posts we do not believe the goal post waive the obligation of the certificate holder or the council to abide by ordinances state laws or other rules of the council uh that were in effect that they decided to be this executed so basically this is saying if there was a uh it's a trying to think of some protected area that's designated to law and I will say this it gets confusing because there's there's a goal post issue with the designations themselves that I'll talk about next but um so if if there was a new uh just as a verification so probably the easiest way to think about this this particular Point here could apply to any rulemakings yeah so the the next one is going to talk about is specific to protected areas yeah that helps to kind of distinguish them um you know this would be kind of going back to my comment before you know we're looking for a same kind of model um should Council want to do a goal post in you know a future rulemaking related to something entirely different than protected areas so this would be a general type of one whereas yeah but the next one that Chris is going to talk about is specific to the protected area distributions yeah so to avoid monitoring others further out stop there I will say so we we've recommended this additional language that basically clarifies you know this doesn't mean that um 469 4012 does not apply uh syllables and this is this is how um the alternative would be you can just duplicate the entire existing standards and it will under the school post section so that it's it's extremely clear what standard you will be applying to those pending we've included that alternative text in the amended notice too I will obviously I'll be going forward one of them um but that is a decision we'd love to you to make so Marcy this is coming from a lens finding background I strongly believe in a complete application being the demarcation for complete application is you know I think that's fair to everybody so I I strongly support post designation for a complete application and uh and I guess I'll leave it up to Patrick and tell us to talk a little bit about the why it might be necessary for list talk together are you reading the law into protected areas or uh sure yeah if you were done with this issue we can we can move on to it that's the similar issue related objectives because you can correct me if I'm wrong I don't think you need to make the choice apart from one option two today that still would be potentially at the December if it comes back December final well if the council agrees with our recommendation to go out with this amended notice you will have another opportunity to revise the proposed rules before dedicate because there'll be more comments yeah because there'll be another comment period um and that comic period will be open to everything including this issue um we we have received so many comments on us that I am hoping there are not new issues but you know um so uh this wouldn't be your final decision but as far as what we put in the notice you do have to make a decision about which way you think is I would say which way you think is the best way to go um and then if you decide you want to go the other way later you still can but um we do need to put one or the other on campus so we could not include both options even if there was a preferred option that's articulated today would have to do some research on whether or not they actually allow you to uh to do that I I'm assuming the secretary of state will reject okay that um actual filing but notice it with those rules and so it actually has to be a rule set that theoretically could be adopted as such status so that when you move options at that okay so often then correct myself sounds like you do have to figure out which one you like better um so Kelly I just want to make sure I understand what sure are you saying you're a supportive of option two or do you not like what's an option one no I like option one because I think it's simpler and clearer option two repeats on the list and gets computed it was confusing to me the first time I read it yeah but I'm you know I'm willing to understand what is the best as far as the legal Egos and I'd like to hear from Patrick as to why option two might be more legally sad uh for the rulemaking if that is the case but I prefer and just now just a follow-up question to you so um this what is added here is intended to kind of um speak to the statute uh and I'm just I was wondering the step ask actually isn't mentioned is that is there a reason for putting this option you know um if it's intended to draw attention it's not even the intention is that this statute still applies but no reference to the stashing council member content um I think it was just an editorial decision you could add that reference if you wanted to process in the writing so learning every day thank you um and council members I guess one one further just clarifying thing is that as soon as a decision is reached on whatever pending applications are out there these sections would no longer be operable they'd come out effect so the concept that I whichever way you go the next time we touch these rules this section will be deleted of course if we're making other substantive commitments you may want to do another goal post um cool at that time but uh",

this excess head off we would be in the range of what 125 130 PSI so to operate our system efficiently we have to kill that or burn that excess head how do you do that so what we do right now is we have control valves right so think about it's a it's a like a ball valve that you would see you know like on a on a PVC pipe so we we crack it a little bit right so the the the KE do you want to explain it he's he's my he's my process engineer so picture you're watering delicate flowers and you've got all this pressure coming on your right sorry turn your spigot a little bit down I just did this yesterday so I know so you turn the spigot down and the pressure decreases so that your flower survive being water that's consistently killing head and and and and the head if you want to do a Newtonian physics it's called potential energy basically the higher water pressure is that potential energy the higher you've got that gravity or that that distance you've got that energy and the energy got to has to go somewhere either fiddle with a STI or what what we're gonna try to do is pull off outlet and turn turn turn that turn the turban notice hand just turn tur that and then back in again so that's how we're going to do so basically right now we're wasting that potential correct and instead we're gonna capture so what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna fiddle with the spigots here and here got it see now you're f with the we're GNA fill with the spigots and instead of just letting that that excess energy just burn off we're going to capture it in terms of electricity what I've learned here is that I'm going to start using the term kill the head please when I'm doing anything with the hose can you kill the head a little that's what that's what I'm taking from this lesson and I'm gig yeah so yeah so in layman's terms we're GNA fiddle with the space how much is this fiddling going to generate um well go go back one I just want to this is this is fr and Reservoir so this is a proposed uh site go to the next one yeah um go to that right so two sites uh Turner control FR in so this is our average energy production per year so 62,000 kilowatt hours and 88,000 kilowatt hours oh can you translate that into like how many houses that runs or give us an idea be about 150 150 homes yeah very here I mean yeah hour yeah so it's not necessarily all the time but they're running about all the time it yeah it would so the the regardless of how much water comes into town right so when we're running at our Max day demand let say 50 million gallons per day or when we're you know in a time like we are right now as water uses is starting to ramp up but in the winter time we're running around 22 23 million gallons St the amount of water flowing isn't NE necessarily what generates this power it's the pressure differential right and because this is on our transmission line all the water that's being used has to come through these two points yeah so it runs 24 hours a day 365 days a year so it's just a constant turn um and then the way this this is set up if you can imagine you've got a you got a large transmission line um that's 69 in in diameter we'll take a 24 in pipe off of it bypass it out of that main transmission line into our hydrogenerator and then back into the natural water stream which allows us flexibility we have to do you know we don't want anything that that takes our transmission lines offline in the event that we need to do routine maintenance so because it's set up as a bypass and this water is constantly flowing all day long um it will its normal course will be through the bypass into the generator and then back in but if we have to do repairs or actually when we put the thing in we don't have to take the transition off W and what's this going to cost all right back up feel I had a feeling there was so uh this is for the first s $1.4 million these incentives are just a rough idea we're still working on exactly what you know what the incentives are like uh infrastructure reduction act so there's money from the federal government there's money from Department of energy there's money from Energy Trust um this actually this less than five years comes into uh are you familiar with net metering yes okay I have PS okay all right so so these incentives assume net metering which makes this Pro go ahead oh yeah which which appears to make this project uh the payback uh more attractive but as julan has probably told you in prev metering is is not really the way to go because these are not energy intensive sites so at uh at this site there's actually no power used except for you know the valve actuators and then a Turner control site uh we have you know some skater panels and some light bulbs that what's that skat supervisory control and data acquisition this so it's the computer network that runs our entire much power there yeah so we don't so a net metering at these sites doesn't make sense because we would actually be putting more power into the grid than what we're actually going to be using and PGE at this point these are both PGE sites PGE doesn't have a program set up that really allows us to capture all this excess energy that we be putting into the grid so Juliana is working with PGE on was it the Green community incentives or uh green uh Community ter me talked about that March yeah and uh I think your previous council meeting the the last one in March March April March for the grant uh no that was the council meeting yeah that one was the one so we brought we brought together a proposal that that was uh it was through Oregon Department of energy and what we're looking for is to get money to fully fund the design of this so the idea is that we will Design these two sites have them um basically shovel ready and then shop it for as the incentives start to come online and we'll be shopping it as a project that's ready to go great so that is cost of one reservoir and here similar costs less than three year payback assuming at me these you know the incentives and we've talked to the energy trust and you know they've basically uh said that you know get this thing ready we will make sure that you have a payback period of less than five years for the project and this would all be coming out of our uity fund cor right so the idea is that we would um the Utility Fund would you know we would put up the money to for the capital costs and then we would use the incentives to offset those Capital costs they would come back into the Utility Fund so you know you're talking about an investment of a few hundred, for something that's you know still pretty unique um City of Hillsboro has one uh a similar situ it's at right across the parking lot from B ton field um theirs is nice because it's in a public area and they have you know signage and you know all the lights at the Ballpark are powered by this you know by this generation or this hydrop power generation unfortunately because where these sites are we're not going to really be able to I mean we can we can take tours and show people but it's going to be behind fences and in a very sensitive area so it's not the type that you know we can really advertise and show off yeah but it will be something that we can point to as our for our clate action plan I mean this goes with our you know our Solar power generation that we have um this is just another feather in that hat of removable energy what about some of our other reservoirs that we have like over in West Salem South Salem we have you know we have we have other Reservoir sites are there there potential better no not really why because we we don't have the spigot to F to fiddle with uh we're not we're not trying to burn head once we get into town okay so now we're we're basically uh we're on system pressure right so we're in that 60 to 80 psi r that we and so we don't have any access excess energy to burn off we have looked at uh our ASR Wells because I I know it's gonna be super smart I'm ready Aqua for storage and recovery system right so in the winter time we put our water into an underground aquer and in the summertime during Peak demands we pull that water out uh to supplement the water that's coming from our par and Water Treatment Plant when we when we're injecting water it's system pressure that's feeding U these injection sites and then the water magic just goes down a hole so there is potential then to capture that excess energy excess energy as it goes down into the aquifer um a system like this doesn't really make sense because it's uh it doesn't run year round and so it's only running about three months out of the year so investing in a in a system like this isn't really the way to go so what we're looking at our regenerative drives on our pumps so basically they backwards as the water goes down and that that U generates power it's going to be it's really small scale compared to what we're talking about control but there is there is another potential side the incentives on that one because it doesn't run that much really make it about a 15 or so year payback period and we're still working on possible incentives to to see if we can make that one a reality as well I'd just like to add a piece of note so one of the things that we really are excited about for this project is it doesn't require any energy to run it's what they consider a black start so in catastrophic grid failure scenarios a black start system would be able to generate energy without any energy in and that is uncommon for a lot of Renewables it's normally relied on or fossil F so both solar and wind require some electricity on the grid to be Al so and this one because we're just harnessing the",

        "text": " so we those roll together so we're constantly looking at how do we improve the system so the next time we have a response it's better and I think uh in the actual implementation use of those funds uh I think to you know maximize their their efficacy it it goes to to uh the you know the third aspect of I think you know the commission the bo board kind of Commissioners role uh I you know definitely understand the the coordination uh and the um the continuity is something that you already see Rec recognized uh by the the staff's efforts to date um I think that kind of that first aspect though is really where the Commissioners can come into play and that's the prioritization it's the that uh the that you have you support the identification of um aspects of the county ordinances that might inhibit the use of those funds is there are there ways in which funds are allocated and distributed in budgets uh in different pots of money that um might make perfect sense on a sunny day but when it comes to actually utilizing those uh in an emergency for uh staff or purchasing resources materials and supplies could they inhibit the response and I think one of the goals of of of talking to the board today um is to raise your level of awareness that as this AR process unfolds there could be um certain uh actions identified that only the board can take in order to achieve an improvement uh are there aspects of the way funds are are going to be distributed and spent and approvals that provide great accountability on a regular day-to-day basis uh but might create uh obstacles to an effective response and I think a staff will you know um recognize that value most and and recognize um uh the openness to Solutions um with the you know recognition that this is something that is worthy of of prioritization of effort and energy among staff as they uh do this after inter action process if I may make a connection uh so part of my understanding is John and Adrian will be coming to you multiple times uh to continue to give you updates um and like Miss Angie said uh about their progress and with that uh we internally as staff uh are going to be working on tabletops and exercises and trainings and so part of uh Greg being here today uh we are going to be meeting with Adrian and John and our HHS director Mira samle this afternoon to discuss what would benefit Washington County for the next training what did we learn what do we want to incorporate what do we want to test and so um we are leveraging this opportunity as what can we do to celebrate our successes and um continue to improve into your um to your point chair Harrington how do we help support future boards okay any other Commissioners one comment to you Greg let me you mentioned a few times that you're an attorney my background is I'm a CPA I've been doing it a long time I make a lot of presentations to a lot of groups and uh feel a little bit that this what of smiling about it I feel like they're when I make my presentation they're probably saying my goodness this is a little more complicated than I really want to be involved with and it's not something that I I I'm going to deal with on a daily basis because each of us come with different skill sets yeah I'll lead up to my what what I want to say and that is a you got a lot of people here with a lot of passion about a subject and that's the subject you're interested in as well but you know what's really interesting to me just me not the rest of the board but to me and that is not so much the details not so much what's happening because I don't have the expertise to do that you want to talk about a host of business activities I can do that with you all day but what's the gold standard and are we somehow achieving that so when I issue financial statements with an opinion on them I'm saying you did what you were supposed to do when the staff brings this I'm pleased I know it's important it's good work I I'm glad that we do it we need to have it done but I have no no idea whether it's just as good as the one down the road or the one over the next block I really don't know so as you go around the country wouldn't it be nice if either I don't want to call an accreditation program or some kind of a of a look through uh could you do that because to me we can Pat ourselves in the back all day long and that's nice of us to do that but it'd be nice for future boards to the point or even us to say I don't have to worry about that you know we've done the best we've had somebody at a federal level said that's what you need to do and we can sleep at night satisfied that we're prepared so so what do we do to get to that point yeah um it's something that organizations like um n as well as uh ASO the association of state and territorial Health officials have been doing uh is is putting together these um best practices toolkits and menus some of these effective uh methods and and policies and strategies that jurisdictions have developed make them available uh for folks in in a wide variety of jurisdictions to utilize I think one key aspect of that is the uh bestowing of innovation Awards upon certain Health departments for some of the Innovative practices like the one that you all receive and the the purpose of that is yes to uh you know recognize good work that was done uh for the benefit of of those individuals who did that work but I think most importantly those uh Awards highlight particular effective Public Health practices that others could emulate and model and dualize going forward and so all of those aspects uh are what informs the individual assistance that I provide when I go out to jurisdictions and the the knowledge that I collect and it's also uh what informs you know the broader institutional recommendations uh and and going forward uh CDC is including administrative preparedness as a preparedness capability uh and and providing guidance for the roles of uh the you know individuals who are writing plans and developing exercise all the way up to the policy makers of the jurisdiction to help them understand the different roles when it comes to identifying and potentially uh resolving barriers to an effective response and so uh it's it's very much trying to make sure that we are recognizing a variety of effective practices because jurisdictions are very varied uh and and finding you know many different uh forms of communicating that to individuals through everything from me coming to a jurisdiction and uh answering questions about particular scenarios and what I've seen other jurisdictions do in the past to those bigger broader kind of institutional uh recommendations and and and guidance for Effective uh use of government resources for emergencies if I may I know we probably need to wrap up uh so um let me respond you can then you can well my apologies yeah that's all right thank you you've described that you're developing toolkits and best practic that doesn't get to the point let me tell you what the point really is when somebody goes to their attorney they say am I reasonably protected do I reason do I have some comfort some reasonable standard that that that that's been applied wouldn't it be wonderful again at the level that you're at if there was some oversight or some sort of internal audits you do or something it said yes you've you've indeed Incorporated all the best practice without an outside look this is my opinion nobody else just mine we can take all information you give us all day long and say that's the best practice that's great but nobody's saying we implemented and what did we do for those who follow us and for the public if we really didn't have someone in essence certify or somebody to look at it and say you did a good job so that that's where I'm going just I'm just giving you feedback honestly I understand thank you this is where things like accreditation really help us yes yeah yes um I don't really want to wait for years uh before somebody plays back to me the detail of what you described what somebody thinks my role as an elected official is I know how crappy it felt during coid um but I don't know if I'm in alignment or even on the in the same universe as what CDC thinks my role is or isn't um so I don't know where to go with that thought but commissioner Willie you haven't had a chance no I've just been listening to a lot of this stuff i' the the information that's on the screen there was intriguing to me um but I have to admit I don't know what an lhd is local Health Department oh okay um so so anyway that was just interesting the Dynamics of um shortfalls I guess that you've identified in there but other than that it's been it's been an interesting conversation it's it's kind of new stuff for me from the standpoint of just um I've always thought oh Katherine's got this so I don't need to I am blessed yeah with the board that I have served on through pandemic through the Wildfire crisis we had emergency in 2020 and these colleagues I think continue to do marvelous work in investing Federal resources that we have so we I think tend to have we have a track record of being willing to lean in and lap this stuff up and apply it for service to our community um so I look forward to learning a little bit more so it doesn't feel like it's so over my head I guess I should have said we have great staff that do this because this this is really to me very complex and um just knowing that y'all's working on that that's I'm good enough for that thank you and uh just to I'll turn this over Miss Angie um just to kind of summarize part of the reason why Greg is here is because this is a celebration of the leadership of Washington County that the award that was mentioned uh was in response to your board's actions um and so we look forward to pulling that out of the archives and sharing that with you it's really a celebration and building on that success hey I really missed the message and and so cator so why why Washington County Washington county is the local public health authority right the No No City within our boundaries has a public health department or role and your leadership when you when you add your local public health authority hat that allows an opportunity to impact all jurisdictions across the county and you have leveraged and leaned in as you've said um to using your local Health public health authority governing body hat to past policies to improve the health and well",

        "text": " yeah it has not improved so it would be nice if it did but it's your friend just more this is empire for the record just more on the water thing I think it would be helpful if staff can get some documentation on a critical grandmother um designation and I can't I I worked in Umatilla coming years ago and I can't remember if that's a state designation or in part of the County's comp plan so just coming around because I've looked at the Aerials and I thought well it's a donut hole that doesn't have water how did that happen and the rules changed and and water is less available but but um documenting the critical groundwater area would be really helpful knowing that we know that the Irrigation District can't or can't serve has done more water runs but that would help really say that no this this can't be formed we aren't taking away um Brown that could throw watermelons because there's just not enough water so thank you so I have one more question for you okay this is handling we have in the graph or post border material that we have talks about property that is to the East and Northeast that hadn't been formed in the past but is being farmed now um and sounds like it's being formed with high value crops like corn and beans and so forth um yeast so have you explored other crops besides and I'm somewhat familiar I'm from Unity County yeah now um we have a lot of different props up in Union County and and I understand wheat is one of the least demanding of water crops but I was very interested that there are adjoining properties here that are farming with very similar soils that almost exactly the same soils as doesn't our information doesn't say whether it's irrigated or not but my assumption is that it's not and it's and it's been recent yeah do you have any information related to that is all irrigated it is now always yes it is all irrigated at this time yes right our two two places at this Western solar project is is uh program for our there is irrigated around it but these two places haven't had it when I when I planted my first crop there was a gentleman that that worked for my son-in-law's family that was 80 years old and was out there and helped you know he was doing some some work and he come up to me and he said uh Steve he says you're the first guy that I ever remember this is and I'm 80 years old I've never seen anybody farm this ground and I said so why he says because there's no water so our record says this is handling again our record says that it was farmed in the 50s and 70s okay again prior to your ownership yeah yeah and it might have been but uh I can't remember his name uh but he said that he never even as a kid remembered anybody farming around it'd be great if it had water I'd love it's all the questions I have thank you again thank you Mr Scott thank and then next is Arthur Pryor my name is Arthur Pryor the I 32313 Oregon Trail Road Echo Oregon I'm here to support the West End solar I happen to be one of the landowners of course and um kind of reiterate what Steve was saying my land has never been farmed that I know of and I've never farmed it it's outside of all district boundaries it has no water rights and it has a large BPA Line running right through it so it has to me little or no income any capacity unless I get a solar project a solar farm going on um so from my perspective this is a really really great opportunity to create some income and maybe some alternate source of income to help take out the roller coaster effects and the ups and downs of being in the farming um this is I've been just a few of these meetings before and this is a clean energy close to the grid project it's just there's no transmission lines it shouldn't affect any neighbors or any which is always that underlying worry that there's going to have to be a transmission lie because a lot of these projects are built a long ways away from the grid and so this is a kind of a unique project I've I've testified in other cases where I ask the people I love your project just don't try to create a transmission line through my farming property so and which is a heartbreaking situation for any Farm ground or anything so this is um this is my opportunity to do something with this lab my banker loves this project and um we've owned this property since about 1990 that was never really an attempt to farm this quarter section it just is outside of all district boundaries it has no water and it just is a feudal effort to try to grow wheat you can do it there's a lot of new technologies these days that you can use chemicals and different techniques and and no-till minimum-till procedures but it is just it's just next to impossible to make a living off of that ground I'm here to support this project and do whatever I can to create a solar farm I'd like to answer any questions you guys have if there's anything I can help persuade you guys so this is Hanley again I do have some um I'll ask you the same questions I have Steve's gone do you farm other land in the area yes you do yes so have you tried to obtain water rights for the property so that is a complicated question um the land you were referring to that's East and to the north is also part of my property that I've just recently but you can answer my next question so why didn't you put water on that land I was just talking to so an analogy would be if you own 100 acres of real estate and you have water for 10 acres where are you going to put that 10 acres of water you're going to put it close to the irrigation system you're going to put it on the most productive land and what are you going to do with the rest of it you you just don't have a an abundant source and a unrestricted source of water it's it's it's it's it's a very very it's easy for me to say you're in the you're in sub-area a me and Steve are in the sub area in that area and if I want to drill and get into the basalt layer it's a zero start from the very beginning they will not allow you to it's impossible the state wants us off of all of our groundwater they I don't know if you can draft that con concept but they really do not want us to um be pumping it and there's an sa why in sub-area a and they are restricting that a little bit more all the time because the groundwater keeps going down so you say you own the property to the East and the Northeast and that's referred to in part materials I think you were referring to it when you were talking to Steve right some new developed land yes yeah and so is that land irrigated some of it is some some of it is yes and that isn't irrigated is it cropped no it's not a problem no the the part that isn't irrigated wasn't CRP and it expired trying to develop as we go along and so the high value crops that are mentioned in here corn and so forth are irrigated crops they're on those Parcels they're adjacent to your to this subject no there I don't understand adjacent well they're adjacent they're connected they're connected um across the road but um they are right so we're going to try to bring a map there's one in one point talking about this right here right yes so even though that's that is now irritated no it's really actually not but it's bad so there there is some sections connected to that real estate if you were to get a map that would cover uh two miles Square that is being irrigated and that's where you're growing those things I developed some real estate and I leased it out to a guy who's growing organic stuff and uh so so let me run by you what we've got here okay it says um and this is under um wind-blown branches and it says on tax lots east and Northeast subject of the site boundary has historically not been irrigated and was uncultivated however recently these tax lots have been planted with peas corn and potatoes so what that says to me is is the same as your property are being producing peas corn and potatoes but I don't this doesn't say whether that land is irrigated or not so you know for me I need to know if I'm going to approve an exception to taking this land out of an agricultural Zone and authorizing it for Solar Development I need to know whether or not it could be used for agricultural purposes and and and part of being used means it needs to be you you need to be successful it needs to be profitable and so you know I appreciate Steve's comments about you know I didn't you know I said we didn't make any profit from this production but peas corn and potatoes are high value props and if they could be grown on this parcel without irrigation that's very important to whether or not I can agree with this exceptions um to stabilize Planet goal three so I need to know either from you or from somebody the applicant whether or not those adjoining properties are so that's that's a very complicated to be outside of a District boundary is uh not a good thing to try to be included in that in that basic boundary is a very very long it's a um it's almost next to Impossible it has to be a I'm not so sure the state has to be the um I'm not so sure the bureau doesn't have to be involved and I've never actually I've been in this area farming for 36 years continuously and I've never seen or heard of anyone actually an Irrigation District including land that hasn't been in their District ever before it just doesn't happen there's probably a more a more detailed explanation than that but even if there was water in those they are extremely reluctant or next to impossible to try to ask them to include land that is not in that District um for the simple reason that everyone else is going to want to be included you know throughout history Farmers have migrated to areas that had less water but better capabilities better ground and those things just don't change very easy so so let me let me see if I can re-ask the question okay so the property immediately to the across the road to the East and to the Northeast I'm being told is",

        "text": " near and dear to our hearts all these things are near and dear to our hearts I don't even know why I said um but this area is really about getting a broad understanding of what people are interested in Red Energy and that comes down to we send out a um a survey to people to tell us what are you interested in what are the questions you have around energy to we just listen in the meetings that we go to and the conferences that we attend to the topics that are seen as sort of the top of Mind things that people are interested in Hot Topics if you will and we also engage um stakeholders and others to understand sort of what their what they're thinking about as far as the energy World goes and then last we just do a lot of research on things happening at the state level Regional level nationally and even globally to understand what what things people are thinking about around the world that might be informative or useful to discussions going on in Oregon so um I I'd like to think that we have sort of a very broad approach to how we determine what these are and then how we Whittle it down to those subjects is I could talk for 20 minutes about that process it's a very lengthy process that involves a lot of discussion and um long meetings but if you're interested in more reach out to me happy to talk to you about it um the next question that I have Michael Kara asked and she was really interested in what odo's role is with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission or Public Utility Commission um in in how they're working on the clean energy plan particularly with how our Natural Gas Utilities are working on those plans yes well thank you for the question Cara I appreciate it so as you probably know so we don't have a formal role in and uh supervising or working on the integrated resource plans uh but we do try to our goal is ultimately to inform policy discussions so we do work with puc and then we work with the utilities separately and have a conversations with them and try to follow the the IRP process and also other state agencies so for example DEQ with their climate Protection Program development having conversations with them and and uh and tracking the the development of the client Protection Program and other things that are going to influence those Natural Gas Utilities But ultimately our goal is is kind of work behind the scenes and hopefully inform the policy um and you know work with those utilities about the with the state policies and programs and see what we can do to inform that process and make sure we're whether it's a report like the viral Energy report providing an accurate view of what's happening within the market I know I'm on mute I got it I got it um if anybody has any follow-ups to what Michael just said throw them in the chat and I'll happily pass them on to him um thank you Michael for that great presentation and the the answer that you've got there um for Kara's question and Amy I had another question from Cara which is what are other states doing in engaging in energy strategies and are there any lessons that have been learned from those processes in other states yeah so that's a great question um so the short answer is yes several states have either developed State energy strategies or develop climate action plans that are very similar to a state energy strategy and we have been looking at um several of those plans of the state of Washington developed a state energy strategy that we think provides a pretty good example of what a state energy strategy in Oregon might look like I guess I would just editorialize that I think their their strategy is is um I think Oregon would benefit from a similar strategy but one that expands a little bit further into the analysis into different electricity specific California also has done has created a plan that is more electricity focused New York has a plan um that there are there are many plans and I'm happy to follow up and provide more examples um if you'd like but some of the key lessons that we've learned um relate to the types of of different policy mechanisms that you include in your plan matter and the type of stakeholder the stakeholder engagement process that you apply in developing that plan really matters and how you incorporate Equity into the into the plan really matters and I think that the Washington State energy strategy is a really great example um for how you not only develop a plan that's a living document that provides recommendations that can evolve over time but they employed a really robust stakeholder process in developing their plan and they Incorporated a variety of initiatives and processes and Outreach to really ensure that Equity was front and center in the development of their plan and I think they've just did a really good job there and it provides a really good example of what Oregon could also do thanks Amy great um great answer uh I would like to think that Oregon is like we're at the perfect spot where we're not the first people to do something so we can learn from other people's work and mistakes um but we get there up on the front end so that we're able to take advantage of things early on that's that's our sweet I don't have any other questions in the chat but we do have we have 12 more minutes if there are questions to to discuss here feel free to throw them in the chat happy to to answer them and while we're giving folks just a few more minutes to get those questions into the chat I'll call our Collective attention to the

us are going to be here tonight the rest are on screen our chair is on the East Coast visiting with her mother we've got two Commissioners who have family members who are ill or they are ill themselves and I have a great amount of courtesy they said they won't be here in person so there'll be two of us commissioner William myself here tonight for those of you who are here the first time and may not have been with us before you'll see that we'll call to order the board and then we'll go through some Public Communication it's 10 minutes total at the beginning which means two minutes a piece that's only five I understand commissioner oily may make a motion to break that and that's the way you do it in our formal rules then we're going to go through a consent agenda and then we'll have a hearing and then we have time at the very end if two minutes is not quite enough we have some time at the very end of our program that up to five minutes per person so Kevin would you go ahead

commissioner FYE I'm here commissioner trees commissioner Willie here Vice chair Rogers here chair Harrington thank you very much again it's my understanding commissioner Worley mentioned that he had invited some folks tonight there's more than obviously five of them who want to speak for two minutes and you have a request that the board expand the 10 minutes until How long I would like to ask my fellow Commissioners to extend the 10 minutes to allow for the I believe it is 12 people to give us a two-minute communication which is covering both Forest Grove and another topic so I would like for us to consider extending the 10-minute time limit I cannot see anybody on my screen we have screens up here as well so I'm going to turn my back to you I apologize did anybody opposed to that or can we extend it up there's one two okay it looks like your uh you're granted you're so uh Kevin would you just uh expeditiously go through that list and hopefully what you can do is not give us redundant uh communication because into in the oral communication we won't correspond with you we'll simply take that in and we'll have our staff give us a report later on and we'll examine the issue so Kevin please yeah and please uh there will be a clock up on the screen so if you would please be considerate of staying within your two minute timeline that would be great thank you all right thank you Mr Vice chair commissioner Willie so I will just call you up two at a time here so first we have David witchert and Skip Bueller can we get our screens fixed because we can't see I have to keep turning around all this technology we have screens in front of us as well as computers and we're trying to see people you're looking at we can't see unless we turn go ahead thank you alrighty please tell us your name and yeah good evening my name is David paulwickert I was raised in McMinnville went to college in Seattle I've worked in Seattle New York Los Angeles and I love Forest Grove my wife and I have been homeowners in historic old town for over 14 years tonight I would like to draw your attention to Washington County's potential purchase of property near the intersection of Elm Street and Highway 47 for proposed homeless pod location in the eventual building site of an affordable housing complex I'm empathetic to the houselessness crisis and the need for affordable housing but this location is a poor choice due to its lack of nearby Services the proposed location isn't near mass transit shopping or Health Services all things that are vital in the transition away from living on the street and are necessary for the successful transition into permanent housing the Old Town neighborhood in Forest Grove is comprised of large historic homes parks and elementary schools nothing that would Aid in the in the transition from living in a tent to an indoor space that's affordable warm and safe the Elm Street Properties realtor Melvin marks lists another site that would better serve the goal of providing safe affordable housing the location is near the intersection of Maple Street and Pacific Avenue and is currently the location of an auto repair shop called Jim's automotive this alternate location would better serve the Forest Grove Community and the recipients of these Services as it is within walking distance to Affordable shopping restaurants a TriMet bus line and more importantly medical facilities that can care for the needs of this extremely vulnerable population housing is but one limb of a very large tree the roots of that tree are deeply embedded in the addiction treatment physical and mental health services therefore being close to Medical Care will greatly help people transitioning out of homelessness I would like the city of Forest Grove and Washington County to consider the alternate location of Jim's automotive as a potential location when deciding where to build the transition pods and ultimately the affordable housing that is so desperately needed thank you very very much good timing is your name and address please yes my name is Skip Bueller and I live on Elm Street in Forest Grove County Commissioners thank you for letting me speak I want to thank the commissioner Willie for attending our city council meeting last night and for his thoughtful words and suggestions as a concerned citizen I am fully in support of low-income housing and I know that there's a dire need in this community as in most towns of comparable size I commend the Commissioners on looking for ways to address the houselessness crisis and to help those in need of I'm here to express my disbelief in Anger however at the idea of this pod Village being planned at the intersection of Elm Street and Highway 47. Supportive Housing is needed but not at this location whoever decided on this is a suitable location I believe has never been to Forest Grove OR talked to any of the residents living in this section of town there are none of the amenities mentioned as being reasons for picking this spot within a mile of the planned it strikes me as a very Reckless decision and will only exacerbate the tensions between the property owners and the house lists which you should know is already heightened currently there are at least three other locations and Dave mentioned that Jim's automotive that are currently for sale and would actually meet the requirements of the county the counties expressed namely Transportation health clinics Food Services and potential jobs if the model Village is the one that exists in Hillsboro next to Winco Forest Grove is in trouble the proposed site on Elm Street is neighboring two historic districts and numerous historic homes outside of those districts that will be jeopardized by the proposed Village and draw more trash and crime to Elm Street I also want to express my shock and anger when first learning the plan by the county by the lack of transparency and the fact that nearby residents specifically were not clearly informed of this development until very recently it feel I feel like we were purposefully kept in the dark the county has a supposed six-month waiting period from when this plan began in November so that time is almost giving residents little recourse to fight this proposal skip thank you thank you the next two Mr Vice chair is Dane van Kiran and Don Olson olcon my name is Jane van Kiran I live at 22550 Southwest Highland Drive in Sherwood Oregon I want to talk to you about rent price hikes at Cannery Row apartments in I moved to Cannery Row apartments in April of 2018. we have new owners and property managers but things are not going well Sr watt company of California purchased our two in 2019 I contacted representative Courtney neron when there was a rent increase but under different owners and property managers her constituent desk was helpful with the name of an attorney who took the case because of my age in 2023 I contacted niron's office again for help I was grateful to read the Sherwood Gazette about how the city of Sherwood advocated for me neron said that private corporations that raise rent excessively are not invested in community stability she is the chief sponsor of Senate Bill which will require newer buildings to align with a 2019 law I will be speaking in support on March 27th in Salem I circulated a petition among residents to have a meeting with the owners of Cannery Row Cushman Wakefield management and mayor Rosner Rosner said that under state law unfortunately there is no direct action that the city can take other than advocacy he stated when larger corporations backed extensively by Equity money by buildings like mine they may be so out of touch they don't even realize the harm they're doing please respond to my request for help thank you if your name and address for the record I'm Don o'nian my wife and I are residents at 1504 Elm Street in Old Town Forest Grove I'd like to present my concerns about the homeless pod project on Elm Street Elm Street is a very busy and multi-faceted street it's one of three major tie roads between our two major highways Highway 47 and eight which is Pacific Pacific as such it routes very many trucks to and from Central Forest Grove 18-wheelers dump trucks delivery Vans construction vehicles with trailers as well as cars it also is a very direct route for fire trucks police and ambulances to reach Highway 47 in an emergency on top of that there are at least three school bus routes and several special needs buses that are daily along Elm Street also it's a Central Access Road between two large residential neighborhoods Southeast Forest Grove and historic Old Town it has two parks Rogers and a 15th Street baseball diamond Park which is continually used for many purposes other than baseball it is a major route for Walkers cyclers school kids and city bus users the pods would create a homeless foot trout foot traffic Highway day and night through the middle of a family-oriented neighborhoods and activities it would increase police activity with strangers walking through or hiding in the open backyards Alleyways can you wrap it up the Alleyways",

right now I'll just keep moving because I think I can just talk through this and that'll be just fine we have a lot to get through today here is the agenda as you can see as you can't see on the screen uh the first part of today's meeting is going to focus on the eecbg funding opportunity through the iija the way that Congress and the U.S doe structured the program and the requirements for Odo on behalf of the state to submit an application my colleague Emily salmary who is our new federal grants officer will be leading this part of the presentation the second part will be information about the state's approach I will be speaking about the specifics of Oregon's potential program finally finally we'll look for all of your feedback on the state's approach we'll stop and ask questions during the presentation but please know that many of your questions may be answered as we go through the material my colleague Stacy is our host today and will be helping keep an eye out for those questions as well while Tony is still working to get the slides to move forward I'm going to speak a little bit about what the Oregon Department of energy does some of you may be new to an understanding that the state even actually has an Oregon Department of energy I personally do a lot of Outreach and people are oftentimes surprised of the function of the Department of energy and and we would just really like to clear that up so we can assist you there's lots that the Odo we affectionately call it Department of energy can do to help you in your local so before we jump into any further discussion a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of energy or Odo as you might hear us referred to uh on the slide that you'll see here in a little while you'll be able to see our mission statement and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient affordable Energy System a lot a lot is said in that sentence we we advance solutions to shape and Equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and the impacts for a current and future Generations under what we do you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission the funding opportunity we're discussing today will help Odo support a resilient and affordable energy system as we as well as an equitable clean energy no luck yet with the slide deck huh no it's completely Frozen crashed sorry just I'm wondering if maybe Stacy wouldn't be able to uh put it up for us we'll pause for just a moment here folks technical difficulties yep we have it now so Tony if you can advance down to the what is the Oregon Department of energy at slide number four there you go all right everybody oh there we go foreign this is what it was just uh discussing with you the mission and what we do at the Oregon Department of energy you can see on the bottom section there where is Central repository of energy data information and Analysis in fact we uh build a very large report it's called the biennial Energy report every two years we put this report together and it's really it's been really well received by the public if you need a copy of that put that in the chat and we'll make sure you get one but we we do a lot of Regulation and oversight we have several different citing they're responsible for the regulation of new generation facilities within the state there's also a a division that is involved in Hanford and the control of waste products that come out of hand for it kind of protecting the state and most of us on this call are centered around our Energy Efficiency and conservation team so we do a lot of Outreach and in this case uh announcement of funding opportunities next slide Tony I'm hoping you can do it there you go okay so we want to talk about the objectives for date today's webinar I've already briefly talked about some of there's three key objectives for our time together today first we want to make sure that you understand how this eecbg funding works and the parameters that Odo has to work within when designing the states program this is a huge opportunity to bring federal dollars to Oregon to help fund Energy Efficiency strategies in programs across the state second we want to share with you our potential approach for this funding and what we're considering putting in our application to the usdoe we do want to hear from you on the program design and application and get your ideas for how to improve it today remember the draft proposal we're sharing with you today is just that a draft we want input and feedback to better to make it better to align with the work already being done and or planned by small cities and counties and to better meet the objectives outlining the federal funding opportunity as I mentioned earlier we will have time for verbal public comment at the end and we'll also hope and we also hope that people will submit written comments through our online portal if you don't want to speak right now uh or if you have more to say next slide Tony and now I'd like to introduce to you Emily salmary she's our uh our official uh person from that'll be is brand new to the organization doing a fantastic job she's a grants officer working with one other person and it's amazing to me that this person can get as much done as she does she'll be able to share more information on the federal bill that created this take it away Emily if you're ready thanks Roger that was way too kind and generous but um hi everybody I am Emily salmary as Roger said I Am brand new to Odell um about two months ago and um working on a couple of Grants here of course one of them being eecbg which we're talking about today I want to start out by giving you just a little bit of background on where this funding came from which as some of you may know is the infrastructure investment in jobs um this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars for the U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations additionally this program like other Federal Energy programs is covered by the justice 40 initiative this Federal initiative directs that 40 of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged all right next slide please we should be on slide seven there we go perfect oh thanks Tony all right so um just a little bit about our guiding principles here after the passage of both the

        "text": "and welcome to the April 4th 2024 Washington County Board of Commissioners Roundtable we have a very full day today but the first part of our day will uh be a special uh emergency response tabletop exercise and thank you John Wheeler uh for putting this together for us this is part of a series of information and uh other sessions that the board has asked for and been through uh to uh improve our knowledge and learning more about the organization's preparedness for different uh major emergencies we've been through a lot over these last four or five years and uh we and the organization have have um learned learned over the course of time and made improvements but this is an opportunity for us as a board to really help cement that for ourselves so that it's more rot uh the next time something un occurs so at this juncture we'll turn it over to you great thank you very much chair Harrington and and thank you very much for this opportunity chair and and board members uh for the record I'm John Wheeler uh manager of Washington County Emergency Management um and uh getting into our order of Ceremonies today as chair Harrington just mentioned uh what we are doing today is what I would call Capstone uh on a year plus effort to um uh help improve the board's awareness knowledge uh skills and abilities uh for uh responding to recovering from preparing for responding to and recovering from uh large scale emergencies and disasters um and uh so the aspects of that process that we've been through that that path that we've been been down over the past year or so is up on the uh screen here we we have been working to uh improve the board's General preparedness through providing uh binders contact information the elected officials Emergency Operations guide there's still some uh work in progress in regard to that uh we did a initial work session on February 28th last year uh providing a general overview and orientation to Emergency Management in Washington County talking about the emergency management system in Washington County the state and in the region uh we did an orientation to uh board Emergency Operations in May and I would call that uh orientation uh the uh dactic version of what we're going to talk about today uh which is the board's role uh in emergencies uh and then uh in September we did a uh Adrian Doner and I did a session for the board work session to talk about uh how we do uh orientation our reg and education to the community to help improve Community preparedness and resilience so again that brings us today where we're going to do a a exercise uh so General agenda today is I'll give an exercise overview we'll talk about what these exercises are all about how they fit into our this plan uh we'll get right into it I will present Cas scenario we will use our imaginations uh and uh we will have three different modules to this exercise uh first one we'll deal with the instant onset about the first 24 48 Hours uh of a substantial emergency uh module two is going to be more internally focused where we're going to talk about and focus on employee health and safety and continuity of operations that is going to be a progression of the scenario so we'll still have an opportunity to talk uh where we're at with the instant and how the instant response and Community response activities are taking place uh and then module three uh is uh going to focus on community support and preparing for Recovery uh something we didn't focus on a whole lot in the May uh presentation uh but that that I'd like to spend a little time on today uh in in our walkthrough today uh and then we'll do a wrap up there if I could add uh I asked Diane tenuchi Dennis our CEO to make sure that clean water services was here since we also serve as the board of directors for uh that Premiere utility and we know that all of these incidents that the county goes through the utility also goes through so um if we make note of anything that would help us with regard to that utility uh Jack will will capture that for us or if we have any questions great thank you Jack yeah yeah EXC um so the EXT quick overview of the exercise our our purpose today is to validate the board's understanding of of your roles and responsibilities in a disaster and identify any remaining uh knowledge gaps or other issues uh that we identify today uh the scope of this is of course this is not going to be real time uh activity uh this is really I would call it a walk through um it's a chance for us to sort of play cards with our hands face up uh so to speak uh what we had with the uh when we talked about this in May in May was more of a dactic and and academic discussion of the board's role in Emergency Operations uh this is our opportunity to do something that still is um notional but is going to be focused on uh how we would react to a fairly specific scenario uh that offens up today uh the focus is on clarification of roles responsibilities uh and expectations uh we don't have too much of an opportunity in this environment to get down to Super tactical uh details but that's that's consistently you fors rols in those situations and this is really meant to be a low stress and collaborative uh working environment today uh yeah we're all on this yeah not a t team team for yeah we we're not going to put anybody on the spot we we'll work together uh here today and we have some expertise in the room uh to help us answer any questions that may arise so John um you've been our emergency management manager here in Washington County for five six years at least yeah five years 2019 okay um in my prior elected capacity as a Metro counselor I was one of the founding members MERS of the regional disaster preparedness organization and I can't remember at at what time uh but we had uh as part of that a couple of different uh guest speakers at different meetings and one of them was the uh County chair County Commissioner in Napa County California um where we had invited her to come up and speak to us about their most recent earthquake um experience well it just so happened it was after the wildfire that they experienced now I believe you were with Vancouver or was it Clark County yeah Clark County a were you part of that the whole rdpo work groups um did you did you attend that meeting by any chance uh that's a good question I uh I'll be honest I did not attend all the policy committee meetings okay not of put in there I do have a rough inkling I know there was a lot of discussion and some sharing that Napa California jurisic well I learned a lot uh we had dinner together um uh a few of us uh at the at the time rdpo chair Tony Hyde uh uh in um Vernonia and Columbia County um he was a and still is a well as an elected official he was one of the most experienced natural disaster Commissioners um and so I joined him uh as well as the rdpo management uh in having dinner with with this commissioner and then the the meeting the next day and the Forum learned a lot about uh how involved the things that the commission had to do in order to support the organization in each of those events and some of the uniquenesses that came up so um I may have some questions later on about what about and some of them I have have shared with Miss Angie wondering as we've gone through different things you know how do we make sure essentially employees are taken care of I ask a quick question is the rdpo rep now has there been that type of presentation in the last few years and the reason I'm asking you I'd like to I'd like to give you request that so if you could just we don't have to answer it this meeting's not about rdpo but yeah if we can just talk about that John I'd appreciate it yeah the rdpo has had over the years years uh different presenters workshops happen where we've learned from other communities bad disaster experiences but that's good feedback I can take that back to Mar 30 there and I know that commissioner scouton was the member then but I don't know how he brought that information back to the Board of um similarly in our formation uh with with him our first couple of years being that rep we didn't much thank you uh we are going to use a uh a wildfire scenario today um wildfires are are course a growing concern now increasingly on the west side of the Cascades U and so also we have Wildfire season coming up here uh in a little while so it's time that regard and Wildfire scenarios also prent present really a good scenario uh to demonstrate the capabilities that we have in the county uh they're fast acting so they work really well for a tabletop type of like this um so that's the plan uh just a quick overview I did want to sort of touch on some highlights I know uh that we've shared with you all an update draft of the elected officials Emergency Operations guide um work on that actually uh that turned into somewhat of a project and then we did a couple of of substantial updates to that to uh make it easier to read and and refer to and we also had some added some Public Health authorities uh to it um I thought that was after or before this it's a it's it's after uh the previous Edition so there's just a March uh there's a March Edition okay yeah and I have well it needs to be printed without the Rev marks wasted okay um so uh and that will be that that that those a a good valuable reference document for these discussions here today um in terms of overviewing the County uh the board's emergency response role and how the county would respond to an incident of course when we respond to an incident uh we are basically applying the County's Emergency Operations plan and we are also applying What's called the national Incident Management System the national Incident Management System basically provides the standards uh of Incident Management um Resource Management incident organization and that kind of thing that that we and all of our partners uh really must use in order to have an interoperable and integrated response to an incident our Emergency Operations plan then Iden ifies how we're going to carry out certain functions uh specifically in the county How We Do Mass care shelter transportation pation that kind of thing so when we uh when we respond to an incident those are sort of our two uh guide marks our Emergency Operations plan and then",

        "text": " are interlinked and I think there's no debate we've heard from the community that we can't move away and it doesn't sound like that's what we I'm very confused of the direction we're taking from a public health professional I have concerns about what is uh we're not going to be doing focusing on this part but I trust your leadership Marie and and and your judgment and as our local Health Public Authority officer official I trust your judgment in coming to the board to give us um information that so for us to make that sound decision with that um I am a bit concerned about the direction we're going and in terms of I hear I don't know the framing the titling was climate adaptation and I think we're sending a message to our community that we're moving away from climate mitigations so I think we need to be a bit more that's not what that's not what I either we never were doing climate mitigation we've had no actions I hear you I'm gonna finish my comment uh and say that the community we need to be strong in how we message because I don't think um considering what the chair said that's not the understanding that is within our community we have been doing climate mitigations we have been helping our community address you know greenhouse gas emissions and we have been doing you know some kind of a climate mitigation climate change mitigations but now this conversation around adaptation people are asking the question how are you going to adapt to an a dying environment what are you going to do are you going to move every residence of Washington County to a new Resident new area and where is that new area right so I think those are the questions and the comments that I hear from the community and if we don't listen to our community then are we not their leaders right so we have to listen to our community so we have to come back with a strong you know message around and I'm really hoping the inventory and this timeline the aggressive timeline that you laid out and very detailed uh I think um when you come back I think it will be really critical of that decision of where do we go how do we help yes we need to mitigate continue and yes we need to do adaptation to really help the community adapt to this environment while but we can't just say we're never going to mitigate you know so and if we have not been doing mitigations then more the reason to do it now right to drop everything to say forget about adaptations we need to mitigate now so to your point chair Harrington if we've never been mitigating climate change now is the Okay so commissioner Rogers you've been here for 38 39 years has has the county had a climate action plan depends on how you has it adopted a climate action plan well sort of sort of in pieces nothing like comprehensive right yeah so to say we've been doing mitigation we've had an office of sustainability focused on our operations so we haven't been doing mitigation with so that's where I disagree with your the picture you've painted so if I could just change distractions this information I I was just uh I am where Mr Teresa was the more information we get the smarter we are and this is stuff that um that I know very surface level so I really appreciate all the work that you're doing to do this and these studies that we've got coming over the next 18 months and I think what bothered me most is that 18 months is 20 25 and I always think 2025 is like way out there so let's let's not bring that into 18 months here but uh but the studies that you're doing are going to continually educate us and to me we can say it's a it's a big world issue and what's our little Washington County going to do about it or we can say what small little bites can we take off this um to make things better and maybe encourage others to take the same lead so I'm certainly supportive and appreciate the work that you've done especially you Rob and I know that are you taking Peter's spot over there he was a great guy over there he got some good things done so high expectations on your part but uh but anyway just again I I appreciate your educating me on this and we'll see where we can go with this information so thank you so my question starts to the board could you bring up the prior slide please so board help me understand where does the board fit in there and what do you need to be on this because if the expectation is that there is some plan adopted by this board I don't see it and I don't see a journey to get there but I thought colleagues I would ask you what do you see that I don't see yet I'll go I think I don't see the board makes a commitment to this problem and I don't see Where is the sort of the community phasing group that we talked about in some of the auctions where did that come in so one the commitment is missing for me but I was willing to go along this journey to see what comes out of this timelines to make that decision but I I think we don't actually even have a commitment to do this work as a board level what is the board's commitment to this issue and and how do we establish and then I think goes back to that resolution um commission trees and I brought to establish that commitment but so go ahead now go ahead so um I think this has some ingredients but I think that uh there needs to be some additional uh planning done here otherwise all you have is a department plan and you won't have a board that's going to put any Financial commitment behind it or any policy commitment behind it because they're not on the journey right I think and you did uh mention a couple of good things with regard to community engagement that was highlighted uh Public Health advisory committee and um and I was just pointing out this morning that one piece of infrastructure acre is our newest board and commission that was started and it took about five meetings before packets were finally published and available uh we were just catching up this morning on summary I appreciate hearing that those two committees that are already in place you'll leverage I think that's that's really good uh but we've also heard excuse me excuse me uh members of our community who proposed that we just Empower them give them the quote unquote uh task and leave it to them to come back and tell us what we need to do as a County government which is not a reasonable approach as well because we don't we have limited resources so I think I think this timeline has good ingredients but I also think that I'd like to see a clear definition of what distinguishes phase one from phase two from phase three if you know that yet or it could be like some programs that I've dealt with before there's the universe of possibilities and then so phase you you have the the ghg inventory right so a large pool of options and so then your phases one two and three and four um a narrowing right but I don't know that because I've only I only have this information to go on so that's why I have these questions and I'm looking for a further um uh so sure we can follow up with that uh information including um what are the clear board touch points um illustrate just um the involvement of the public health advisory what does that mean and what scope acre what does that mean and what scope um engagement windows so on this timeline it refers to phase one two three and four typically in community engagement you can sometimes better Define what phase one is and then as you kind of narrow that funnel it becomes clear as you go through the timeline but we can take kind of more this into a further project plan this is just a really high level uh presentation so a high level timeline so if there's other aspects that you're not seeing on here we'd be happy to provide that and follow-up yep so like I said good also related is we've had our first conversation about climate and what might we do in 2019 and based upon what was on our plate we said you know we just don't have the bandwidth to invest time into this topic because of what we already had on our plate in 2019 so we put it on our list of things to come back to and then we went on one incredible wild ride with which led to our July 2021 I think it was July 2021 where uh we asked our two staffs to report on on efforts and then went through further conversation and I want to compliment you commissioner Rogers you're being very consistent uh I've I've heard you make some of the same comments in each of these conversations maybe that's all I know no because one of the reasons why I was recommending we get started with more of the adaptation is because locally people can really relate to that what I mean by the that I mean the effects that we're already living with today it's no longer out there in the right the heat Dome that we went through was that June of 2021 thank you uh the the wacky extreme weather incident luckily we haven't had the floods and the hurricanes and the tornadoes but you can't air traffic travel is no longer a smooth ride all the time right you have to expect it's going to be bumpy or worse um so these are very real effects that I think we can use to Galvanize more of our community members around this topic than ever before you know okay so someone came and commented today and people are going to want to hear what they want to hear so you know they'll keep commenting fine uh but we do have limited resources of time energy dollars and political capital and we've got to be proud and I'm also going to be pragmatic about what the state expects us to do as well because they didn't follow through on their 2005 goals their uh legislative uh requirements that had all of us at the city county and Metro level make commitments on land use and transportation they've left us high and and that's where I'm not interested in a community topic where we're going to be solving the world when we're living in the world of measure 547 and 50 property tax constraints so on and so forth and we're looking at having to decrease our social services as presented today with developmental disability with Aging Services with veteran services with mental health services with substance abuse Services you keep going down the line Public Safety Patrol jail Community Corrections Juvenile Justice um but darn will have a great looking climate action plan it just can't do",

you and then just going back to Ashley Ashley do you want to unmute if you can okay well thank you everyone and thank you for joining us because your input is vital to our overall process before we get started I just want to make sure we're going to be sharing a lot of information today and we're going to be seeking your input on a lot of our mitigation strategies understanding our threats um so if you can if you haven't already done so can you scan the QR code or join link because we're going to use a tool called slido to get your comments so that we can uh get your input document and our folks here can do what they do with all the data that they collect so um thank you everyone I'm going to go ahead and oh did you sorry there's three of them here did you get that and there are QR codes on the table as flow and those online I think you guys got the QR code and and the link so we have a plethora of QR codes so some of these are for a different plan um yes we are very into QR codes right now but make sure you get the right QR code yeah which one all right and I'll also just can I yes so so the QR code to slido this is the platform that we'll be using for you guys to give us feedback I will say it's a little bit cumbersome some of the questions on a smart device so if you have a laptop that would be preferable we also have hard copies in the room and pens so if you find it cumbersome on your phone you're welcome to also do it just old school and actually write down okay I'm going to go ahead and get started um first of all we have a lot of uh things to cover today we're going to go over um our project timeline with you and the structure some of our methods Casey will be sharing that with us um and then we're g to go over some preliminary results from our Energy Systems risk assessment and then talk about who has been engaging us you know where they come from around the state as well as talk about those risk analysis results we've come up with a suite of mitigation strategies that we definitely want you to weigh in on and then we'll talk about next steps and what happens after this entire Road show that we've going but before we get started I just want to talk a little bit about what the Oregon energy department does we do a lot of things we have a small team of about20 that's a small agency compared to some but we do establish the energy goals and policies for the state we are the central repository for all Energy Information data and Analysis we uh provide education and Outreach on energy issues we do Grant Administration as well as regulating oversee some of the sighting of the energy facilities in the state now our division is the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness division we focus on the protection of the public and environment and some of you may know but we do the Oregon fuel action plan we developed and maintain it so it's our responsibility that even in a worst case disaster we have strategies in place to ensure that we have adequate fuel supplies to support the state's response and Recovery efforts in addition to our fuel resilience work we also maintain the Statewide contingency plan for radiological emergencies at fixed facilities um with potential impacts to the state of Oregon and then we take the lead on ensuring that all radioactive materials that are transported on Oregon highways are done safely so um that's part of what we do but we also then lead the development of the energy security plan so what are we going to do today since we kicked off our stakeholder engagement with all of you a lot of work has been done since last fall so we're going to give you a project progress update we're also going to of course share about the energy systems U risk assessment that was completed and some of those results and then again those mitigation strategies um that you we want to hear from you about what you think in this region what makes sense in reducing risks a little bit more about our project team um CNA you met Casey and Andrew they're also partnering with Haley and Aldridge to do some of the technical analysis work they've done a lot of work in the CI Hub that you guys have all heard about we also are working very closely with the Oregon Public Utility Commission really leveraging their expertise and experience with the electric electricity and natural gas sector so they're a part of our team and then of course you all because all emergencies start at the local level and um you guys have unique understanding and the experience of the energy and security um in this region and we'd really like your input um and knowledge on what works what you think will and won't um as far as reducing risks so the energy security plan is Guided by both state and federal um the federal infrastructure and investment jobs act as well as Senate 1567 directs that our agency develop an energy security plan that assesses all threats and Hazards to the energy systems in Oregon that's all natural disasters as well as Manning disasters like physical attacks or cyber security attacks on the energy systems we're also having to provide an energy profile that dis describes Oregon's um energy demands and consumption as well as describe the electricity natural gas and liquid fuel systems from production all the way to end use we have to talk about our Energy emergency response plans and strategies to uh manage and address Supply disruptions as well as uh speak on multi-state Regional coordination because energy emergencies in our state can very well impact the supplies in other states and you know energy emergencies don't stop at the state mind so um then Senate Bill 1567 also adds an additional fuel component that is above what the federal requirements are and I'll talk more about Senate Bill 1567 later on in the presentation so what is the goal of energy security we align our goal with the federal goal and that's to ensure that we have a reliable and resilient supply of energy through efforts to identify assess and mitigate risks to the energy system so that we're better prepared to respond and recover from Supply disruptions but Odo added four keywords at an affordable price because equity and the ability to afford energy is very important to us because if we don't have that we're creat creating our own energy and security so that's going to be a part of our plan as well so what's our strategy there are so many organizations and agencies that have done great work studies reports on energy issues so our strategy is to combine all the current relevant information on energy with our new analysis that we're doing on risks and threats to the energy systems we're combining that so ultimately our goal is to create a suite of mitigation strategies that we can invest in in the future to improve our overall resilience and energy Security in Oregon over time and one of those strategies comes from Senate Bill 1567 legislators directed our agency to assess the viability of increasing fuel storage around the state so that we're less vulnerable to a Cascadian event we all know that um in a 9.0 caspia earthquake our Region's fuel infrastructure will be devastated and it will take um weeks if not months to get fuel supply into Oregon to the impacted communities but because of widespread damage to the transportation systems it's going to be very difficult to get fuel to those Western State uh communities in the west of the I5 for so the idea here is to increase fuel storage in strategic locations that may likely be um survive at at an earthquake you know we're going to factor in those 31 Islands that's Department of Human Services has been studying and see if we can find strategic locations just to increase a little bit of fuel so that we would have a little bit more on hand should we have this disaster and this is just to be clear we're not talking about replacing the ciub fuel terminals this is just to make communities uh less vulnerable and less reliant on the CI Hub while we're trying to bring an outside fuel resource into the state and we would be focusing mostly on public facilities like um you know OD do maintenance yards gas motor pools Public Work yards local airports those kinds of facilities so a lot of data has been collected we've been doing surveys interviews meetings with all of you local state agencies federal agencies as well as um environmental justice organizations and our private sector Partners so a lot of data please you know feel free to visit our website to track our progress or you can scan the QR code here is this the same a different QR code but to track our progress and um yeah so right now we are um doing our road show uh last Tuesday we were in tillou Wednesday in",

        "text": " you know inclusive of the f-sec process but not you know ex not just the fsi process so i think that'll be helpful for council and staff to get a broader understanding of what it takes to you know create and ultimately operate these facilities but i wanted to first provide a little context of fsec jurisdictional renewable energy projects so i'm going to share my screen really quickly all right and is that coming up not coming up yet i'm not sure why is nobody able to see my screen yet see your screen but it's not showing content there it is there goes yep that's working now so you can see the staff report the table needs to be enlarged some it looks like it needs to finish loading sorry i should have practices i'm not actually used to doing the sharing i don't know why this is not sharing i'm gonna stop try it again okay so i don't know why it's not working nancy can you bring up the staff report for agenda item g that way let's continue wasting time move control back over to nancy can you see are you working on that thank you can you increase the size of that please that helps yeah a little bit more a little bit more oops gonna lose the page nope it must be uh slow on my end so is that can everybody see that or does it need to be reduced now it needs to be reduced or moved up one or the other um yeah i mean we'll scroll down because then i'll be able to show kind of more of it so yeah so sorry for the delay on that um first of all i wanted to indicate that i was probably in a hurry to get the staff report out so uh using the template it includes attachment one draft proposed order and attachment two comments there are no attachments so that was my error leaving that in so i apologize if that resulted in any confusion by anybody can you scroll down to show the first table they're perfect right there so the staff report includes two tables the first table is just a roll-up of all the energy renewable energy projects oh sorry yeah right there so far so you can see that the number of projects in operation in construction the ones that were approved have been approved and are still valid but have not been constructed and then projects that are terminated or the one thing i didn't include here is any projects that are currently under review just to let you know we have six projects currently under review uh for a total of one uh 1895 megawatts or just about two gigawatts so there's a substantial amount of power represented in these projects getting down to table number two i'm not going to get into any details associated with any of the individual projects but you can kind of see you know what i what i did here is i created a timeline basically the timeline reflects the kind of conclusion of the council's review in whatever way that happened and the color coding kind of relates to the status of projects so the most recent obsidian that was approved is on top and then the oldest is on bottom so nancy can you scroll to the bottom please and there is a key to the color coding um at the bottom i won't go over that right now but i'll yeah if you can just scroll up just a little bit nancy perfect right there yeah what a little bit more up sorry there's probably a delay um so you can see you know we had the first two renewable energy projects that were given site certificates and terminated but those are fairly old ones i'm going to start with the the ones that are in the green highlight and show what this pattern kind of shows the green reflects the projects that were approved that went into under their original approval and so you can see at least based upon what this pattern at least reflects to me is that there was a market for wind energy projects you know between 2000 2001 and about 2010 because every project that was you know approved in that time frame went into construction you know within that original approval so you can scroll up about half a page nancy yeah and so then getting into um the late 2000s the market started to change and so these colors kind of reflect that change you have the green the dark green or the darker green ones are projects that were approved wind projects that were approved but received multiple time extensions did not go into construction within the original time frames and then you know another example of that is even the golden hills project which fairly recently went into construction is only constructing about half of what was originally approved so you know there is effectively another half of that project that could be along those timelines you can see the other color patterns the dark gray or projects that didn't conclude the f-sec process for whatever reason they withdrew so there were you know a fair number of wind projects that started the process and ultimately withdrew you have the helix wind project and then if you scroll up a little bit nancy and then the saddle butte also kind of within that time frame projects that ultimately did receive a site certificate but but elected for whatever reason um to not build and terminated their site certificates so and then you know wheat ridges is one that was a little different that actually went into construction within the time frames scroll up a little bit more right there and so now we get into the solar so you have the boardman facility and the cardi facility those were the two first two solar projects approved by both of those one has already received a time extension for beginning construction and the other is under review right now for extending the beginning construction time frame so we're already seeing a different pattern with solar than we saw with wind because at least for the boardman project they indicated they didn't have a power purchase agreement so there was no market for for that project whereas if you scroll up a little bit we have the bake oven project and it's been split into a couple um that went into construction relatively soon after approval similarly the montag solar which was an amendment to an existing wind project you know that went into construction relatively soon after it was approved as well and then we have these other projects in blue that have received approval they're still under their original approval and haven't begun construction but they're still under the original time frame so we're already starting to see a different pattern with solar projects than we we saw with wind so i just wanted to give council a little bit of context of what we've seen you know with f-sect jurisdictional projects so that when max and diane are doing their presentation you can kind of think about about that within the broader kind of framework that they're going to provide so unless you have any questions for me i took way longer than i expected so my apologies to max and diane on that and i will turn it over to all right thanks todd so max diane the floor is yours welcome and thank you for joining us great thank you it's great to be here um and i will admit uh equal and experience maybe that todd expressed in sharing on webex platform but i would be happy to give it a go if i could get some get the for sharing my screen maybe while i'm working on that i'll um my name is diane brandt and i'm the organ policy manager with renewable northwest and um my colleague max green will start start us out and i will be working on figuring out shared screen in the meantime thanks diane thank you todd for that really helpful context um i i was intrigued to see your your when you first developed and shared them with us and appreciate you're kind of walking through them today and thank you of course to chair grail and the council for welcoming us here today to share some additional context essentially what needs to happen in addition to an f-sec site certificate in order for an f-sect jurisdictional project to actually come to fruition and and at the same time identify some of the factors that might cause even a project that holds the site certificate not to advance and to uh first though i'm going to start with just a brief introduction to our organization renewable northwest so you know a little bit more about who we are as an organization and after that i'm going to pass the baton to diane to kick off the the substantive portion of our presentation so at renewable northwest our mission is to decarbonize the region by accelerating the transition to renewable energy we are a 501c3 advocacy organization uh not a trade association though we are a member-driven organization so we count in our membership a number of renewable energy developers related businesses including environmental consultants law firms the folks that you all see on a regular in considering site certificates as well as buyers of renewable energy and then we also have a number of environmental nonprofits nrdc is a member climate solutions and consumer advocates so the oregon citizens utility board is an active member as well so we really see a lot of strength in our diverse membership appreciate being a 501c3 that you know we talk to our members we try to get really high quality information and come to decisions on our own independently about what the best way forward is in order to achieve that decarbonization mission and as for geography we are a regional organization diane and i are both based here in oregon i'm just outside portland in tigard our office is in portland and diane is in corvallis we have staff in washington and montana and we engage in policy and regulatory work in all four states and speaking of that policy and regulatory work uh regulatory work is really our bread and butter um we do a lot of engagement at state utility commissions um probably the oregon commission most of all but also the the washington utc the idaho puc the montana psc and a lot of that tends to focus on the sort of central regulatory process for electric utilities of doing integrated resource planning where the utilities assess their their needs and come up with plans for how to meet those needs on a lease cost least risk basis then flowing through to rfps where they actually go out and try to get the resources to meet the needs and finally looking for rate recovery for those investments after they've gone through the rfp process um at our organization tend to engage less with the rate processes but the irps and the rfps are a big part of what we do we also do engage",

        "text": "r's um territory they would also be signatories that's in addition to the requirement that the community service fee agreement or the the agreement has to have 75 percent of the local taxing districts um consent essentially um and then the final piece that was included in this because Sip and gain share go hand in hand there was an extension of the game share program out to 2030 but there was no increase in the cap I should note that these legislative changes for sip agreements go into effect of what's called The 91st day after session which is September 25th of 2023 so if we were to reach an agreement with an entity before that it would be under old terms if we reach an agreement after that it's under the new terms so as um September 25th 2023 is the 91st and except Democrats yes so two more months um so those were the legislative updates and the conversations um were were challenging I will say the game share uh cap we faced a significant shrinkage of it as a possibilities so this can say a win for us and from there I'll turn it back to Matt great thank you so now uh turning to the Washington County's sip policy so Washington County has an sip policy that was last Revisited in 2006. uh the policy was designed to direct staff during sip oops I'm going to go back to this one uh so the Sip policy and this was contained attached to the memo that we sent with the the packet for today's presentation uh there's four sections in the in the policy there's a program overview which is a high level summary of the Sip program program objectives these are nine board priorities from the 2006 board on how the county should use the Sip tool there's evaluation guidelines which are a series of questions that County staff should use to evaluate acip deal there's a review process which describes the sap process from the County's perspective for today's discussion I suggest that we focus on the Sip program objectives these objectives were developed by a different board over 15 years ago given that much time has passed and we have a new board we would like to start the conversation today about whether your board would like to affirm modify or change these objectives please note that this is the start of this conversation as stated in one of the policy questions that we mentioned earlier today should your board be interested in seeing and update to these objectives or other parts of the County's policy staff can return with a proposed options at a later date to summarize the program objectives and remember there are there are nine of them here uh they really boil down to about six things they focus in on job creation and supporting the local Workforce economic growth General increase in taxable value of properties alignment of County goals for service provision and Community design objectives Mitigation Of impacts on services and reasonableness of sip deals and accountability for participating in I have this slide in here with them in their entirety and not going to run through these we'll keep keep this slide in the slide deck here just in case uh your board would like to reference them during the discussion um as as we have participated and listened into your board conversations a few things have stuck out to us about ideas that might help support a modification of the policy objectives these are things like supporting marginalized communities as fundamental to promoting Equitable and Equitable economy that provides opportunity for uh government transparency is crucial for providing Community with information about decision making and Investments and a good good government practices and also urban service provision is the job of City governments I want to be careful about the County's uh role in providing those Services those are a few things that we've gave word here and so uh we're going to land here on again these policy questions uh for you all which again I'll just read one more time what are the objectives that the board would like to prioritize in a future sip agreements does your board support County staff moving forwards uh with updating the county sip policy document for board consideration and what further information does your board need to guide sip policy that's the end of our presentation sure Harrington I'll turn it back to you so colleagues a big topic um first before we get to these policy questions are there any questions with regard to clarification for what the state legislature has completed and I don't know if the governor has signed all the legislation that relates to both game share and the Sip I'm double checking that now nope they don't but I do I re I came into this um after having read the the whole packet and documentation but your presentation has helped me internalize that the state legislature the the nature of the changes to sip in um changing the minimum payment I knew it had increased to 150 but I wasn't clear that that also include the indexing from there I thought it was going to be one or the other so thank you um it's a composite right that's under two it's both yeah indexing yeah yeah and at for the existing 100 million dollar ones or is it for new yeah for the existing 100 million dollar cap levels they are now indexed the indexing is set to begin in 2024 essentially yeah yeah so um yeah yeah yeah um then I had not internalized the community service fee cap increasing to 300 million and also that that would be indexed so thank you for making sure that I heard that really appreciate it with our current sips what is were any of the local taxing districts are then the folks that get the part of that game share distribution were they not required to sign on before the cities were the cities were but not metro metro or any of the other impacted local districts they just had to show no we only had to show that 75 of the taxable value agreed with the contract which when you combined a city and a county usually you hit that 75 threshold now it's 75 so now it's District it's an addition so it's the city still has to sign on if it's within its jurisdictional boundaries as well as the port and the Special Districts as outlined in the law so it just adds the number of signatures needed on the document to show business Oregon okay okay great thank you I'm clear on that um so one reason why before we get into all these policy questions I thought I would also make sure I got the details right but also touched on comments on this is if I heard you correctly big caveat um it there was mentioned that the the Sip and gain share programs with for the chips act would be part or would satisfy that local collaboration that one sort of rubs me a little bit wrong and the reason for that is that the state legislature has significantly over the last few increased negative impact to counties through unfunded mandates and it's really huge if we are to swallow that pill that Sip and gain share satisfy the local collaboration to chips then I would urge our community members who are going to be angry at us in the future about potential cuts and services layoffs or furloughs thank your local state the lack of the Gap increase for gain share really hurts us given the year over year significant added impact that state legislation action has on the services that they require us to do here in Washington County yes I'm on my soapbox but that's why earlier this year when we were talking about the chips act in work session I said emphatically I would not support a an additional sip at the current terms these new terms are a step forward necessary but not sufficient is a phrase that comes to my mind so I'm going to be very interested in exploring these other additional fees I need to learn more about that because the impact is very real I am feeling like our State Legislative Partners have forgotten that County governments are an instrument of the state for delivering a lot of services shared services and required Services I have already accepted the assignment to learn more in this domain so that I am better equipped for making informed decisions for our next proposed budget and future proposed budgets so that's my peace of mind check done I just want to emphasize that there's also a requirement in the chips and Sciences act that the state steps in as well in the state has set aside general fund revenues to provide their portion of the support and buy-in that is matched by our sip so it's we are not the only card that needs to be in the deck for any business that comes forward ours just comes in this form of investment um and that there is a recognition that without incentives that at all levels so not just local and federal that the state has to be there as well and and the state finally puts the money up it's not enough it won't cover the cost to provide the services but that's where our negotiated agreements and the objectives and that the board can set as part of the Sip negotiations will guide us I'm particularly concerned about the land use requirements that cities will be following up on but I know that there's a relationship with County for land use and transportation capacity planning and then capacity delivery and then of course uh folks tend to think about what level of drinking water quality new firms require but they often forget about the backside of that and that's the waste water which as the board of Clean Water Services we're very familiar with and the carrying costs for that are going to be extensive and making sure that these firms are covering that and not just the rate payer so anyway learning a lot got a lot more to learn so that we can use these Economic Development tools effectively so that's all um I just have more to try and so these policy questions and these objectives so there's what you heard and now this slide so how do we marry up the fact that through your conversations with us one-on-one you've heard could we go back Wednesday we've you've heard these things so how do you see us incorporating these themes into either the current policy objectives or the need for new Standalone policy objectives uh it's a great question I think uh the staff can take a look at the nine policy objectives that we have and propose some modification or changes to uh to strengthen or to modify them to align with some of these things that we've heard or other priorities that the board has so I think uh you know one place that we might start uh that you all might start is as we think about um supporting economic Mobility the powerful slide that uh that Chris uh showed that shows that uh folks uh every Everybody benefits that there is a job uh",

        "text": " easement it's it's it's a it's a public easement it's it's it's benefiting the department of energy and it's it's kind of serving a bigger purpose than just uh private private property so I think um there is a question about whether that is applicable there and what that says in that 055 is that um in the case of Federal Regulations federal regulations Trump local regulations nonetheless um as your staff pointed out the the section on private e must just say that um the city's development code generally applies in the case of private easement so as staff pointed out the city's code also has a process to provide flexibility to the city's rules in certain cases and in this case we are requesting an adjustment and there's and that's the process we're following and the purpose for adjustments um is just is just this very situation where we have a unique development situation um in this case that does not allow treace right and we're requesting an adjustment and in exchange for that adjustment um we've offered some some other concessions I just want to show I I think regarding the screening that we are going to be providing between the two subject properties I think this slide does an okay job of showing it and so does this one all these little green dots here um it's it's not even showing all the trees it's really just most of the trees in proximity to the appellant's property you can see you know there while there aren't trees along the property line there are circles here this is what we submitted to BPA ignore those those were denied but there's a lot of there's a lot of trees between the appellant property and our building and those will screen the building partially right so in addition to that fence and the Landscaping it's not just it's not just going to be a clear view of the building it will be broken up by a lot of trees and you can see here that's kind of the theme throughout the site right like I mentioned we're going to be planting planting approximately 450 trees and a lot of shrubs can you be more specific with where the trees are going to be yeah so if you can see on this image here just I just highlighted a few of these trees in proximity to um the South property line so those green this mouse is kind of right I'm just trying to I'm just trying to square what you said with this picture because you said it was going to screen the building but I don't see any trees between this particular property and that building so this is this is the building in question right here this building 33 and I'm sorry this mouse keeps running down but here's building 33 yes and we've got some trees here these are these will be kind of columnar type of trees that'll grow to 20 20 plus feet tall right so those two will screen screen the building we've got a tree here and then um I those that's the majority of the the trees that will be screening the building but there are trees the point is there are trees between our building and the property um there was there was a comment about um about vehicle lights from the parking lot um the appellant has agreed that those those concerns are addressed with the the placement of the um I I guess the one last point and and I I appreciate this comment um you know our I guess the the the appellant stated that uh their goal in trying to settle this um in in our client paying for the their attorney fees um you know our I guess just the point I want to make is our our client also had to spend considerable amount of funds in in having us prepare for the hearing tonight and be here so I think that's you know we we expect that's part part of this part of this process and that's that's the way these decisions go but um at the end of the day we feel confident that we've provided an application that um meets the intent of the code and we've worked hard to be a good neighbor and provide the the the mitigation the concessions that we can um I guess uh in recognition of of the development constraints on the site thank you thank you councelor Stapleton uh yes I was wondering did you have any other concerns from any of the other neighbors was there any other we we didn't NOP okay thank you other questions for the applicant all right thank you you that's it right I'm going to close the public hearing and uh we can still ask questions of Staff if we have them uh do we have questions for staff all right um councelor Gonzalez are you prepared with the motion I move we uh affirm the planning administrator's decision can I can I ask a point of clarification does that include the requested modification to include the fence I assumed it did yeah I assume it too so to clarify it's the staff recommendation with the addition of including the fence as a discussion well I will just say that uh just based on the testimony I heard it sounded like uh the parties reached uh in essence in agreement uh in terms of the impact on the neighbor the neighbor seemed to be satisfied with it short of the financial consideration which I understand that that concern but my primary concern was about the livability and it seems like that was a a compromise has been reached that will address that so I'm satisfied that the staff recommendation with the modification uh meets the meets the concern so I'm prepared to be supportive of this guess Council results just so I can understand what exactly it is that this body has the authority to decide here is it about whether or not the agreement is sufficient um that that the council thinks that the agreement of the fence and the shrubs is sufficient to alleviate concern or is it just about the council determining that the code has been met with the fence and the shrubs Mr attorney would you like to give that a chance a shot I would think it's the ladder we're we're here to decide whether the code is being met including the provisions for an adjustment so even if it was the case where you know the council felt like oh the threes the trees would be a nice benefit but the fence and the shrubs is minimally sufficient to meet the code then that's all the council is here to determine that's correct okay thank you further discussion ready to vote all right will Rec call please call the rooll councelor nordik i councelor vanney i councelor Stapleton I councelor nishioka I councelor Phillips absent councelor Gwyn I councelor Gonzalez I councelor Hoy I mayor Hoy I motion passes all right on to item 5A the multiple unit housing tax tax incentive program is that you miss rord yes that is me great yes do you it are you going to start with the presentation or the no I don't have the formal presentation but just to provide a recap of where things were left at the last meeting and where we stand today so the project in question the High Street um is proposing to meet the 15% affordability requirement for a 10-year property tax the it with Council approval it would then have to go to the school district and their approval would have to be secured to provide the full tax abatement the um you know as previously discuss the project is not currently subject to prevailing wage prevailing wage is Guided by state law uh tax abatements uh whether it's in an Enterprise Zone or whether it's a m tip program um tax exemptions do not fall under prevailing wage law so the considerations then are the affordability component and prior Council policy has set the affordability component at 15% of units for for developments that are more than 50 units um Council also always has the prerogative to change that policy I'm uh here and the developers here to answer any further questions that you may have about that or the impacts that not obtaining the tax ex exemption would have on the project thank you m retherford I think it would be some helpful context if you could just remind us what the mo tip is all about and what the purposes sure so the M tip program was established under State Statute to incentivize in kind of City centers and around Transportation corridors it is not designed to be an affordable housing program so the affordability piece was something that Council chose to add as a uh so to in as as develop Ms um want to obtain this tax exemption uh it's a way to incentivize getting affordable units within a market rate development so we've done something similar with our single property urban renewal areas um adding an affordability requirement in a mixed use development is a good way to kind of jump start uh getting affordability in developments but there's there's kind of a threshold or a Tipping Point when um it impacts the feasibility of projects okay so the purpose is not affordability the purpose is to generate more units and more units in a denser environment in City centers thank you I think that was some helpful background for those not super familiar with mu tip are there other questions for staff or for the developer councelor Nordic sure uh thank you director Redford so if we were to approve this tonight the staff recommendation is basically to adopt the resolution approving the tax exemption under mtip how much of a tax exemp exemption are we talking about over 10 years time if you had to Total how much money we would not be collecting in taxes I don't have that number at my fingertips if I can go back to the staff report and take your time a moment so what we have included in the staff report is 179,000 for the first year of abatement so multiply that by a factor of 10 and we're also looking at so what we're like 1.7 million at that point okay 1.8 okay and you know the reason I mention it is because you know we we definitely have received some written testimony and comments online that how can the city afford to be giving tax breaks right now given our financial strain you now how how would you respond to that I mean it's I know it's property tax exemptions and not asking you to provide a political opinion or anything but how I'm sure this isn't the first time you've gotten this reaction and testimony so the answer to that question is that this abatement has zero impact to the city's general fund mhm so if we did not provide this exemption it doesn't help our general fund situation at all because this property is located within an urban renewal area so it's the urban renewal area that would foro the receipt of that",

        "text": " think is throwing some through me too when i was trying to think about answer the question that's just a publication of the 2020 work so it's not a different study there's a study in 2020 which we did in our you we we put out there through boehm and then through pnnl technical report literature and then we took it to a peer-reviewed journal in 2021 and now we have a new study that launched late 21 early 22 on the southern oregon northern transmission then maybe to the the to mike's question about the the failure of um you know any single generator i mean the way floating officer win will have to comply with the the same requirements of any generator so you know if a natural gas plant fails it might be you're right that there are different you know it's not failing in the ocean and maybe it doesn't create a no sales zone so that that piece is different but in terms of the power system um and that piece should should be considered of course but in terms of the power system it's a contingency either way whether it's a natural gas plant that doesn't fire up because it's too hot out and it hasn't been run much or if it's an offshore wind plant that has a mechanical failure or or even even if it's a spectacular failure it's still a loss of a generator and the system has to be designed so it can handle that that's an n minus one condition so and actually it's it's almost less than n minus one because typically these generators there are many generators in a in a utility scale wind plant each turbine is a generator so if one fails the implication of the power system is usually not that large because there are many others on the wind park to compensate or or the or the individual failure is not that much in terms of active or reactive power contributions but either way if there was a failure of an entire wind plant and that that is something that the power system has to be planned for and so there are contingency and reliability uh you know requirements that sean alluded to earlier that have to be met regardless of what the type of generation is thanks travis mike had a really great question about um state by state adoption of renewable energy goals and understanding of how power systems and sources are tied together via a shared transmission system our renewable power being exported and across state lines and how accounting for associated renewable energy targets accomplished and just say want to say mike thank you for that question thank you for your interest there that's like one of the main things that our agency works on and just really appreciate the interest and one of our um parts of our mission is providing education on these very complex technical pieces so just really appreciate the question and wanted to make sure that folks knew that adam responded with how regional collaboration coordination is really important in the power sector it happens now but there's also efforts to increase regional coordination in the pacific northwest and the west more broadly so that you know different states and and areas of states can um benefit from different types of renewable resources depending on what those are um so greater cooperation is definitely a piece of the puzzle um and there's a website that we the oregon department of energy has created and maintained called the electricity resource mix which will break down what resources are used by utility territory as well as information about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy harding in the chat had a few points on showing more carbon dioxide is produced and removed and some uh links to a study um so thank you for for from berkeley and then i'm gonna i don't see any others in the chat hopefully i summarized all of those and i see a hand raised from harvey so i'm going to turn it to harvey thank you i just kind of follow up on that chat about that dutch uh wind generator collapsed uh i i used to work for bonneville and uh i was talking to one of our construction inspectors we were building a substation for a wind farm out in eastern washington i think it was near and this has been a while back but anyway uh the uh one of the uh they were assembling one of these wind generator towers and it collapsed and killed one of the workmen and uh the construction inspector had osha was there investigating it and our inspector went and took a look at what was what was the problem and it turned out the uh outer skin of the uh column of the wind generator was just photogenic it looks but when you looked in an interior it was coldly corroded out uh it was fabricated in different places in asia one was the design was done in ho chi minh city vietnam fabrication of the some of the parts were done in china and other parts were in thailand and that's all again all put together and apparently there was a lot of on the interior of the uh of the uh of that um column you're going to need a lot of corrosion uh i don't know coatings and cathodic protection perhaps but you're going to have to really pay attention to corrosion because that could weaken your structure and cause a collapse and i will have other comments about storage i got an idea but i'll throw it out but we'll do that later thank you oh great thanks harvey not seeing any other um kathy did have a clarifying comment about the um dac the direct air capture um i think for uh chris in terms of it if it turned out to be difficult to or transmit all the electricity that would be generated some could be used for like local hydrogen or direct air which would allow it to be co2 negative okay thank you so much for all of the engagement on this topic of reliability we had actually scheduled a 10-minute break we're pretty behind schedule though so i just wanted to get a sense from folks about whether you would prefer to take up maybe a shorter break and then dive into about 45 minutes of transmission um take a take a lunch break now and then cover transmission afterwards folks want to kind of provide a preference in the chat that would help us to sort of align the agenda give people a few minutes to think about it so the options are to take a take a short break right now and then come back during part of the lunch hour to discuss or to take a lunch break now and then cover transmission after a half hour lunch break i want to make sure marty on the line would be available to to cover transmission after an early lunch break uh yeah that should work for me can you hear me yeah so that'd be in about 30 minutes from now yes that's right so far it seems like people are also hearing my stomach growling so maybe so far i'm seeing more interest in having a lunch break now and then heading into transmission uh thanks for that feedback so jason i think on slide 62 we have it just says break 10 minutes maybe we can change that to say lunch break um come back at 12 30 or 12 25 sorry 12 25. thanks everyone for all of this engagement we had tried to build in a break but it was such a such good questions and engagement sorry for not providing a break earlier um but we will see you back here at 12 25 to dive into a topic that we've gotten a lot of feedback on which is transmission hope you all get a chance to get something to eat and we'll see you i'm gonna give people just another minute here to get back to their hey can you all hear me just wanted to test my audio before everyone gets back and just to double check i think jason will be just handling master slide deck so i shouldn't worry about sharing screen okay great all right i'm going to get us started again hopefully you're back from our lunch break thanks for your flexibility as we adjusted the agenda um so we have coming back from the lunch we have a topic on transmission infrastructure for floating offshore wind and i'm going to pass it over to jason okay thanks everybody welcome back um well first here from national renewable energy lab on this agenda item and then um they'll cover a 2021 transmission study um that kind of built off some of the work travis travis talked to us about and then i'll swing back to me and then um talk about some additional transmission that are under consideration and in the for the region that some people brought those up um earlier on the call as well so marty schwartz is a power systems engineer who works on modeling transmission systems for the national renewable energy lab he completed that 2021 transmission study i which looked at floating offshore wind interconnecting to oregon's grid which is being used to support bohm's call area as well and so marty is going to share a summary of that study highlights of the study's limitations and caveats and share the key findings that he found that relate to the challenges and benefits of interconnecting floating offshore wind into the existing transmission system turn off okay great so yeah i think there's a we have a bunch of takeaways here um but first off this is pretty similar to travis's study from travis representing piano there so rather than focus on the offshore wind profiles themselves and their i'm going to focus more on some of the specific transmission related analysis that we did and how it how this offshore wind in oregon can connect to the broader western interconnection um really the whole system for the entire western connection act works together so we have to model all that at once and we'll look a little bit further afield from oregon um so i'll just give a like a one or two minute overview of the study itself and then dive right into the transmission takeaways and then hopefully leave as much time as possible for questions so i hope to be talking less than 10 minutes just myself so great yeah so diagram on the upper left shows our workflow for a lot of our large-scale grid integration studies so this is similar to how an integrated resource plan will work for just kind of your run-of-the-mill integrated resource plan for utilities where you start with the capacity expansion model that finds the cost optimal build out of a few for a future year and then you translate that into a production cost model which finds the cost optimal operations of that infrastructure so this just similar to travis's study this was a",

        "text": " the reason we chose and we recommended to the board the Madison Oaks is they did win a tax credit. There's a lot of activity happening in that corridor. So if they're moving forward with projects, we certainly did not want to not support that effort, but it was clear to them that next year will be a little bit more of a competitive process. Are these the same projects that I went to a meeting and I didn't thoroughly understand it. I brought it back to you. I know Gainesville had like seven projects. We had one where they were not paying ad valorem taxes. They were removed from the tax. So you might be speaking. I remember that. And we had that discussion. I think that's the same type of project she's talking about. So there. So not to conflate. So there's a tax credit through Florida housing finance, the 9% tax credit. Then there's the live local. So if a developer wants to. To apply for what's called the missing middle and receive a tax abatement, and they have a step system. So 40% of their project is going to be affordable, 20% is going to be affordable. They have to actually submit an application to Florida housing finance, get approved. Florida Housing finance then sends an approval letter to our property appraiser. They review it, and then the property appraiser would do the tax abatement. That doesn't come through our department, but. So there is a complete process, and it is easy to get both confused in. Definitely it was. It was going to be significant. It is significant to some communities. I mean, huge, hundreds of millions of dollars, I think. And that is totally different than what she was the project she mentioned that it's the tax credit application that I think we. They got approved for phase one. That's correct. And now we are supporting them for phase two, correct? That's correct. So the tax credit, it's a 9% tax credit, essentially like a 0% loan to a developer to produce. In this case, we'll say Madison Oaks. It's a phase two. It would be another 96 units that they'll actually get funding to build, construct. What you're speaking about with the missing middle and the abatement is literally waiving property taxes to a property backed. And I wasn't prepared to bring this up, but I will because Marion county has a surplus of 120% AMI affordable units. Marion county has the choice to opt out of offering that missing middle piece. If we decided to opt out, we would have to do that on an annual basis. We do have in the city two projects that were approved by Florida housing finance for that missing middle piece. Cheryl, I was just going to ask you about the frontline staff again, getting back to the workload, but yet you've not requested anybody this year in the budget. Is that something that you could go back and reconsider? I mean, do we not have the funding out of those grants? We do not. She is requesting one position in her proposed budget, which we will be discussing, discussing in July, in addition to the code officer, which will be in the gross services budget. But she is funding, and I mean, her funding is running very. We are now subsidizing her operation a little bit from the general fund and the code enforcement officer, because of the eligibility, is being funded out of the grant. So it's not having to come out of my admin caps. So I guess I just thought with the funding that we have, that we would have money to cover administrative costs. It's not enough. Okay. Yeah, moving on. These are. And this is why we've had to sort of narrow our focus, and you'll see as we move forward. So our homeless service core focus areas, this is where we have a lot of funding. Not a lot of money. Not a lot of money. Not a lot of money. So I want to share that. So, as you see, we have 123456 buckets of funding sources. The era two and home Arp are going to go away. Home arp we have for another five years. Era two, another two years. HESG is county entitlement funding. That's part of our five year consolidated plan and annual action plan. And then the TANF, the temporary assistant for needy families, the challenge in the Emergency Solutions grant is part of the continuum of care joint office on Homelessness funding. So my recommendation on the homeless core areas is for us to begin researching co locating the city and county offices together. The city's responsibility is to manage the homeless management information system, also affectionately known as hmIs. It is our data, data drives priorities, and so that's been a huge missing link with communication among the teams. So having the teams co locate to start discussing and analyzing those data and driving decisions is very important if we're gonna continue to operate under the county's umbrella. And then there has been some discussion about homeless in our rural areas. You know, the city has four outreach officers. We are in discussion with the city about having their outreach team start training some of our county employees, such as the libraries, parks, and rec animal services, on how they. There's a lot of homeless folks that go to the libraries that are in the parks. They're not sure how to interact with them. How can we get them in the hmIs? How can we documentous that these people are living in our rural communities? Because I don't know that we're capturing that accurately. So we would like to start determining what that looks like. Chip and I went to the Florida association of county meeting last year, talked to Palm beach. They implemented this program, and it's been very successful. Having some of the library staff interact, having some of the parks people interact, getting them in the system so that we can at least have a better look at what we're dealing with. So, if I may, do you believe we're missing them? And the point in time counts as well, then it's my opinion that we might be, yes. Okay. And then our human service focus areas, as mentioned, we have the non avalorum, which will start in July. We have a budget of 25,000. I believe that ends. So it's important as you are meeting with citizens. Our application opens July 1 and will end September 30. Sorry, September 1. July 1 through September 1. And that's just to pay for the non avalorum portion of their taxes. And then we have the we care, which is a free service we offer, and we partner with Heart of Florida and the Marion County Medical Society. And then our unclaimed bodies program. Roberts Funeral Home, downtown chapel, still doing a fantastic job for us. And then our health Care responsibility act. Those applications, I found out, do take some time. So that's been a little bit of a heavy lift on staff, and we have launched the opioid settlement committee, so that is coming forward. And in the new budget. I am requesting to add a community development manager to help with that, along with some of the human services that we just shared in our department. Go ahead, Kathy. You may need to answer this, but on the opioid settlement, do we have to expend the money each year that we get, or can it accumulate? No. And if you will go to your. So I do want. This is important. There's been a lot of scuttlebutt about opioid dollars and who receives it. What I am discussing here is specifically the regional opioid settlement funds that the county and city. So if you go to trying to figure out which, it's the very last chart under funding sources. We shared with you how the funding is broken down. So Marion county is considered a qualified county by Department of children and Families. And so the city and county, as you know, enter into a lawsuit. Together, we qualified for a regional opioid settlement. We will receive funding over the next 18 years. Currently, we have approximately $5.7 million in our account. Marion county has its own bucket of opioid money that the board can decide on how that is used. And we are looking at about 1.25 million currently available. And then the city of Ocala has its own bucket, which is about 348,000. Now, there's a disclaimer on the bottom of that page that the city of Mcintosh, Reddick and Dinellan and Bellevue will also receive funding, but they will receive it directly to them. I know that we discussed them interfacing with us, but amounts are so small that for them to go through the process of putting together the plan. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. So we're still working on. So we're still working on that. And the next opioid settlement with the county, or we don't know there. Well, the money goes directly to them. So what we're going to have to do is get with them and have. Basically have the money do some kind of transferred over to the county. Yes. Yeah. It's going to be. It's going to be meshed with the county money, not the regional money. Yeah. So that's, that's still in the works. But I did want to put that disclaimer that there are other buckets out there, but they're small. I understand. Okay. All right. So that's, that's opioid. And demystify. Demystifying that for you. So then our vision for the next year is. This is my proposed.org chart. It's slightly different. You'll see that? I added a community development manager and just kind of redistributed. The two vacant positions are my Coc manager and CoC coordinator. We are coordinating with HR at the moment to start advertising those positions, to strategically hire",

        "text": " with the echo project it's directly adjacent to it so now that we've done that let's um let's take a look at some things related to this and the first place i'm going to go is with the military layers since the military under this and we've talked about uh we should talk about the potential conflicts with with military uses i want to click on some of those layers so as i do that bear with me just a second because one of the things that i know is nearby is the boardman geographic area of so you can see up here at the top we get some overlap here with one of these layers i just clicked on so if you're using this you might want to know what is that exactly and hopefully you can can read that and maybe i need to make that a little bigger and it off the one i wanted there we go so up here when i click on that you can see it highlights that layer and it tells you that's the boardman geographic area of you know as we if we're looking at a project like this that's immediately going to tell us you know the military needs to be contacted and aware that there's a that is overlapping with one of their so moving on from there you know there are a lot of layers in here we could end up doing this all day i promise you we won't there are a couple of things though that i want to point out so one of them is under the energy infrastructure you can see there's a layer in here for the oregon energy facility site and council so if we click on that lo and behold all of our f-sec facilities come up as was the case before we can make those a little darker or a little lighter another thing that may be of interest here on wind turbines so if you are interested in seeing for exactly where wind turbines are located this layer has all of them i'm going to decrease the darkness a little on the f-sec facilities obviously it's going to overlap with a lot of that but as we zoom in you know you can actually see those individual points in here did that also show those on the washington side wind turbines kind of look like i thought the washington design it probably does yeah and you know depending on where the data is coming from will you know determine you know the range of the data that we have and of course some of it's going to be outside of the oregon borders okay so again i'm going to kind of put my citing analyst hat on and say okay we have this new project what other things might we want to look i'm going to get back here to where we have our two projects showing so how about wetlands that's one and there are different wetland layers that are in here i have a few of them clicked on and when i click on wetlands overall you'll see things start popping up here it's a transmission line see here there we go so now that we're zoomed in a little bit and it's had a chance to to load this layer you can see you know where it's showing any wetlands and you know if if we want to know what are those you know these are smaller they're part of the streams and rivers that i'm clicking on and off but it would it would be something that the analyst would want to make sure was being considered as we were looking at the effects of the and you can click on these data layers to get more information if you're curious about well what is that layer really it gives you a good description of what's behind that so the last one that i wanted to show you here is farmland since that always comes up farmland and soil classifications so if i click on farmland soil class you can see this thing really lights up and let's go out just a little bit and you can see these are color-coded so this this bright green says all areas are prime got not prime farmland prime farmland have drained and so forth let's say well i'd like to to know a little bit more about this this bright green area so if i click on this i think i'm going to have to reduce my zoom a little and we can zoom back in again if we need so i clicked on a point and then right click and it comes up with this find data on the map and when i do that you can see i get this pop-up over here with farmland soil class and it says farmland of statewide importance and it highlights this area that's marked like that if i want to know a little bit more about it and i click on that arrow for more now i can actually see what that soil type is i'll show you one more before we we wrap this up so that was farmland soil class let's look at irrigated soil class and again we get you know pretty colorful view here but let's click on one of these that looks like it's overlapping with the project boundary and do the same thing and here it says irrigated soil capability class class 3 so that's and then it gives you a description of what falls under that and again we've got the details on that particular area so you get the idea um i mean it's a technical tool um but it has tons of of information in it and um you know as we talk to people so these data layers that are in here pretty much they're they're publicly available layers and you know again if you're in this business you probably know where to look for these things and where to find them but the thing that to me is really unique about the saresa tool it pulls them all together into one place it's one stop shopping this tool is going to be maintained by inr so odo has basically signed up for a maintenance contract with inr to maintain this tool and make sure that the layers are kept up to date you know for example as fsec facilities are are added those will be added as new uh maybe become available that would be relevant those can be added and the ones that are in there will be updated so pretty powerful tool and i think that's about it again i want to express our thanks to dod for their funding and for the more than the funding the participation of the project so kim was great to work with on this project as was todd farmer who's her colleague and uh he wasn't available to join us today but uh both of them have been a huge help and have big participants in this project and making it successful we'll stop there and see if you have any yeah just a couple of things to add so you know i'd ask the question before just to make sure everybody knew that you don't need you know any specific software other than you know the up-to-date web browser as well he talked about so if your average person they can access this information also if you have gis you know wally showed that you can upload shape files into the the system you can also download them from the system as well so i mean so if somebody whether it's county or you know some other organization that actually has gis it can be very very useful um bringing again uploading uh layers or downloading layers as well so you know it's it's really available for your average person but also i would say the more sophisticated gis users um the other thing that we wally and i actually just talked about is you know things can be overwhelming for people who don't have much background and there's a lot of layers there's a lot of detail so we i think are going to have some discussions about um you know whether it's a like a video recording on how to how what your average person can access and kind of march through this or hand handouts so i think as we move because obviously we want to make our process as transparent as possible and this is such a great equalizer of information we want to make sure your average person can access and utilize this data readily so we'll be working on those also tools to make it uh more accessible for people as well quick question maybe a stupid one so uh protected areas that we saw do those correlate at all with for instance our protected or what we would consider as protected areas so so as you analyze is it all there um thank you councilman condon um i don't know if there's a layer specifically for fsec protected areas i'd have to look at that again but i'm sure that the layers that are in there for protected areas do encompass the ones that are in the council's standards at a minimum and and many more and you know again we could we could spend hours literally just going through all the layers that are in there i mean it's fascinating you know you find yourself going down rabbit holes when you when you go in here for that reason but um it's it's quite comprehensive i will say that heard ann beyer just thank you again to the department of defense and kim for her work shepherding this through i was one of the original guinea pigs for local governments on this tool and it's so exciting to see come to fruition i think some guidance for local governments and local gis staff i don't know that they know that there's such a powerful tool out here so very excited to see this and just to remind the public that play with this you cannot break it they have designed it so you can't break it so kudos to the team for bringing this to fruition thank you anyone else all right thanks wally um our next agenda item is the public comment period this is an information item this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment items closed for comment include the board menta hemingway transmission line project which is in the contested case process as well as the 2022 carbon standards rulemaking protected areas rulemaking and wildfire rulemaking i will ask nancy to take over to see if we have folks wanting to comment and then if there's anyone in the room madam chair i do not see any public comments on the line is there anyone in the audience who is ready to make a public comment i do not see any hands raised all right let's just give it a minute and see if anyone's listening and decides to uh want to speak would you mind going over the rules for how to do so please i have it pulled up nancy i can it's okay for those of you using the webex you will need to use the raise your hand feature for those on the phone only you will need to press star",

        "text": " not enough momentum moving that direction just on our own as utilities and so especially you know you look at this and appreciate uh commissioner tawny's uh recognition that there's 30 30 plus bas um all kind of doing their own thing when we're trying to leverage the diversity of a region so this is incredibly important there's a lot of complexity to it uh but i would i would say that if if oregon washington if we all want to get where we need to go from a from a grid this particular issue is is probably a number one from my perspective and frank you um follow a question there that's irrespective of an rto i assume rto or not all right that need exists yeah and i and i think what the what an rto can do is first of all can provide better visibility as to the priorities to make that happen which then can facilitate the investments and equitably share that cost and benefit across the region but without that it's it's too distributed and as individuals we probably don't always see those returns or even understand the complete complete picture so i think an rto provides the visibility and and the motivation uh and the return on the investments to make it happen you know i think nicole is right you don't see a lot of sort of new investments even though we all recognize there's this constraint so i think an rto really stimulates that any other comments on that thought it's a i know it's a it's a big topic of discussion um also i just wanna uh while you're thinking about that um remind everyone and this is something i probably should have put on my slides here but uh seeing representative marsh is a good reminder for me that let's think also as we're thinking about uh how to respond to these questions of um how to um provide input that's of value to the legislature right what what are the kind of issues uh that would be helpful for them to better understand because to the extent we talk about them here how we can elevate and highlight those in our report back to the legislature at the end of the year so so adam this is kathy um so one of the excuse me i wanted to point out too is you know as an entity who has been trying to build transmission for for quite a while you know with b2h i think one of the things to remember too is that regardless of the transmission planning process um you know i think an rto would be you know as pointed out it would be more transparent um but you still have those hurdles such as permitting and signing and nepa and all of those other things that actually i think from idaho power standpoint makes getting this transmission built maybe even more complex than a potential cost allocation because you can you know show a need you know to your regulators and and get that going and moving from an irp perspective but what really tends to hold things up tends to be a lot of that other governmental red tape in the sighting and the permitting processes so i don't know what oregon can do about that specifically but i think you know that we have to keep in mind that the rto is not the ultimate you know solution to to getting transmission build we personally at idaho power feel like transmission is the key to unlocking the clean energy future that all of us need um we've you know we've just got to have those pipelines to be able to move the um but it really is a lot of that other stuff than just the group of the willing right i think we have some group of willings it's just some of those other processes that really bog you down kathy frank nicole or anyone else on this topic and maybe it's a little off topic for our kios but are there any best practices out there in this regard that you see from other parts of the that you would highlight for us so that you think we should be aware of or are you asking related to the sighting to the sighting and just uh all these uh the transmission barriers that have been identified here i mean we have a very unique situation in oregon and the west in general as it relates to fighting and permitting these some of these barriers that we experience here we don't experience in other regions that said we also have an agreed upon higher expectation for environmental protection and equity and cultural resources important things that we have to balance here so i'm not going to say there's a good model out there on these issues that we should look at i just think and i'm wondering you know i i totally agree with what kathy's saying here like oregon has some sighting issues that we have to address that's something that renewable northwest has been you know trying to push on for for years i wonder the benefit of having you know a regional conversation around like this right here this particular project whatever it is is so important not just to oregon but to the region if that helps push the needle on moving some of these projects through some difficult permitting processes i mean i think that there's a you know when it becomes not just important for one utility and one utility's ratepayers i think there's a little bit more push behind getting it then maybe i'm wrong this is mary this is mary i would i would just kind of um add on a little bit to what kathy was saying you know a pacific or obviously you know working for many years to get significant transmission built and and i think you know there are a lot of challenges that i think are separate from rtos in terms of like what kathy was saying citing and you know in the west we have also a lot more public public lands um that can be a real challenge as well to kind of kind of navigate those issues i think though we look at the benefit of an rto really to have kind of a coordinated space to try to conduct the transmission planning i don't think it's a panacea in terms of cost allocation necessarily um because i think you still have a lot of um horse trading around sort of how how costly allocated how that works um but i also think that the there is a benefit in terms of from a jurisdictional perspective that you have kind of a fork home for making decisions around transmission and transmission rates instead of kind of a very sort of vulcanized approach that we have now with with each state really really not and not in a bad way but each state needing to take its own kind of local interests in mind that can kind of um uh preempt or be prioritized over a broader regional interest um so i think i do think rto kind of puts it in a regional context as opposed to kind of a sort of state-by-state context that we have now i wanted to lay a finer point on that i agree with all of the comments so far and i'm certainly a big believer in the benefits of transmission but for purposes of laying out the pros and cons associated with these choices for this work you know one of the functions of the rto is to federalize the decision making around transmission projects are going to get built to the rto footprint and that although that is a stakeholder process it is ultimately in the hands of the market operator to decide what projects are going to get forward at least based on today's construct and who it will be built by who can then rate base those um projects that's not necessarily the entity that proposes the project that's today's construct i recognize that ferc is actively asking a lot of questions about what that should look like going forward but when the market operator makes that choice and that project goes forward generally speaking again based on the constructs that exist in rpos today word benefit is interpreted very broadly is interpreted really on the theory that element facility that might be built by the rto and it might happen to be in one or two states because of its high voltage bulk support reliability support whatever the metric is it's going to all the customers potentially of that footprint so you're going to see oregon required to fund through a federal work jurisdictional tariff that the states aren't going to have a lot of ability to um to do something different those customers are going to pay for that asset now i believe that assets and on a bulk network system benefit all users i don't really care what state the asset is in but historically in our region even based on a non-rto world that has been sometimes a difficult pill to swallow for some states pacific or sorry mary it's a great example because of your broad footprint you know you've built bulk assets in the utah area in your in your history with energy gateway and that should be a cost spread by the in the entire network of all the states that are part of that networked grid that operates to serve those customers but historically that has not always gone smoothly in every state where those assets have been placed into rates now we don't have a ferc jurisdictional rto tariff so you have to argue at ferc and you have to argue in each state to get cost recovery for those assets so in that sense rto is attractive to someone who would like to see transmission built because it will take some of the state dialogue and debate out of the arena and i just want to be very clear about that because we have stakeholders here who represent state interests but that is one of the pro consequences of moving in this direction this is a great discussion just one more thing to add to to kind of pile on to what sarah's saying i do think that it doesn't mean that the states are completely removed from the conversation but then it emphasizes that governance structure where the states have the ability to participate and weigh in but in a different way um and and i think also you know for pacific or you know we don't our system doesn't really have a government structure you know we actually kind of our mini rto honestly uh our little system and but but we don't really have a governance structure and so from our perspective i think an rto is attractive because it's not just you know sort of taking away states jurisdiction and putting in ferc it's really creating a format and a and a structure to enable decision making and process different perspectives from different states kind of in an effort um in a for in a much more formal way than anything we have now we just don't we don't have there's no you're not just for pac",

        "text": " development in those two areas through the eligible Equity boost thank you so we've had the benefit of and the opportunity for questions and comments at this juncture I would like to ask if there is a motion to authorize the interim direct executive director to negotiate and execute a purchase and sale agreement to begin due diligence for property at one five seven five one Northwest Bruegger Road is there a second we have emotion uh and a second all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you directors any opposed the motion carries unanimously seven to and we'll leave you right here and ask you to please speak to us on the second action item for today with regard to Wood Spring Apartments thank you director our chair Harrington and board of directors again my name is Andrew Crampton development manager and I'm here to give an update on the woodspring apartment acquisition and to seek your authority to authorize the existence of revenue bonds and the acquisition of woodspring and I will be less verbose with this presentation just for context as folks know woodspring Apartments 172 unit property in Tigard that had a 30-year emphasizing that the intent with this acquisition is to both preserve affordability at the building and also preserve housing stability for all residents including Market residents that have moved in um some of the deal Logistics since the board authorized waiving contingencies in in April and and having the authority move move towards the purchase um the project will have an issued uh Revenue bond in the amount to not exceed 20.5 million and though those proceeds will finance a portion of the um I was remiss in the beginning of the presentation we also have available online as a panelists uh Bond Council from Foster Garvey that has been assisting The Authority with the the bond financing in the acquisition and their their help has been tremendous and they're available if there's any technical questions on the bond components as well as our development consultant from Broner and company that has assisted greatly the with with the acquisition and moving our our project forward with our three financing sources so I'll do my best to answer questions but if there's any technical questions or authority review that require Bond or Development Council there they're also online as as well so as in addition to the the up to 20.5 million dollar um tax-exempt Revenue Bond and that'll be um issued by ban that'll be issued by the authority um and provided by Banner Bank Oregon housing community service has really stepped up through their push preservation funding and committed 25 million in a a loan to pursue acquisition for the property and then the authority will contribute up to four million dollars from from local fund um 1.5 million of that will be held for immediate Capital needs that were identified during our review of the building to make sure that the the building is continues to be high quality and really prepares for the long-term syndication of the property these these revenue bonds were structured in a way that will allow within three to five years to have a a 4 syndication for substantial upgrades to the building to really continue the the useful life so in particular the the Oregon housing community service grant funding would be absorbed into that tax credit partnership we've had conversations with the state about that and they're aware of of that incoming planned syndication in addition the the revenue bond is structured in that the first two years of the bond will be interest-only payments and no prepayment penalty so these funds are structured for that long-term work that we expect and funding Leverage um so again the issuance of the revenue Bond will have a fixed rate of 5.37 which in today's day's climate is really competitive because of the ability to have a tax exempt where the the interest payments are not subject to federal tax um and the scale of the project is as well allows for that that favorable interest rate um after the first two years the principal and interest on the bond shall be payable and monthly installments but again no prepayment penalty so that'll be folded into the the syndication in three to five years some of the approval items that have been prepared um through both Bond Council and legal counsel and County Council review is the execution and delivery of the bond and then Associated Deeds that you'll you'll see in any standard real estate transaction trust deed documents certificates and then and the post issuous compliance policy and procedures to make sure that the tax exempt nature of the bond is is preserved and there isn't any private purpose funding that would put the eligibility of tax exempt in Jeopardy so that's where our legal counsel is is available and has been guiding the authority on the standards and parameters of the the tax exempt bond to make sure that we continue to be compliant post issuance um and then the second action resolution is to prove the acquisition and really authorize the officers of the authority to execute and record project documents and approve the the borrowing by the ohcs loan um to not to exceed the 25 million and then similar to the the tax exempt Bond um to have the associated closing documents that have have been prepared and are are ready for execution including the promissory note to ohcs and Loan agreement as well as securitization and and Trust Deeds one of the components with the regulatory agreement that's critical and really is important in our preservation efforts is a a 60-year affordability Covenant that will be associated with the property it's our our mission and our intent of course as an authority to to pursue preservation of affordability but this is is in addition to intent this regulatory agreement will be legally binding for that affordability um next steps for the acquisition is assuming approval by the board is to then execute and record closing in addition we intended men assign the property management agreement with the existing property management company this will be approximately a one-year duration to have stability at the building and then the authority will long-term seek a procurement RFP I'm an evaluation for for permanent property management but due to the the timeline the existing infrastructure in place the the amendment and the assignment is the the really the real the all the in the only realistic path to to continue in the short term the intent then is to complete the acquisition and then the authority intends to meet in person with building residents to discuss the transition and really prepare for voucher eligibility our voucher requirements our voucher eligibility requires exhausting all existing residents to see if they're available to apply for project-based vouchers before we open up uh vacant units and units at churn over to pull from our existing voucher wait lists as was discussed and has been underwrited underwritten during our due diligence prior to waiving contingencies as vacant units and units at turnover are intended to be filled with with project-based vouchers and we've we've planned for that accordingly for up to 33 project-based vouchers for the property and then we'll you will then prepare the scope for needed Capital work that will be funded both through the Housing Authority Reserve that we're holding but also operations cash flow from the the least units to work on things like carport replacement siding repair gutter components immediate identity certified work at the property and with that I will close and ask if there's any questions or concerns prior to seeking authorization approval and approval of issuance of bonding well it's been a long two and a half years since the period of affordability ended on wood Springs and this apartment complex is in the heart of commissioner Rogers District and I know he had has had a long two and a half years of entertaining phone calls meetings with area state legislators the Tigard Mayors Tigard City councilors staff Neighbors would you like to start with any questions or comments my only comment is uh let's get it approved both of them other directors any questions or seeing none I am thrilled that we're at this point uh I will be following up with you because there is a term of art that I think I need to become more familiar with and that is push preservation funding so I'll I'll follow up with you on that so at this juncture we have two different resolutions uh to move forward with this item and I want to make sure we uh have separate motions and votes on each of them so there's no question that we've authorized both so I will read the titles of each the first in the matter of authorizing the issuance of a revenue Bond of the authority in principle amount not to exceed 20 million five hundred thousand dollars to finance a portion of the cost of acquiring the wood Spring authorizing the execution and delivery of the bond a trust deed and other agreements documents and certificates authorizing the sale and delivery of the bond to Banner Bank adopting post-issuance compliance policies and procedures and determining related manners matters do we have a motion on set resolution enthusiastically from director Rogers do we have a second we have a second from director Roper all those in favor please vote by raising your hands or arms thank you directors any opposed that resolution passes on a vote of seven to zero passage unanimously and now the second one in the matter of authorizing the Acquisitions of wood Spring authorizing the acceptance of a loan from the state of Oregon acting by and through its Housing and Community Services Department to finance a portion of the costs of such acquisition authorizing property transfer documents loan documents and other agreements documents and certificates and determining related matters do we have such a motion we have a motion from director Rogers II from director Roper all those in favor please vote by raising your hands or arms or saying aye thank you directors any opposed the motion carries unanimously seven to zero congratulations to all of you been a long two and a half years and we are grateful for your practicing the art of the possible at every step of the way thank you and we're also grateful to the state of Oregon for making the funds available for the acquisition of wood Spring Apartments what a terrific day thank you and next that brings us to the second public comment period of today's Housing Authority board of directors meeting clerk Moss thank you director Harrington I did not see anyone come into the room and sign up did I miss anyone see once forward so we do have one hand online Cheyenne Cheyenne can you hear us yes thank you very much um thank you Board of Directors for letting me address this meeting yes I remember talking to Joss kritz back two and a half years ago and as a resident I'll try not to tear up but",

the Department's draft order and at the hearing the hearing itself will be an opportunity to provide public comment and testimony we ordinarily have a computer set up to uh present a mapping tool that can be used uh locate the facility um but it is not currently working now the next couple slides I'll provide a general overview of the energy facility siding Council the amendment process and public participation next slide please this slide provides a quick overview of this agenda item as I just said I'll provide a brief overview of the FC process and of the approved facility as well as the amendment request itself then Vice chair Condon will provide an overview of the public hearing and we will conclude the agenda item with the public hearing itself where members of the public May comment on the draft proposed order the amendment request or both Council will also have an opportunity to make comments about any concerns they have related to the draft proposed order Andor the amendment request I did want to note that tonight's hearing is not the close of the public comment period on the draft proposed order or the amendment request the public comment uh period deadline is 5 o'clock pm on March 29th which is next Friday after the close of the public comment period the department recommends that Council leave the record open for an additional business day for the certificate holder to respond to any and all public comments and so the Department's recommending Council leave the record open until 5:00 pm on April 1st or later if requested next slide please okay the the organ Department of Energy's citing division has one primary objective which is to follow its mandate established in 1975 to review large scale energy projects for compliance with applicable standards and rules for reference citing refers to the technical permitting review of a proposed facility against a number a proposed or approved uh facility against a number of standards um based on site specific locational issues that may be affected by any particular facility please note that land Acquisitions land leases and easements are all outside of the fsec review process the Oregon Department of Energy's sighting division serves as staff to the energy facility sighting Council which I'll be referring to as FC Council the council consists of up to seven members serving in a volunteer capacity council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate and represent a diverse background um from across the state diverse locations as well while the organ Department of energy sighting staff makes recommendations to FC FC itself is the final decision-making Authority for energy facilities under its jurisdiction including uh the Leaning Juniper 2A facility and this amendment request next slide this slide illustrates the major steps in the review of requests for amendment to an existing FX site certificate um Nancy will you just click and see if it if there's um an animation there we go cool this amendment request is being processed under the type A Amendment review process which includes a few opportunities for public review and participation including tonight's public the amendment process itself begins with when a certificate holder submits their preliminary request for Amendment and the preliminary request for Amendment for the Leaning Juniper 2A facility was submitted to the department on September 2023 following the pasc the preliminary uh or prfa preliminary request for Amendment uh the department provided public notice of the prfa receipt and that occurred on September 28th in addition to the public notice the department also initiated reviewing agency coordination on this amendment request on February 9th of this year 2024 the department deemed the amendment request complete and on February 14th the certificate holder submitted a complete request for Amendment to the department on February 29th the department issued its draft proposed order for Amendment Three as well as a public notice of the issuance of its draft proposed order and a request for comment on the amendment request the draft proposed order contains the Department's recommendations for Council on the requested Amendment including recommendations for amended site certificate conditions and new conditions um as I mentioned just a couple minutes ago the public comment period will uh will not close until next Friday March 29th following the close of the record the department will review any comments received and will prepare responses is uh to the comments for council's consideration once Council has reviewed the draft proposed order and any and all comments received the department will incorporate council's feedback into its proposed order which is the next step in the the um when the Department issues its proposed order a public notice of the proposed order and contested case will also be issued because this amendment request is being evaluated as a type A Amendment it allows for a possible contested case proceeding to occur only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at this meeting or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft proposed order May partici participate in the contested case if held the contested case proceeding would be run by an independent hearing officer following the deadline for the contested case hearing requests or after the contested case proceeding has concluded the council will review the proposed order and issue its final order approving or denying the request for Amendment the final orders uh findings of facts and conclusions of law are based on the proposed order and the outcome of the contested case the department will prepare the chair the department will prepare and the chair will sign the final order and amended site certificate as approved and directed by Council next slide please Nancy there we go now I'll provide you with an overview of the approved uh leaning Juniper 2A facility uh the Leaning Juniper facility lean Juniper 2A wind power facility is a wind energy facility facility located in Gillum County uh within a site boundary Acres the facility consists of 43 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 492 ft and a peak generating capacity of approximately 90 .3 megaw the facility was originally approved and received its site certificate um by Council on September 2007 the certificate holder for the facility is leaning Juniper wind power LLC who is a a wholly owned subsidiary of auen grid Renewables next slide this slide represents the procedural history um of this amendment request as I mentioned we the department received the preliminary request for amendment in late September of last year September 2023 following initial review of the preliminary request for Amendment the department issu uh determined that additional information was needed and made a request for additional information on November 21st to which the certificate holder provided responses on December 15th then um on February 9th of this year February 9th 2024 the department reviewed the REI

kind of like our interstate system or our rail systems you know it's uh it's about the most efficient way to go is DC over any amount of distance I know that from working it so thank you uh thanks so much for your comment um is there anyone else in the room that has a question or would like to provide a thanks so much thank you uh I'm Wood Anderson and I represent the city of Mosier I got lots of questions but maybe a couple Chris uh Cascade Chris I forget you lasted um you you mentioned your slide said The Dalles Stevenson and Portland I think are the municipalities affected we got the notice here in Moses and as Moser has a bunch of water that or land that's under the Bonneville pool so do you I guess my question goes to your desktop studies to date on don't have the alignment uh actually known yet I mean is Moser not in your your Corridor or is that is that why Moser didn't show up on that slide or not necessarily no I mean I don't I I think as I think Todd pointed out that uh jurisdictionally you know we're expecting that fsec will do the coordination with the municipalities to talk about the route and where it might go the route again is subject to adjustment uh based on uh what is found in the in-depth studies uh so it was certainly not our intent to kind of ignore Mosier yeah uh in terms of an impact to measure uh we would very little or none I think we showed kind of the visual impact of watching a cabling barge go down the river very slowly that's that's about the impact so so again you you don't have the exact determined yet I mean you you haven't gone out and done the surveys in the river we have done some surveys in the uh we have modeled to the extent it's possible on available data the uh sort of topography of the river uh and so from an installation and a constructability point of view that's basically what our preliminary alignment is based on what we need to complete the picture are the Environmental Studies uh and how that route might change based on what we know of in the river as well as the geology and there will be uh quite an extensive uh geological program to know what kinds of sediments we're dealing with and we know that the sediment varies depending on where you are yeah that was kind of my follow-up I know a little bit about the river I'm retired 35 years Corps of Engineers and my last job all these dams operation came under my my team and there's a lot of rock a lot of rock out there too it's not 15 feet of sediment in many areas no so you're not going to drill Rock you're going to put concrete cover I guess where you if I'm going to turn this up I'd like to introduce Ernie Griggs here uh just on issues like this he's certainly better than I am Ernie has been about 40 years in the hvdc business he's been our project manager for both the Neptune and Hudson projects uh and uh he does know more than I do okay well that's debatable but I'll make a compliment anyway um your question is pertinent the riverbed is not just simply said uh silty sediment the whole way and we know that in fact that's actually a couple of the surveys that we did was to try to better understand a couple of of tricky areas one of which chose we chose to actually move the location of the cable that's one of the reasons why you now a somewhat prolonged way around Bonneville Dam was because east of the dam it is really Rocky not little rocky it's a lot Rocky and so we've stayed away from that what we will be doing is once we understand where we think we should put the cable with regards to our Environmental Studies we will then do our detailed survey and we will start to locate it within the riverbed it's going to take some time it's not going to happen in the next six months but over the next couple of years we'll understand where it will be and we'll be able to sit down with everybody and say okay this is where the cable is going and this is how it works and this is this is how we're going to be able to bury it you mentioned concrete mats that's an application that could be also Rock burial could be applied in certain circumstances too so there's Technologies out there that have been we will look to our our OEM our cable manufacturer to help us understand what the different applications are used around the world for the purpose to be able to understand what the right Solutions are here yeah so so I guess I take away the logical conclusion is once you know the actual alignment and the citing council's process there will be a ability to engage like our community with our comprehensive plan or whatever once we know yeah it's actually in mosier's jurisdiction does that sound right yeah yeah okay uh one more question I'll you have my time since I want to dominate uh you you mentioned 1100 megawatts towards the 2030 objectives I think in both states with 80 percent carbon free what's the context for that What What In 2030 the west side load is going to be you know yeah 20 million well it's probably not that much how how much does this project contribute to that goal the numbers keep going up uh if you take the most recent numbers from PGE and uh the utility Puget Sound uh the number that they are offering as potential additional need is north of 5000 megawatts so does our 1100 megawatts add up to 5 000 no it doesn't uh we see ourselves as part of the solution not the solution um uh that said uh as I mentioned at the beginning you know we started our development kind of uh Journey a couple of years ago because we know how long these things take and so our goal is to try to get this done by 2030 to at least be a big help in reaching at least a big part of that goal one more so so will will this capacity just be exclusive Renewables or given it's the grid electrons coming you know coal-fired in Montana can I mean you know maybe that's a silly question but no it's a it's a very pertinent question and uh what we're what we're proposing is uh essentially a piece of major infrastructure so our lines are not our line is not tied into a particular generating plant of whatever kind it's a system that links the East with the West that said uh the laws that were passed in Washington and Oregon publicly with a lot of public input and a lot of public uh we find it highly unlikely that those are going to change and see a reversal uh other than for renewable energy so that's and and I I can't guarantee beyond that you're quite right about the electrons but I I think public policy has already stepped in and and you know answered that question okay uh thank you for your comment uh and just one last track is there anybody else in the room who has a question or would like to provide a comment and if not uh Nancy could you let me know if there's oh do we have one more excellent my name is Rich McCauley I live over in click attack County I'm also a member of IBEW Local 48 uh um so this interests me uh because I'm in the electrical field I'm well aware that our infrastructure in the United States is uh not up to par we need some help or um I'm surrounded out out on the other side of Goldendale by uh solar panels and wind turbines everywhere right so I know they're they're producing clean green energy but it also see them getting shut down periodically these turbines wind turbines and and so I've always wondered why that is and I'm I'm wondering if that's because of transmission do we not have the capacity to transmit and will that help to use that power I apologize I've got a pump going off here will this new transmission line that you're proposing will that help get more of the energy that's produced actually used is that a fair question it is a fair one of the challenges of reli of renewable energy is its variability whether it's solar or wind and what transmission like this does is it gets you broader access more resources because they don't all shut down at the same time and so uh basically what what this tries to accomplish is take the the existing transmission Network and like like Chris said this isn't the only solution but this partial solution helps to get us out Beyond uh our normal supply lines and be able to allow us to get into Wyoming wind and some of the other areas that are going to be able to supply additional renewable energy and that's how it's going to come about but um it's it's going to take it's going to take public policy combined with the existing utilities combined with folks like us putting in new technology to sort of come together and start to make this thing all work because right now what you're seeing is the infancy where they're trying to learn how to walk and they're not there so I hope that helps to answer your question but it does uh one more quick comment I'm obviously also uh I think the local community it's a little selfish on my part because there's going to be a lot of electricians that are going to be building these converter stations uh uh sold for us that's a great thing we got a lot of local electricians that'll benefit from having a job here it looked two to three years for completion of the project I don't know if these converter stations will take that long to build but it'll be good for the local families absolutely a local job not have to travel down the interstate to work I first started working on on hvdc interconnectors back in 1985 and a mentor of mine said if you figure this out and how it works you'll you'll be able to work at this forever and it looks like it's even more so that way well I'm looking forward to seeing seeing how this goes and and it'll cause me to uh dig in a little deeper uh because I'm sure you're well aware there's going to be a lot of I had comments talking about impact of fish a lot of friends that fish what what's the impact you know the EMF and how how's this going to affect my",

        "text": " even since then I think uh well you would talked to to Doug and I to make sure that was okay and I thought that was a fine idea um um uh I think the other thing that's come up is I think we probably are going to look for a more General recommendation to city council so maybe the next meeting we might revisit that letter and uh and say suggest that hey as we're looking at the meeten hunt Runway 1634 memo we actually look at more than just the estimated cost but there may be other things that come into that related to commercial a service and things like that so it might be a slightly different letter that we come back and and resend it but I just wanted to follow up that there was a reason why it hasn't gone to the city council and that we still want to recommend that same goal go ahead I think Mark has oh just some breaking news uh in one of our meetings today uh the Public Works director gave me the go-ahead to schedule a work session with the city council uh this fall on primarily the future of the secondary Runway I get the numbers mixed up excuse me um I do too I didn't know there was four I knew that I knew that but I didn't I I keep because of there four numbers I get them all mixed up um the future of the secondary Runway uh and the master plan like a Master Plan update in general but uh Council work sessions get skitted out way in advance and if you don't jump on it now you don't get one so so we will be working to schedule a work session in the fall uh so you might as you think about that think about the timing of your letter okay would it be better to have that yes in your hands when you go to that work session I would have it submitted before the work session okay then then we can just tell the council we've scheduled a work session to address this yeah I think by then my hope is that by the July AAC meeting we'll have some direction from off on whether we need to continue to pause because part of it is they're collecting commercial a service data as well to support what we're showing as uh Aviation forecasting into the future it doesn't match up with the past of course because there was not commercial so really want to see some reality before they they send it off to headquarters so that's part of the pause the growth potential growth of the terminal campus is if it pushes East and it gets up against taxway Alpha and safety areas and things out there that impacts the other Runway so there's there's more than just the cost of maintaining the runway long term uh so we really want what we take to Council on a work session U and how we sort of direct the remaining portions of the master plan we want it to be sort of to to to be encompassing that makes sense so I think in the July meeting we'll have a little bit more direction from FAA by then and what their comfort level is with restarting the master plan and we can revisit that letter that we're going to submit to council and then at that point you know coun Council Moka is is is wonderfully engaged here so so she won't be confused as to why there's a letter coming before a decision was made but my my my worry was that if we sent this letter out and then there was nothing to tie it to it was just confused councel as to why we're ask being asked to review something they haven't seen yet you said Brad in the scope scope get more yeah my recommendation would be that we we ask a an independent firm to to look at the entire the entirety of the impacts of the second Runway and see if they concur or not with the with the findings from our consultant and and John you know that I was trying to be encouraging in the sense of getting things to us so that we could push forward in the legisl committee and you are you know you're there and so you know that there's you know there's opportunities and so that's what I was working towards is I want to see if we can get federal and state support and so having all of the in a row the timing work for that if it was in the fall then um I think so because they're not going to come back but uh you know they won't start till January okay and so I think then and if we have that information and it sounds like if people are already thinking ahead if September would be able to lead us into you know how we want to present something with our lobbyists okay okay and and it may be it could be as early as late September or as late as sometime in November before the council work session it just depends on how yeah still before January and in Courtney would be able to start working up what is needed with John's support so a lot of competing priorities with the council but now we're past budget season budget season we're not past Revenue task force right actually it's it's now completely in the council's lap the budget the budget committee is so great than uh any other I discussion on that point any other things that we need to discuss before we adjourn I feel like we've come to the end one Qui question I know can't ask this outside of the me so long ago I heard um Talk of a project for electrification so electric vehicle and electric airplane just wondering is that is that kind of Gone by the wayside is that company still around they still around that company is still around uh more and they they paused a lot of their growth because they were way out in front of themselves but charging stations that airports up and down on the west coast before they had certified by the FAA so I don't know what the status is of their certification of their aircraft but electric aircraft growth is still a thing uh but more broadly we're actually at the the final stages of a solar feasibility study at the airport as part of the master plan the Salem climate action committee uh gave us $50,000 to do a solar feasibility study so to look at what potential property would be good for solar Farms that wouldn't impact either pilot or air traffic control operations uh is there enough power to make the airport you know carbon neutral IE power you know via solar uh is there enough power to be gained to have a micro git so that a power loss we could could take care of ourselves for a period of time and then possibly even to sell some of the power back to PGE they have a mandate to have 20% of their power be renewable resources and so so all that study is almost complete now it's very highly technical you might be interested in it my high glaz over when all that stuff kilowatts and bolts different things but um should be coming back here I would say by the end of this month or sometime in June um and then at that point we'll look at you know again highest and best use of properties is do does the city want to take a portion of its available property uh and turn that into a solar farm is there enough benefit there as the payback period you know makes sense and all of that um and then um on the airport itself you you see this at Medford and some other airports where they have they take their parking lots and turn into covered parking and the covers are actually solar panels and so there's potential there for for some some of that as well as we continue to grow here at the terminal obviously if we build a new terminal we want to build some solar and some you know some renewable energy um in in an upgraded terminal it would be required it would be required yeah so so it hasn't died uh it's actually kind of taken a different course it'll probably it'll probably look different than what we anticipated because I think the aircraft certification side of it is much much slower with you know the FAA processes to certify aircraft and and and figuring out how to fight battery fires and things that fire departments really aren't used to having yet having so how about electric vehicle charging I heard was that would be that would be part of that yeah so we would but the flight deck our plan was to do aircraft on one side of the fence and then vehicle on the other side of the fence but we also want to look at it the vehicle charging probably would move ahead a lot sooner than the air right I mean that actually can be Revenue um if you have the cap you have the capital installed you can charge much higher than what you're paying for the power in fact we probably need to think about getting some electric vehicle charging spaces identified in the current Lots yes so I'm happy to chat on that if you want I I consulted with some folks on resorts on on the coast actually the former the former Herz Bild this afternoon for all the reason and I looked at that back roof that slopes towards the east and it's the Beautiful Blue Roof that slopes towards the east and I thought it would just be a perfect spot for solar panels to power that part of the airport and so I think there's a lot of potential there for for solar and and then electrical charging capacity here and over the other site as we just grow that out comparison I have airport wise is p is PX and they do have charging um and it's at a a fairly low rate so in other words the vehicle might take a few days uh if you were really low and really large capacity but it is free so doesn't have to be though you can charge I mean you can even have it open for anybody as long as they willing to pay the parking fee to stand for $10 a day yes well I know there are some facilities where you know they have different rate structures so if you want a supercharge you're going to pay more but you vehicle charge in an hour or less and I don't do super charge I mean right now since you can't since you can't return the same day or even the next day currently yeah um you could go with a level one or level two charger absolutely you don't need a level three charger yeah I can't use the level twos in Portland because I would be full LEL right before return if they had level ones I'd be all over that i' pay for it and we did talk about that as we were doing the ternal improvements things there was so much we had to get done in advance of just get",

        "text": " going to happen for several years that's okay you can incorporate it um in the next round of revisions so the cohort option that I mentioned um in this program counties can decide to work together and pull their funds in a cohort uh we don't have a minimum or maximum size requirement for that it's can be determined um by your group of counties counties who are working together in a cohort need to identify a lead County so this county is responsible for program processes and paperwork they'll receive the funds Distribution on behalf of their cohort and they'll be responsible for upholding program requirements on behalf of the cohort so as I said there is a cohort specific application um don't be intimidated by the length it really is the same as is essentially the same as the single County application we just asked for information um from each County and ask each County and the cohort to sign it once your cohort is moving forward to the performance agreement process um that will just be complete with that lead County and Odo um so if your counties choose to move forward in a cohort uh the plan the multi-count energy resilience plan that's produced needs to meet each of those content requirements for all the counties in the cohort and then all the counties in the cohort need to individually adopt those the plan and incorporate it into their natural Hazard mitigation plan as well so program resources um we have a plan development resources list that's up on our website um we try to really think through what might be some needs and put together some helpful resources for yall As you move forward in this work um there's a technical assistance provider list we've reached out to these Consultants chatted with them about their areas of expertise and they are potentially available to contract on this work there are um links and resources for meeting those mapping requirements example plans from communities across the US and Canada um none of these plans specifically meet the HB 3630 content requirements but they certainly provide great examples and inspiration of how other other communities have approached similar work and I think can be really helpful resources um there's a list of Project funding and technical assistance opportunities and this is really these are really for that um your plan is complete you're reaching out to Access Project funds and technical assistance support for more detailed Project based planning um but we wanted to have those there for you to know hey there's a lot of opportunity um for getting these projects on the ground and B they could be helpful for meeting some of those um content uh implement a Content requirement of what funding sources are out there um there's some additional resources Publications that are helpful um I think we have several folks from Energy Trust on the call and energy trust is another resource um in the Project funding and technical assistance opportunity as well as as you're going through this planning if you have questions well if Jenny's on the call actually let Jenny share because she'll do a better job of this than me Jenny are you here and available to share thanks Hannah I am here um I am having trouble with my camera so I looks like it won't be on camera but happy to happy to share and yes Energy Trust is um is a a resource to the communities who are interested in um in pursuing this grant opportunity with Odo so please do um do count us in um Hannah is there anything particular you wanted me to touch on well I was just I guess just sort of we chatted about last week so things like um context of you know energy resilience planning that's gone on best practices just y'all are just such a wealth of expertise and knowledge so um just mostly flagging that for for during planning did I speak to that correctly Jenny absolutely absolutely okay great um well thank you so much for being here too um yeah so and we'll continue to update this plan development resources list I got to get a new version up there after this webinar is we've already had some really great updates so that will be a living document that as more resources come online we'll make sure to get them up there for you um so our website is as you might imagine our program page is sort of our Clearing House for all this information one thing I haven't yet chatted about with you or I guess I briefly mentioned is we have a great comprehensive faq's document just like our plan development resources list I'll continue to update that as I get questions that I think other folks might have I'm sure some of the information will go over in a moment will be um is in there and will be on there as well so just want to flag that for you and as I said our webinar recordings will be up our first webinar slides and recording are already up and this one will be up shortly so um and there's that link to our program page um another thing to flag is that uh public utilities and Oregon are directed under HB 3630 to be a resource for counties so utilities that are in your County serving customers or operating energy infrastructure are directed to help comply with information requests you know provided it's not the information is not exempt from disclosure so just want to flag that your utilities are resource there's plenty of components of these planning um requirements and content where they might really be helpful thinking about mapping energy infrastructure or identifying um energy needs of your critical Public Services facilities and there might be some really fruitful opportunities for collaboration to meet County's needs and meet some utility needs as well and then me as I've mentioned I am here coordinating this program I'm here to be a resource for you um now when you're in the program if you have questions if you want to know if we have an expert or I can connect you to someone that can help answer some of those questions I'm I'm really just here to be a resource so I think with that we can um switch from presentation mode to question and answer and Sarah you're if you want to introduce yourself that would be great yeah hi everyone my name is Sarah murky I am the um Community Navigator so my Pro my um job is to support communities environmental justice communities in accessing federal and state resources for energy projects so as these plans um get uh created and adopted um if there are um certain components of that Pro of the plan that um you know our projects um I would be the person to step in and um and support you in navigating that I also act as very much the front door to Odo so obviously Hannah is kind of the main person for this but if there are other programs and services that Odo provides that you are interested in learning more about I'm happy to um connect you with the right person or even answer some of those um basic questions I joke that I try to know 5% of everything but know who knows 100% so um that's my job and I'm also playing MC today so I'm happy to um open it up for questions and um and then we can go from there um it looks like there's already a few questions in here Tamara um asks can you clarify adoption requirements specifically does a plan need to be adopted as an amendment to a county comprehensive land use plan if no can adoption be by resolution yeah um um my initial response and I'm looking at Max um to get his take on what I'm going to share but you know the statute doesn't say if I it never says it needs to be adopted as part of your comprehensive land use plan so I think um just that it goes through your formal County adoption process so as resolution I think would be great Max yeah um Hannah do you have the statute specifically in front of you I think it just says adopted as part of the natural hazard mitigation plan for the county is that right is that what it says specifically um counties need to adopt it via their County and incorporate it into their natural Hazard mitigation aded and incorporate I think the answer to the question then is is however the county sees fit for formally adopting it is is appropriate and so Tamar if it's by resolution or some other process then I think that would that would be appropriate absolutely agreed okay thank you and then Tamara yes we do have a list of contractors I'm going to drop that um plan development resources list in the chat right now and you'll see that the first page is that list of contractors so Alis has already beat you there so appreciate it um and I actually will be as I mentioned I'll be getting an updated version because we have a couple new um additional contractors so if you know of someone great that you've worked with um you know or you know of someone interested this is a a publicly open list so um they can just reach out to me and I can get them on the list you know they should have expertise in the area and be potentially available to help counties but other than that they can um go up on the list so and I see questions yeah I was gonna say Karen Chase is also a fantastic uh resource from Energy Trust is kind of a similar front door person um Energy Trust is awesome and has a lot of different things so she's a great resource to getting connected over there if you are not already um yeah yeah oh I'll just tag on to that that yeah we've talked about um actually once counties get enrolled in the program that I can connect you with staff at Energy Trust of Oregon if you're not already connected so that you can have that um you know initial opportunity to know that they're a resource and we're in in great dialogue to make sure that we can help youall with this planning so awesome um John you have your hand up and then we have a question in the chat as well you want to come unmute yeah thanks um I figured it be easier to unmute and ask this one I I think I understand the the the um requirements from the hb3 3630 there's there's a couple I don't uh entirely understand and um back on I think it's slide eight it says um the requirement is identify critical Public Services facilities where development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy needs what does what does that mean is that is that are we talking micro grids or can you can you maybe paraphrase that for me uh sure I don't quite quite understand um yeah that is a great question so I mean the idea behind it is when the energy grid goes down making sure that your critical Public Service facilities have an energy resource a available to provide them with power and that is I think the simplest way to phrase that it could look like",

        "text": " that any cities in Washington County will either inside or outside Metro will have the ability to access that process um so that is the the big changes in Senate Bill 1537 um and the impacts on Washington County's work House Bill 4063 did not go to ways and means it is currently waiting on the house floor for its um floor chamber vote and therefore we'll move over to the Senate side this is the bill that includes um increased responsibility for housing planning in the urban unincorporated areas within Metro they have we have talked to them about the funding issues um and the fact that they're adding work to our workload and they are working on putting together the technical assistance package in other places which we will be eligible for but it is not a guaranteed straight shot of money to us to do this work we will continue to work on that um I will say our staff in Lut worked very hard to fix the middle housing partition work so that we can actually accomplish it and has made it um um feasible for us to do the work it's not additional work it's just changing the process um and then there are recording and assessment changes that are also included that will have impacts on our work but have been agreed to and have minimal impact on those departments within um the county so those two organizations have worked really hard to represent us um in this conversation to make sure that we can do the work without additional costs so that is where house Bo 4063 is right now um given the deadlines they have to get it through the house process so they can get it scheduled on the Senate side um a couple of other bills just to to note is 1564 calls for the development of some model codes we're not sure that they'll be effective for us that it is something we have asked for because it reduces the workload if we could adopt them and Senate Bill 1530 there is significant amounts of funding included in that for homeless services and affordable housing and our goal there is to make sure that um the metro area is eligible and competitive within those programmed fundings but um we will continue to support that investment as well that is the housing update does anyone have any questions well then we'll go into the other bills that might be of interest as quickly as possible to get through it Pablo will start with you thanks so um sb541 this is the bill that would add new circuit court judges in Washington County Clackamus and Jackson counties as well um I want to take a moment just to thank chair Harrington for her testimony and support of that bill on behalf of the board um I also want to thank all the members of our local public safety coordinating Council who stepped up to submit letters of support that advocacy was well received and we've had even some some positive press coverage for it I spoke with Senator pansy who chairs that Senate Judiciary Committee and and he indicated that we're on track to get that bill passed um of course I'm still working closely with ojd um organ judicial Department to make sure that we uh continue connecting with the key decision makers that we need to get this passed out of the Ways and Means Committee um we're also seeing some uh really good support for our Courthouse project uh myself and judge guptill testified to the Capital Construction committee last Friday to advocate for that project uh representative Sosa has also made it a top priority for him as well and we're collaborating to elevate the importance of the request to the ways and means co-chairs and um the Capital Construction committee members uh moving over to forestry so um there were a few Wild fire protection funding bills that were introduced this session um that would have you know expanded or created taxes that are used to support Wildfire funding throughout the state um two of those bills did not make it through the first committee uh work session deadline so they will not be able to move forward at least in their current form um the one bill that is still alive is Senator Steiner and representative Marsh's bill um that bill would increase the Forest Products Harvest tax um which is based on the volume of timber that's harvested by Forest land owners and it's notable that a provision that was originally going to create a lot of uh trouble for our assessment of Taxation Department was was taken out um that provision would have charged $10 to each property lot in the state and that was kind of Il defined and so it would have been problematic from an implementation standpoint um but yeah I think yeah those are my my updates on forestry so we can move to pay Equity hang on one sec sure for commissioner Willie for your testimony today what uh what bill or topic is that related uh this is that was 4061 I believe it is uh house bill and it's pertaining um it's a built to to require the state Forester to put together fiveyear projections of harvest and that odf would have to comply and meet those uh because right now uh there isn't any um flower to this so odf could decide not to harvest if they decided to if they wanted to and so um they're just trying to put some parameters on it um this house bill uh did not make the cut but they've given a courtesy um spot for us today at 3 o'cl so that's what I'll be doing so this relates to all of our forestry hcp correct FMP board Direction great thank you um on the pay Equity reform what zaker has informed me is that this bill is also not moving forward it was part of our greater Workforce um Recruitment and Retention uh Concepts but there is going to be a work group over the interim where they take a comprehensive look get how pay Equity is impacting our ability to recruit and retain um so we will be working to be invited to that conversation so that we can a number of our departments would like have some interest in what happens with um uh retention and or hiring bonuses and how we evaluate P pay Equity including HR the sheriff's department HHS Lut all of them looking to recruit and retain employees um for the foreclosure process Carly hi Commissioners um the foreclosure process bill is moving which is wonderful news this bill would essentially create a Statewide template to fix unforeseen complications arising from a Supreme Court case last year uh which you're all very well aware of um yesterday we had a productive meeting with uh representative Conrad who plans to organize an informal work session in the next week and last week um the revenue committee did have a public hearing on the bill so we are tracking it closely and optimistic that um that we will see passage hopefully this session which Mr Conrad expressed a lot of optimism about where's she from uh the Benton County area um he comes from a local government perspect or perspective actually Tracy and I both worked him in a previous life um for him for us um one bill that is not on here but needs to be mentioned because it now has an amendment that is going to be of impact to uh Washington County potentially it's House Bill 4026 with the- one Amendment this uh-1 amendment is a retroactive prohibition on referrals um to the ballot for urban growth boundary expansions and this would have a direct impact on North plains as written the bill is Statewide and permanent but because it's retroactive it would include the north plain's decision to expand um what we are working to discern is what impacts that might have on our elections department where they are in the ballot creation process and if they're going to have to redo work that's already been done if this bill is to pass wait a minute how did we go from recreational immunity 26 I added in here because there's a a transition piece on recreational immunity that I was going to do so this bill was not included on the slide because we sorry I not not connected not connected added to added to the list of things that should have been on here so there's a new bill B not included on the slide 4026 D 426 the dash1 would have a um retroactive effect so it would impact the North Plains referral which means we as the elections office for that will'll have to watch and make determine if that's going to have an impact on the pre-work that our elections team has already done we're asking them right now if they've already gotten to the point where they have to undo work well ballots don't drop yet they do go to the printer give me a 30 second 45 second topic of what it is what it what's it say it basically says a city's decision to expand its Urban growth boundary cannot be referred to the ballot by any means um so is that's the main purpose for 4026 that dash one is a gutten stuff and so it become the entire purpose of the bill and we have not taken a position on the essence of the bill prior correct we are only looking at the amendment in the relationship to the impact on our elections and my my assumption but we're getting confirmation is that there should not be an impact on elections because the filing deadline isn't until mid-march so if this bill is to move forward before the end of session they haven't printed any ballots yet um or put the materials together on a side note could I ask you what Lo's position is on this um my understanding and I can confirm I will double triple check at this point but the league of Oregon cities does support this effort it is a Statewide initiative um related to all Urban growth boundaries and expansions in the future and in the last year that was just informational so on recreational immunity um tracing are tag teaming this um because it does have impacts on both the county and um Cain water services and our ability to provide access to Trails and parks and therefore is um a an important issue to both of our agencies um as we allow people to come into our recreational spaces um as it sits right now there we are comfortable from the perspective of the county that we are included in the the protections but they are temporary um in nature they are adding particular activities to the list of presumptive recreation to include walking and biking um and running which is things that we do on trails that is um and so the presumption that it is Recreation means that it is um covered by recreational immunity that this bill comes from the issue that arose after Newport had someone walking across a bridge slipped B injured themselves and the court determined that they",

        "text": " what was said uh well i guess i would just highlight uh that you know marion county is doing a great job you know that 25 we've been saying a rebuilding rate i mean that's across the state and if marion county you know we've talked to marion county before we've certainly recognized that that rebuilding rate has been uh much speedier there and so just kudos to the county and all the support staff to get that people get those permits rolling and help people rebuild as much as they can i know that's a challenge across the state so that's that's awesome that you're already at 41 um and getting everything to uh rebuild it to uh current code i mean uh we certainly recognize that that you know the majority of people are going to be rebuilt to that that rate and uh and certainly we we recognize that um there's opportunity there uh for you know maybe the opportunity's a little bit smaller there's not that many people that would be rebuilding to a current code but we still want to look at this as economic recovery and we still think there's an opportunity to help people um get there and so yeah if we can get people to even incentivize them to build a little bit above code that's great um but uh but we accept that there's gonna be the reality is you know some people would probably already built the code but so maybe we can just help them offset some of those additional costs maybe they didn't anticipate lumber being so expensive for all these other materials that have certainly gone up how can we help people as best we can thank you for your thoughts chris yeah thank you so much so while folks are thinking if they have any other answers or any other questions i will ask one that we really find important to ask for folks that are on the ground in these areas that we are um working to working to provide the incentive and the question is actually number six we're just wondering thoughts on how we can best engage survivors to ensure they know the program is available as they rebuild we want to make sure everyone is just aware of this chance and so any wisdom that anyone can share for how best they have connected with folks would be really helpful and if you raise your hand we can unmute you and and hear how you think we ought best reach out oh it's chris again thanks chris well i meet you and there you go you should be able to talk now i could talk on these topics all day long because i do on every single day so right now this is just my personal um personal input until there's really a program developed here at marion county we're not necessarily advertising these programs at this point in time because we don't know the answers to everything and how the process is going to work what the incentives are so i think the key thing for us to start advocating this to the public is we need to have a better idea understanding what is available um from a marion county standpoint at this stage um it's kind of hard to answer questions when i don't know the answers to them so that's kind of just my two sense of where we're at at this point in time once once we get something that's developed in we can start giving some you know it really starts at the the permitting process advocating you know to other groups we have some sit team long-term recovery groups that can you get the information out there things like that and then just try to figure out if there's a retroactive process how we how we engage that to the people i've already constructed and and get that um but yeah like go ahead i was going to say those are really good points and once we do have the program finalized and have those materials ready we'll make sure that you get them and maybe we can work together on getting them out to the right people and on reaching out to people that are part of that 41 percent so yeah that's that's just the biggest struggle we have right now of trying to get this out there and advertise is we just don't know what is all involved to be accurate and we don't want to be misleading yeah fair enough we don't want you advertising it yet either because we're not ready for folks to apply and that just be really frustrating so we're working to get get that all put together and the point of today is to just have that conversation to make sure that what we're putting together looks right um sounds right to people and any good answers to these questions that we have so that we can have a program designed that we know um has been tested uh with the people that are doing the work on the ground so thanks for being here today chris i'll do ahead michael and then mcrae we'll get you off meet you in a second oh sorry uh so chris i just wanted to i was kind of curious you mentioned uh kind of doing that outreach and getting that message out have you had i guess what communication channels have you found successful in working with these communities or any kind of insight you give to us on what materials you think have been more more successful as far as just educating people about programs or services available and what kind of communication channels have you found most successful i think somebody might have put chris back on mute so he couldn't answer so could we have chris off mute again please sorry about that chris um well while we're figuring out how to get chris off mute we do want to hear how you've reached out successfully and we'll get back but mcrae is off you can go ahead i was going to offer um in concert with chris um you know a comprehensive clear communication of what what the program is you know and and how what people do um i think if we could be sharing information now that about the rule making and that this is coming and we have city council tonight at detroit so i might um just uh bring it up and mention it that this is happening and that we'll be seeing stuff coming next year but i think um to answer the point very directly like uh single sheets uh flyers um you know with the website and i don't know if this is the question you're asking but but very simplified um and i think our websites um marion counties cox city of uh detroit city of gates um just newly has a website they didn't have a website before their um social media channels i mean this obviously this is broader my i'm sorry my focus is just gates in detroit mailers too to all property owners uh we're going to be doing we have some information we need property owners to know about um and we'll be sending out materials this within the next few weeks so i just think um the point being multiple uh ways like people are coming come to finding information in lots of forms and we and and we have more formats so and i'm ready to share as is chris and others once once it's formed we'll help get it out there to people great thank you so much and chris we we solved that problem and you can answer too if there's other specific thoughts you want to add to mcrae's on how you're best reaching yeah i mean right now our best line of communication um is we we have a group it's our long-term recovery group through marion county they're kind of spearheading the recovery efforts long-term short-term so we have a pretty pretty good group that's kind of doing that i can get some contacts for you guys if you'd be interested because i know they're our board of commissioners and also these groups are interested in these incentive programs so they would be be good to be part of yeah like mccray says uh single sheet on our web page we have a well uh well fire recovery web page that we have um my direct line is always a good source for any questions that people may have too once we know more of this program i'll be a lot more helpful but yeah it's just and through the grapevines just trying to get everybody aware of these programs i do have a question that just popped my mind about the funding of this how does this funding play a role if this if these rebuilds are going through a lending agency versus out of pocket cost is there i mean because that's ultimately those funds are coming from lending agency versus the physical person i'm just kind of curious how that how that would play out in the long term yeah you're leaning forward i thought you had it go ahead um yes so that's a great question and so uh we are focused on uh the incentives tying to the the property owner and so we were designing our program or thinking in terms of designing a program that they would go to to the building owner directly and be cutting them a check whether it came from the state agency or whether it came from the county that would go directly to the but we certainly welcome feedback if you feel like there's a different way to do that or you've got to you've seen other programs or other models work successfully uh to work with the financing industry or other groups we could certainly take a look at that i know in uh other programs we've run we've done programs where incentives go directly to the contractor that's working on it made through a solar program or something else but at this point we were focused on trying to get the money directly to the people because we thought that would be the most helpful uh and we'd received some feedback that that was the best way to do it uh but we're certainly open to uh to ideas or people have feedback or or seen a better way to do it please let us know yeah the reason i bring that up is because we run into that with refunding permits when a general contractor applies for the permits pays for them requests a refund and then the question is is how does that money ultimately get back to the property owner that paid for that so it's just kind of the same thing on a lending agency side i'd imagine they'd they'd want their money back if they're lending money to a property owner we're paying or there's money going back to the property but not getting back to the agency it's just a thought maybe there's no grounds or even a worry about it just it's just kind of no i think that's an important thing to flag and that uh one i mean just you're talking about kind of the general contractor aspect of of them paying permits if we had a general contract or submitting permits and filling out an which we'd love for them to",

        "text": " but there there is a you know you asked the question hasn't even failed to make 15 years and the answer is no but there is a recapture provision in here that should they not make that 15 year and they say all that to pay it so we're kind of covering both sides of that base um but what I heard them describing is it's all within the confines of this agreement not the direct and the indirect property tax generation because employees live in the county blah blah so I I was thinking about trying to help our community members understand what it is we're at yeah and they're I mean because they have to make it a minimum investment and pay taxes on a subset of that investment it's almost guaranteed that this will be unless they fail in which case we recapture any discounts thank you uh moving on to number five uh so number five is another place where we've had substantial changes uh to the language used here um and the changes that are made are really to focus on the full ecosystem of uh businesses uh within the county and to think about the expectation that companies that receive the Sip incentive um look to intentionally support other local small businesses uh with a strong focus of those that have been left at or kept out of opportunity in the past and we'll say that um the language used here also aligns with some of the County's work led by procurement around Supplier Diversity so we're really excited about this one I was just going to ask if if it did line up and because I don't remember hearing it quite like this but it was I I don't remember hearing the uh facing discriminatory barriers previously I've heard bypac minority owned businesses and just to jump on board that exactly where I was going with this I don't read in our procurement verbiage I don't I don't remember seeing that in there but so yeah I'd just like it was great yeah great thanks yeah well now also located in the metropolitan area versus located within the county and in the marketplace could you enlighten me a little bit more um yes I think um uh you know Marketplace refers really um the supply chain for these companies um rather than a specific uh geography um and so it is you know we're focused on uh let's see I'm just gonna read it encourage the amount of goods the services purchased from businesses located within the county and specifically from businesses owned by individuals that have faced discriminatory barriers to participation in the marketplace so the marketplace support within the county it is yeah but changing it to support within the county as well why Why move from metropolitan area to only Washington county is my question um you know I I think uh just to focus in on uh on on local businesses within the county we'd be happy to change it to metropolitan area as well that is how the supply chains work you know there are companies across the metropolitan area out there I can tell you if Multnomah County wrote something like this and said I would react I uh more comfortable with a wider variable okay okay and maybe they would say only in both moment and maybe every other SIM program does say only within the county I just wasn't sure what led you to narrow it that's all sure uh we we do want to be a good uh Regional Partners don't we so I think we can use more inclusive language here across metropolitan area I I appreciated this but the pity in this um I when I think about the metropolitan area I think about the Troy County and I think of this to be in a more specific to Washington County this you know Washington County I appreciated the spec like how specific this was and how you sort of narrowed down that the focus is Washington County uh I also had the same reaction uh um while I appreciated number five the more specific to Washington County question number three you changed it to local economy so there's a descript like and I forgot to mention it when I was speaking earlier it seemed a bit of we whiten it you took out the county county-wide economic base and you change it to local economy and when I think about local economy I think about the metropolitan area or oh boy so we're we're struggling here so I think for me I I wanted to know more of your thinking by number three you changed it from local economy as you're supposed to count wide uh sure yeah number three and it sounds like the feedback that I'm hearing is that we could uh do better to do a review of consistent language throughout all of these um so so that's something that we can go back and do to make sure that we're working being consistent whether we're talking about local or the county or the metropolitan area oh and when is local County and when is local bigger we will look at making that more consistent to directly answer your question uh commissioner fi in number um the reference to local economy there is really thinking about smaller um and um uh making sure that um they are again kind of intentionally being tied into these investments in Washington County local businesses in Washington in in Washington County yes yeah yeah yeah I not you can't focus just on Washington counties uh I was really just trying to understand the nature of the change so well the reality is we're the one giving up yes property taxes so you know we can be a little piggy about it speaking that way but also if you're remembering you I'm sure that you've seen this chair many years ago Intel put together Stratosphere of their influence in the region and their sphere of influence stretched well beyond the metropolitan area it was Salem it was up the gorge it was up north in Washington it was huge and so we can put all the verbiage we want into in here but when they have that kind of influence and a company that's going to invest a billion or two or five billion they're going to have that same sphere of influence no matter what our little agreement here says Buy they're gonna they're gonna have a much larger footprint yeah great well thank you I appreciate the discussion and again it sounds like we should go back and take a look at how we're kind of talking about uh impacts and geography it's also yeah uh it's also into oh I'm sorry I continue to struggle with how do we meet or speak address the Skeptics right that's what I was really getting at earlier I'm really struggling with that what are the Skeptics Washington County Skeptics or are they Regional Skeptics or Statewide Skeptics I mean because I know there are Skeptics here Washington county-wide and so I'm just trying to address that and I also with all due respect yeah there will always Bingo absolutely you know and and I don't know that this probably helps they don't know that it solves but it helps and I also want to call out that we talk about encouraging the amount of goods not restricting it so that's a you know I so I'm I'm it's a blend of the pragmatic versus um the outcomes we hope to see is to grow an entire ecosystem matinee when I talked to the legislature it's about the ecosystem and sometimes that ecosystem is within the county and sometimes it's within the region and sometimes it's across the state because um I think what we've seen both from the echo Northwest information that they've provided but also the information that Intel talks about what what the Investments here have done um it's probably going to be impossible to spend all their you know lower developers money in Washington County but they're gonna they spend a lot of it and it brings those Industries into the county which produced more value to meet number four but also Economic Opportunity for Workforce getting into these jobs that become part of that Supply economy and if we want to be a little selfish I think sometimes when it's our dollars on the line the community needs to see that we want that reinvestment back here in Oklahoma County and that other counties will respect that as well I'm sure they'll go for their gold as well thank you Aaron moving to number six uh small change with number six number six had talked about in the 2006 policy meeting land use transportation and neighborhood design objectives we inserted the word policy there policy and design it's not just about the design of these things but also the policies whether it's the land use Transportation has uh that the county has through the induced in transportation and other things there so I want to make sure that's aligned and this is where I think about all the trucks that through 2019 and earlier were coming down First Avenue here with from the Intel site and policy and design objectives aside it's not like that road's been improved it's definitely alligatored and I don't know number six yeah we've used the Sip to pay to subsidize the uua portion of Lut Ely county-wide resource to subsidize the uuas that's what number six means to anytime we anytime a company decides to build a new facility and let's just pretend it's not a Ronler Acres let's pretend it's out in some of the new space there's going to be a significant for Road improvements infrastructure all those kinds of things that's what I would say that's their contribution is and it's improving their immediate area that they do have impact on transportation and all those kinds of so we're already asking them actually not probably not asking them we're already mandating those kinds of policies onto their project and so I don't know what this is so good this is comment isn't a beef or a skeptic it's gotten harder to see that information I had to seek our CAO offices copy of the assessment and Taxation report because we as Commissioners are no longer provided a hard copy to see that in fact the property tax rolls do increase by that very same example you've provided it's gotten harder for me as a commissioner to get access to that information is that because that's a city approved project versus uh or Lut because we've made it harder for us to easily get the information because I couldn't find that on our website which is an internal problem but it just makes it harder to see the value that he's talking about I mean I don't think number six refers necessarily to that it sounds to me like this is kind of an ongoing we may come back around in a couple years and say Hey you know that road that almost connects up to where you're going you know we'd kind of like you to improve that road too um this seems like it's it's an ongoing ask potentially for 15 years and I don't I don't know I don't quite understand what this is I don't think it's something we've actually used so in in looking",

standards that are required by the underlying goals then these other questions are Moot and and I don't see any reason to decide based on each exception in that case thank you councilmember Condon uh thank you and I concur with the counselors who have spoken so far I can't make this can't can't get there for the exceptions so thank you so uh for the record this is Marcy Grail I um as I stated you know I have things that that I question but I do want to be clear you have council members who are representing uh all over parts of Oregon I think we all take our responsibilities really seriously I've I'm a very literal person I've read documents and I can't get past what I've read I've listened um it's compelling uh arguments but I agree with uh the rest of the council thank you uh Jordan had to step away I don't believe he is with us now thanks for reminding but the last text I got he had popped away just confirming so I can make the note so for all of the group three exceptions um you're essentially going with number one you agree with the hearing officers findings and conclusions in the proposed contest case or I'll make note of that so I think at this time we can uh go to the next slide um and this is the proposed Order review at which point I've handed back to Department staff so it is 12 17 we can either have Kate come up and go through the the last kind of portion of this or we can take a break and get lunch and come back just depends on what the council wants to do how are you all feeling is that here take a break I've heard take a break you have uh sandwiches um we did do this as a working lunch so you know in time to grab sandwiches eat a bit but you know feel free also to be eating uh while Kate is presenting the next one so however much time you want to take to do that um is your choice recommendations on time 10 15 10 or 15. what's your pleasure let's go with 15 and we could take a take a minute so the time is now 12 18. oh goodness uh so if we could come back at 12 33 that would be great thank you all right thank you uh the time is now 12 33 and we are going to resume our meeting we have Kate Sloan back ready to continue on Kate the floor is yours thank you chair Grail and Council for the record this is Kathleen Sloan senior siting analyst for Department of energy and I am resuming our review of the proposed order of the Nolan Hills wind for site certificate so we're on agenda item 1B and I'm going to pick up the review of the proposed order under the land use with a couple of caveats next slide in the comments received from Council on the draft proposed order we had two issues identified one was the goal three exception for the solar facility it's more than 12 acres and in efu exclusive Farm you Zone and item number two was the Umatilla County two mile setback which was the subject of contested case and Council has just reviewed all of that so I'm not going to cover that topic in my presentation I will just focus on the goal 3 exception as this was not the subject of the contested case next slide so just um as a refresher the proposed facility would be up would include up to eighteen hundred and ninety six acres for a solar PV ODU Baltic energy generation components a battery storage system an Associated um the solar components would impact over 12 acres of high value and arable farmland and for that reason required the council take an exception to the Statewide policy embodied in goal three for agricultural lands in order to be cited in the proposed location so this was part of the request to hold the record open enduring council's review in May of 2022 and the applicant submitted additional information on June 15th and Council reviewed that information when they resume their review of the DPO on June 24th of 2022. and in the draft proposed order the department had recommended that under the reasons exception which is tends to be what the goal three exception falls under in our process that the applicant had met two reasons one being minimal add minimal impacts to Agriculture and the other one was local economic benefit however we did have Council comments received that question um whether or not there had been enough evidence in the record to support a third reason which was locational dependency and that is the basis of the additional information that the applicant submitted in 2022 and also the basis for additional findings of fact that we included in the proposed in the proposed order we proposed additional findings of fact the department oops next slide please I don't want to get too far ahead okay so this map here shows the the fact that it's all an exclusive Farm and then the goal three exception area is that yellow area included in the smaller map on the right which is the footprint of the solar facility next slide please So based upon the comment that we received and also the additional information submitted by the applicant we did as a department make some changes from the draft proposed order in the proposed order to add additional findings of fact to support locational dependency as another reason for the goal three exception and in or based upon that information there's a couple of things that we incorporated into a new recommended condition next slide and it really has to come down to the uh the fact that the solar facility the proposed solar facility that requires the goal exception is in close proximity to both roads and other infrastructure that would um support a finding that this location for the solar facility was cited and selected in support of the the wind components and one of the comments that came from Council had to do with wanting that if if the goal exception was approved that the wind components would be constructed as well and it wasn't a way to get the solar facility approved and so how the department recommended we achieved that is really in subpart B of this new recommended condition which is on the next slide which basically requires the certificate holder if Council approved the goal three to demonstrate that it would construct what we estimated to be a minimum of 50 megawatts of a turbine string and it's the 16 turbines I believe that we're in closest proximity to the area that needed the goal exception so in this subpart B it says if commencement of wind energy generation components will occur more than 12 months after solar energy generation components certificate holders shall submit to council for review at a regular scheduled council meeting facility design documents and executed contracts example given Construction contract power purchase agreement or other evidence that demonstrates to council satisfaction that the turbine strings with a minimum of 50 megawatt generation capacity will be constructed in close proximity to the solar site and that the wind and solar facility components will share the northern project substation in any existing roads during construction and operation prior to construction completion deadlines and this was additional information provided by the applicant and in response to comments made by Council So based upon that new recommended um we felt that in our proposed order we we made that new finding effect we supported it with a with a new proposed condition that we just reviewed um and feel that that satisfied Council comments and demonstrated that the facility could also add that third reason to the other two reasons that Council had accepted as as being met for the goal three exception so at this point I believe we're back at the straw poll or discussion but looks like Cindy might have a comment or a question and then uh thank you so um I'd like the addition of of this um I just had a hard time uh putting together how this how this is work it's pre-construction and so there's some thought that okay we're gonna add wind later after 12 and so can you kind of go through how the timing would work like in the 11th when when is the is the presentation at a regularly scheduled council meeting could it be five years five years from a date I'm I was uh not certain that construction absolutely would be done or could they could it just be kept well if we go if you go back one more slide Nancy I think maybe the opening language of this condition might satisfy your question I'm not sure that it will but um at the okay it's being Pokey okay so that kind of preamble to the part A and Part B I think my answer your question because it does say prior to construction of the solar components the certificate holder shall document that the turbine strings it will be constructed so I think what the way we framed it was it is conditional that they both have to happen now whether one gets built before the other I thought that there might be some more flexibility in the timing of the construction schedule but prior to construction of any solar component they have to demonstrate that they're prepared to construct these 16 turbines at a three megawatt capacity not to exceed this 50 so if I can follow up on that so um given that there's no time constraint um could the could the applicant um submit something that said yes we're going to have this facility and it will be 15 years out or is there it just wasn't clear to me that there's a timing constraint for construction and that when do you have a power purchase agreement or the evidence that it that for the wind component does that make sense now I understand your question I'm not sure I'm gonna let Sarah jump in here and help me out um this is Sarah esterson senior policy advisor for the citing division um so uh council is obligated to establish construction commencement deadlines for the facility and a completion deadline so they and I don't know do you have the ability to go I don't want to throw you off I can find it I wanted to verify what their time frame is but traditionally it's you have three years from the start and then three more years to finish so the time frame of this condition is within that window as a start but it's still a pre-con",

        "text": " of is this the right plan is this the right path for the project to be taking but ultimately we're proving the the primary path that um that the utility is seeking f sec my understanding you guys could potentially approve um multiple paths um if a decided ultimately that um even though they've started this process concurrently between say fsec and the poc if they decide that they should change the route f-sec approved multiple routes or a different route um that would potentially require them to come back and revise their submission and potentially completely resubmit it um with the puc in order to get the the cpcn for the route that they are actually deciding to move forward on to the next slide um but so the one thing that we've heard and that we're still trying to iron out um is the issue of that kind of scenario five scenario six where the public utility commission is making a land use determination we don't really want to do that we don't that's not our core expertise at the puc um we uh and likewise uh we've heard from a number of other parties including a number of they don't want us to preempt their authority on these things um we don't want to do that either and so we've kind of gravitated towards this idea of using land use compatibility statements or luxes there was a lot of discussion about that at a meeting this past month and we're still kind of ironing that out but it's something that department environment quality department of land conservation and development both use um in a number of cases and this would allow us to be able to check in with those local counties uh as to whether they think that um that a particular project is going to to meet their local land use um goals and will be a permittable project and it's that that's kind of a provisional determination by by the local government um that they could subsequently change which is where the puc lawyers are having a little bit of heartburn about but hopefully we'll get it across that line here um we're intending to have these revised rules done um by in the late summer very early fall time period uh because we do see an important uh cpcn petition likely to be coming um in the near future um and so we want to have these rules the revised rules in place ahead of that fairly consequential so that that process can be as smooth and as efficient as possible so with that uh we can go on to the next slide which is just say if you have any do my best to try and answer them thank you are there any questions for mr thank you i think it's interesting i do spend a lot of time paying attention to what happened to the puc in my paid job and i think there are some interesting things that uh spill over so we will be paying close attention to see how this plays out well actually i do have a question go ahead cindy um thank you so i'm curious um the terms i think on the cpcn are 10 years and 15 year 10 years if no construction is started and 15 if construction is started so when they reach those uh time frames is there a renewal process that's an interesting question um potentially i suppose they could i'm not sure it would be so much renewal as it would be just a resubmission but in all likelihood if they were to reach those lengths uh something has changed with with the utility and their plans um i know there's been a lot of talk about that 10-year timeline if they haven't built anything in that time because at that point um the original land owner who had their land condemned has a right to repurchase that land um so i think that would present um a complicating factor but uh i i would say that it's always a possibility it just see it's probably very unlikely that you would see some cpcn uh persist for that long without the project either being completed or being scrapped and utility going a different direction with their their plans for how to address their transmission needs thank you additional questions comments bro this is kent and i just say there was reference to the land use compatibility statements and i'm a little fuzzy on whether that was going to be determined at the local level by the counties or whether the puc might be making some of those and i'm wondering i have a feeling i remember when i was working at the county those ladies compatibility statements could be appealed somebody make an argument it's a land-use and would the puc then if they'd made that land use compatibility determination be something that the puc would be taking to luba so um that is exactly the area that our lawyers are having a bit of heartburn about which is what happens if okay so we get uh affirmative lux from from a county they've given us the kind of provisional thumbs up about a project but then it gets appealed um at that local level and it gets reversed you know what happens either you know have we wrapped up our own cpcn process um you know what happens with that reversal if we haven't wrapped it up what happens if we have wrapped up our cpcn process and granted a certificate um to a project um if there's that um my own personal opinions are like well that's not really our problem but uh that uh but that is uh something that our lawyers are um trying to figure out what that looks like do we revoke a cpcn an element of that was kind of the foundation for part of its approval got or do we just want to grant ourselves the flexibility around having that be something that is determined on a case-by-case basis um that is kind of to be determined over the next couple of months i would say well again thank you for joining us especially on a friday before holiday weekend have a safe holiday and thank okay thank you very much all right well that concludes agenda item f we are ahead of schedule todd i'm looking at you now madam chair looks like lunch is not quite here yet i know nancy's probably gone up to get it so your choice are to either break now for lunch and i think lunch will be down pretty quickly or you can just keep rolling we have one more agenda item since the last agenda item had to be continued so you can kind of keep rolling through the next one and then we could just conclude the meeting and then you know people can choose to either eat here or grab lunch and hit the road what would you all like to do and get started christopher does that work for you cheer girl yes i i'm uh prepared to move forward and if you all need to stop and grab some food um just let me know okay i think that sounds like a great then our next agenda item is agenda item g g which is wildfire prevention and response rulemaking this is consideration of proposed rules which is an action item we have christopher m clark senior citing analyst and f-sec rules coordinator chris will you please get started i thank you chair grill i members of the council once again for the record my name is christopher clark i am the council's rules coordinator today uh like in the last uh agenda item e uh the council will be considering whether or not to move forward with uh formal proceedings to adopt a new and that standard would be for uh wildfire risk prevention and mitigation at energy facility sites uh before i turn things over to the council to discuss uh whether or not to move forward with the proposed rules i'll be providing background and procedural history on this project i'll give you an overview of our recommendations uh which are uh reflected in the draft notice of proposed rulemaking um that i believe is actually included as attachment to to the staff report and uh i'll be giving the timeline for our recommended conduct of the formal and i want to say that it was a a little bit serendipitous that mr martin was able to present on the cpcn rules today because this this agenda item also has a lot to do with uh some rule making that's currently being conducted by the public utility commission and um just i wanted to thank mr martin again for being here and for a great presentation so um to give some overview of the uh context of wildfire policy in oregon uh as it stands now after several pretty severe fire seasons uh both in oregon and in the west uh the governor established the council on wildfire response back in 2019. um that council made several recommendations including that oregon ensure that its electrical utilities implement best practice risk mitigation strategies to reduce human-caused um and particularly ignitions caused by transmission lines which have been a big uh source of wildfire um in oregon and in california uh executive order 2004 which we know as the executive order that directed uh several state agencies to take actions to address climate change also included some provisions directing the public utility commission to undertake rulemaking to under uh to implement the governor's council on wildfire response um the puc opened a rulemaking for that purpose in 2020 and then in 2021 the legislature also passed senate bill 762 which established new standards for electric utility wildfire protection plans created some requirements for the department of forestry to provide statewide risk analysis for wildfire uh and also um included several new programs to mitigate um both the health and uh safety impacts of wildfire um in in the state um our our rulemaking here today is really focused on that first part which is is related to the new standards for electric utility wildfire protection plans and that's what the puc rule making is focused on as well the puc completed the first phase of that rulemaking in december of last year and uh then um and that established the minimum kind of requirements for the first round of wildfire protection plans from electric utilities uh all three investor-owned electric utilities uh submitted their initial wildfire protection plans to the puc in december and those all three plans were subsequently approved by the puc in the council initiated this rule making as part of its 2021 to 2023 rulemaking kind of tracking some of the same issues that that prompted the puc rule making when you put this on the schedule you directed staff to prioritize the project while also monitoring the progress of the puc rule making to ensure that we adopt any conflicting so kind of tracking the puc rule making the council initiated it's rule-making in october of last year in january we sent out letters requesting input from tribal governments and also conducted a rulemaking",

on draft order draft proposed order on request for a site certificate Amendment Kellen tardy weather will provide a senior signing analyst will provide a facility overview I will act as the presiding officer over the public hearing and then the public hearing we will following this brief introduction of the agenda item this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line site certificate I can't Howe energy facility citing Council Vice chair and serving as the presiding for this hearing hold on just a second uh restart now Pickett um today is July 17 2023 the time is now 5 35 this public hearing is being held at an energy facility citing council meeting in person at the Best Western Sunridge hotel conference room in Baker City Oregon this hearing is also being held via a WebEx webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar weather senior citing Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy will provide an overview of the amendment process and changes proposed in the amendment request missed harder weather you have the floor thank you Vice chair how oh my gosh my voice is so loud there we go um for the record Kell and tardy weather senior citing analyst Oregon Department of energy I am I have Nancy in the back of the room for those of you who are online and calling in thank you for attending um she's going to be running my presentation so if there's a little bit of pauses or if we go back and forth with the slides just bear with us I may or may not have forgotten my computer back at the office everything's fine several as a vice chair introduced I'm going to be um leading off um the information item with a project overview and then we're going to transition into the uh first of two hearings on the request for Amendment one and the draft proposed order on request for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line um next slide Nancy so this is an overview of uh what this evening is going to look like um and for those of you online we have we have we have some folks here in the room we have some members of the public and the agency but um people may be filtering in here um and then when we get to the hearing portion we'll kind of see um who's interested in commenting and then a lot time from that portion um but really this part of my presentation should be should be pretty quick I'm going to do a facility overview which includes just a summary of the approved facility and then a summary of what request for Amendment one is um I'm going to provide an overview or the vice chair how is going to provide an overview of the hearing um Vice chair how and I are going to say a lot of similar things um and and for those of you who participate in the process there'll be familiar words but they are very important that's why we go over them a couple times um then we'll get to the hearing um where the certificate whole older Idaho Power will be provided an opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order members of the public will be provided an opportunity to provide oral comments and Council will be provided an opportunity to ask any clarifying questions of the certificate holder and then lastly the certificate holder will have an opportunity to respond to anything raised this evening um the written comment period also is still open which I'll um next slide please Nancy which I'll I will comment on those options that exist for people to comment so just real quick for those who may be new to the citing process Nancy can you click one more time the energy facility signing Council fsec or the council provides is provides a Consolidated review and oversight for large scale or utility scale energy facilities across Oregon um the council is made up of a seven person Governor appointed and Senate regulatory body who's the decision maker on these large energy projects in Oregon the council members come from all over Oregon and come from a wide array of backgrounds and serve terms so for folks who track with Council processes uh projects they see the council members change over time myself and other other my colleagues in the citing division at the Oregon Department of energy serve as staff to the council so we do like technical legal review project management and do things like we're doing here tonight next slide please and then one more click so this is our and uh in the room this is a little bit hard to uh hard to read the screen's a little bit small but but folks are kind of used to seeing our process Chevron this very much mirrors the same processes for an application for site certificate all applications and amendments originally are submitted in a preliminary State and they go through a completeness review where there's information requests sent to a certificate holder they provide responses this back and forth goes on until the department determined determines that the information in the amendment is sufficient for the Department to draft findings and conditions of compliance in a draft proposed order um and then when we deem the amendment complete um we then use that information um to draft findings and recommendations in the draft proposed order we issue um stems a comment period and then there's in-person hearings which leads us here and then the next steps after our we would issue and I will go over um more in my presentation of the next steps but folks for folks who are new to the process one of the things we really like to highlight is this is obviously where the red Chevron we're in the middle so we're not towards the end there's still more steps to go next slide please okay so the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line is an approved um Council uh approved uh the final order and issued the site certificate last September so we're just under a year here um from that Blast from a past um and um so the facility again the map is kind of small it includes approximately 273 miles of mostly 550 kilovolt transmission line through five counties in Oregon there are several alternative routes that are also approved and then there are rebuilds of some segments of the line that are included in the approval as related or supporting facilities that are approved and include multi-use areas which are like temporary construction um 299 polling and tensioning sites 10 communication stations and then two communication stations associated with the Morgan Lake alternative um and then another important related or supporting facility you know particularly as it applies to Amendment one are our roads so access roads which can be temporary access roads or permanent access roads um but roads are related approved related or supporting facility to the transmission line next slide please so what are we looking at in requests for Amendment one so similar to how Idaho Power originally proposed in the application and what council approved Idaho Power what council approved is was the approved route and then Alternatives which gave gives Idaho Power if they're approved the flexibility to choose one or the other ultimately when they build when in final facility design and build out the here as represented in request for Amendment one as Idaho Power works with landowners and gains access to do surveys and landowner negotiations a lot of that has necessitated moving some roads or routes around properties um which If It Moves outside of what was that previously approved site boundary that means they have to add that area and through an amendment process and so how Idaho Power has framed it in a request for Amendment one is just adding more options so these are functionally adding more areas and ultimately they will be able to pick from anything that is approved if these are approved so rfa1 includes uh",

so let's see so tonight uh I'm going to talk about the uh related project categories that were included in the bond without specific locations so we often refer to these as buckets just for shorthand because it's sort of hard to describe otherwise um just as a reminder those are listed up on the slide the safer pedestrian Crossings category sidewalk replacement category and a sidewalk infill uh I'm going to talk about the recommended process and criteria to select project locations that we have been working on or the bond committee has been working on over the last several months talk a bit about Equity um since that can mean many different things and then finally um finish with a recommendation to allocate a portion of the side Sidewalk replacement funds to be delivered with near-term Paving projects so to start with the uh recommended process to select locations this is outlined in your staff report um what the bond committee is recommending is that we start with seeking public input um on where they think important locations are now we need to recognize and we do recognize that we've already heard from the public in many different areas in terms of the sidewalk repairs and Replacements that Brandon was referring to also pedestrian Crossings so we will share what we've already heard as we go out and make sure that more people hopefully know that they can make their requests and not maybe just the people who already know the system um then those locations will be evaluated against criteria that I'll be talking about next um in criteria are very important because the need does vastly exceed the amount of funds that are available even through these um you know these buckets that we very much appreciate and are great but they're not going to cover everything uh we will work with staff to develop engineering staff to develop cost estimates to for projects to address the top ranking locations and then work with the bond committee to develop preliminary recommendations for each one of these buckets those recommendations will take into consideration factors outside of the criteria such as um the overall cost of projects we don't want to have maybe a top ranking project that costs 8 million take the entire bucket so those factors will be brought together then we will seek public input on the preliminary recommendation before the bond committee finalizes their recommendation and brings it to comes forth to city council for approval we estimate that the process is going to take between 1 and 2 years to get through I know that sounds like a long time but it really depends on the number of requests we get and the complexity of them so um but after that we'll be delivering the projects so this slide shows the a recommended criteria I know it's a little hard to read on the screen that is also in your um staff report um each category each bucket has slightly different category reflecting the needs of that program uh we tried to keep as much Sim similarity as we could um for example Equity is in all of those and I'll talk more about that in a second um Street classification proximity to things like schools Parks Transit uh pedestrian Crossing one has some um separate criteria in terms of distance to the nearest Crossing as well as pedestrian crashes and then the sidewalk replacement category we um have a pretty strong emphasis on that Hazard that hazard assessment that uh Brandon's group has already developed okay so I said I talk a little bit more about Equity what do we mean by equity in this particular case so we're really talking about need-based Equity so that's not the same as equality right it's it's Equity based on need and we've developed a equity scoring tool for use in this um it's based on eight categories from the US Census it's the best available data on this at a census tract level you can see the categories listed on the screen uh these categories align with ones that are used by the Salem Kaiser Metropolitan planning organization this also mirrors what was uh approved by City Council in the neighborhood traffic plan so this map here um I know you can't see the details um but you can look sort of at the colors so this shows all the census tracks with located within the city limits they are shaded to reflect where they fall in terms of the um in terms of an equity score using a score between 0 and 25 since it's going to be 25 out out of 100 points the census tracks with the highest scores are the darkest purple on this map the ones with the lowest scores are the sort of yellowish white gray ones um I have on on this map we have overlaid the ward boundaries in red just to help people get sort of oriented to the geography now this tool isn't sort of the only way that we think about Equity it's important to note that we also will be doing Outreach to uh traditionally underserved communities including working with the city's new Equity round table so then as an as an example we took um all of the uh sidewalk replacement repair complaints that Brandon has on his system and we scored them through these criteria using that Equity as 25% and what this map shows you can't really see any specific dots but you can tell where the dots are sort of that darker red or orange color so mostly in the north Northeast area um those are ones that have the highest score in this criteria the dark blue light blue are the ones with the the lowest scores now we will be doing Outreach to get more dots on this map or lines or whatever so this won't be the universe but in this particular example um with the funding we have available it would likely go to the ones that are in that darker red or darker Orange um colors so then switching to the recommendation to allocate funds for near-term Paving projects this is part of our staff recommendation because the process to um choose these projects is going to take some time our engineers looked at the near-term paving projects particularly those slated for 2024 and 2025 to see if there were any um obvious uh needs that could be partnered with those Paving projects to increase the efficiencies of delivery and so the bond committee recommended allocating some of those sidewalk replacement funds to three projects um Liberty Street Silverton Road and Commercial street so um councelor Stapleton you asked earlier about what the change was in the staff report I inadvertently left out that $40,000 on Commercial Street we had included it in the total number but somehow $440,000 even though in my pocket it would feel like a lot just you know got overlooked so so with that the recommendation for this agenda item um I have it up on the slide you also have it in your revised staff report and I'd be happy to to answer any questions thank you are questions for staff councelor Hoy sorry could you just go back to that slide one more time I wasn't quite done sorry I have a quick question oh sorry go ahead councelor Phillips I mean so this is thank you mayor Hoy and thank you Julie for being here here today um so I I just want to see if this paraphrase is accurate basically if we uh pass this recommendation we'll be adopting a process or an algorithm by which we as a community and a council uh get these buckets filled in and select projects throughout the City of Salem um yes you'll be process and criteria the ultimate decision of the locations will still come back to city council after going to to the bond steering committee but it will be framed by this process and criteria so uh I mean would this kind of create kind of the a filter a ranking process yes okay um and is this sufficient to take care of every single problem we have no do we have any sense on like order of magnitude will this take care of 5% of our need 10% I I don't really I mean the only one that I've looked the one I've looked at the closest is the um pedestrian Crossing one where um the allocation uh in the bond was for 3.54 million and given current cost that would build about seven pedestrian Crossings and we already have in the books about 160 or so so that's not quite that much um the other buckets are a little bit um higher you know the 8.7 for the sidewalk replacement but if you look at what Brandon's group has been already operating with about 2 million a year this one time 8.7 you know is still just a portion of that the sidewalk infill is the one where we probably have the least um data we know where we have missing sidewalks but what we're going to hear from the public in terms of what are the most important out of 300 miles I mean we're we're not going to be able to get some of my favorite streets I know well thank you uh for this this presentation and the small group meetings that we had ahead of time further questions councelor nordik thank you so I appreciate and support the criteria you've identified what I want to understand is you want us to follow the process process and apply this criteria for future projects and you want us to authorize money for three projects right now yes okay and did those three projects the Liberty Silverton and Commercial Street projects did they go through the scoring process no because the scoring process didn't ex doesn't exist until um okay Council approves it we did look high level at how we thought they would score you know um and so I think I would say that we thought that they would score pretty well but I no it did not okay I guess I just don't understand why aren't these three projects being put in the same list of potential projects with all the others why do they get to go first and without having the scoring criteria I will take a crack at it and if Brian wants to add something uh that be welcome um the reason we looked at these initially is because we do get efficiencies when we deliver um a Paving project we're already going to be doing the Ada ramps as required along those",

        "text": "part of the project was to develop a mapping and reporting tool and that is now done and has been launched and that's really the purpose here today and we'll jump into that pretty quick and show you the tool which um you know I um the project team has called it the Capstone delivery deliverable for the project I've called it the Crown Jewel I mean it's I think you'll like it it's pretty neat you know as we go into this um I want to extend some special thanks to the military for providing the funding for the project and we have Kim um on the line and I think we can actually see her too so um I'd like to give her a chance to introduce herself and say a few words thank you Wally can you hear me yes okay okay perfect uh good morning uh chair Grail Vice chair how members of the council my name is Ken Peter I am the Northwest training range Complex Community planning liaison officer I am a civilian I've been doing this about 11 years and the other hat I wear is the civilian lead for the Northwest Department of Defense Regional coordination team which brings together all of the military services in the entire Northwest which includes Oregon and Washington uh first and foremost I want to thank you for the opportunity to present here today we have really been working on this grant for several years it's a significant step towards early notification and coordination with the military including the Department of Defense and really supports with providing transparency about where we operate and I think really opens the door to opportunities for future coordination and viability of our training as we all try to kind of coexist in this environment where you know populations are increasing and renewable energy is growing with that and with our critical assets both air Land and Sea space in Oregon this has really been a great opportunity in working with the the staff to move strides in regards to coordination Foster compatible land air and CEO so again thank you for the opportunity thanks Kim I appreciate that appreciate the funding that DOD provided for the so I wanted to mention two core member of the team is the Oregon state Institute for natural resources or INR for short they led the mapping tool development did a fantastic job on it I think as you'll see does this slide just covers the goals for the aressa project overall of course Kim talked a little bit about DOD goals um project goals included creating relevant Educational Tools for and we're going to see of course the the big one the mapping tool here in a this shows you the major parts of the and again I don't want to spend a lot of time going over these individually but there was a renewable energy Market an industry assessment that was done very early on Military needs and interest assessment we looked at opportunities and constraints and those those first three were led by three different consulting firms that worked on the project the fourth one the citing procedures review was something actually I led and put together for the team and now we're into these very final phases the Outreach and of course the launch of this mapping and reporting tool that we'll see today and the project is basically wrapping up at the end of this month one other thing I wanted to mention there is an arrested report that has been issued and you can find a draft of it on odo's website and I'll show you the website in a minute that's kind of a hub for the project and a good place to look if you're trying to find other on the Orissa project the draft of this report is is out there on the website so again the mapping and reporting tool was developed by OSU INR it is housed on the Oregon Explorer which is for people in the in the planning and development business is I think pretty well known in Oregon as a place to go it's a it's a good or data and data layers associated with the team the eressa team reviewed more than 600 data sets as part of the development of this tool and then INR conducted some significant user testing with more than 100 participants it was their largest ever engagement to test this before it was so the tool itself has three main pillars or parts there's an explore data function which is where we'll go in a little bit there's also a reporting function which is a more at if you're a renewable energy developer and you're looking for a site that you can use in order to to do that and then get a report on the characteristics of the site that you've you've mapped out and by the way when you do that that information is only available to you as the user it's not stored anywhere so and that of course is a big concern for developers they they want to keep their information confidential for a very understandable reasons until they're ready to to release it but um there's no risk of that happening through the use of the tool and then finally there's a learn section as well where you can find information citing procedures for example and other things that would be would be relevant to the citing process okay so I'm going to go ahead and switch applications here so that we can do the okay so what I'm bringing up first is just the Odell website and I wanted to point out that if you scroll down a little bit over here on the right you can see there's a link for the Orissa project and a lot of information here on the project but then if we scroll down a little bit under key deliverables you see arrested mapping and reporting tool I have a quick question or really clarification should I make sure everybody's listening um you don't need any special software for this you know I mean it's just an online mapping tool so you don't need GIS software or anything you can access this just with a computer and access to the internet that is correct and I think the only advice that they give is to use a modern browser so um you know Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Firefox are the three that they've or the INR people have tested and know work with this view something else you may run into an issue so thank you for pointing that out sound appreciate it okay so this is the screen we saw earlier I'm pick a different window here because I've got some things queued up that we will need for the demo so as you if you go into the explore section you will see something like this I'll zoom out a little because you're just starting out in here you're going to see a map of what you're seeing there right now those lines so they're of course different map layers that you can turn on and off in here and the one that we have turned on at the moment are transmission lines so you can immediately see that Zoom back in a little bit the first thing I want to do and I'm I'm there are different ways to approach this because different people can use this tool for different purposes like I say developer might be you know prospecting for a site I'm approaching it from the standpoint how would somebody within our sighting group use it how would they use it maybe if they were supporting fsec and of course it would be looking at one of the projects that comes to us so I have uploaded the site boundary for a new project that's in here and I can click that data layer on now and I just need to zoom in a little so that we can see it and this is the echo solar project and we can make this look darker or we you know change its change the transparency so that you can see the layers underneath so you might wonder well well how can you do that how difficult it is is that to do that so I'm going to upload a second project here just to show you that it's pretty simple so there's an upload feature I just clicked on and then it says choose files now these do have to be in a particular format people who are familiar with GIS typically will know how to do this and I'm picking another project that has not officially come to council yet but uh maybe in the in the near future and this is the wagon trail project and I'm going to say upload and then it just asked me what I want to name that I think that name is fine and I say proceed it asks me if I want to customize anything and there it is so you can see this one fits really kind of like a jigsaw puzzle together with the echo project um it's directly adjacent to it so now that we've done that let's um let's take a look at some things related to this in the first place I'm going to go is with the military layers since the under this and we've talked about we should talk about the potential for conflicts with with military uses I want to click on some of those layers so as I do that bear with me just a second because one of the things that I know is nearby is the Boardman geographic area of concern so you can see up here at the top that um we get some overlap here with one of these layers I just clicked on so if you're using this you might want to know what is that exactly and hopefully you can can read that and maybe I need to make that a little and it off the one I wanted there we go so up here when I click on that you can see it highlights that layer and it tells you that's the Boardman geographic area of so you know as we if we're looking at a project like this that's immediately going to tell us you know the military needs to be contacted and aware that there's a project that is overlapping with one of their areas so moving on from there and you know there are a lot of layers in here we could end up doing this all day I promise you we won't there are a couple of things though that I want to point out so one of them is under the energy infrastructure you can see there's a layer in here for the Oregon energy facility site and Council so if we click on that lo and behold all of our fsec facilities come up and as was the case before we can make those a little darker or a little lighter another thing that may be of interest one windsurbance so if you're interested in seeing for example exactly where wind turbines are located the Slayer has all of them in a decrease the darkness a little on the fsec facilities obviously it's going to overlap with a lot of that but as we zoom in you know you can actually see those individual points in here let's do that also show those on the Washington side wind turbines kind of looked like I saw something it probably does",

        "text": " for energy projects permitted at the county level this is good it is necessary but it isn't in of itself insufficient We Believe notification by itself will not ensure early collaboration in favor of a win-win nor are there any assurances of addressing any potential adverse impacts to National Security uh currently we don't have a rule a rule or a viable process with odoe to ensure early notification of the dod for projects that are located in and around our critical training testing and operational areas the lack of notification has in the past resulted in additional time contested cases and outright removal of a project during construction is as Todd mentioned earlier with the vast majority of projects the implementation of a viable early notification policies in coordination with the military ensures that future land uses are compatible with military operations while fostering renewable energy and supporting of state regulations and policies the processes in place are ad hoc and create challenges with normal staff turnover and they don't provide a clear and transparent coordination process DOD is engaging early in this Ru making because proper development of these processes is critical for ensuring the optimal balance between commercial development and Military Readiness compatible renewable energy development is critical to preserve military operational capabilities Safeguard our military missions and protect the overhall the overall health safety and Welfare of the public living near military installations or training in operational areas and we do look forward to continue coordination with the Oregon Department of energy and to include the federal agency's rulemaking that is currently docket docketed for 2025 so I thank you for your time and I'll take any questions if you have some thank you council member Condon thank you chair gril um thank you for being here um today and I'm I'm not really familiar with how the counties and state work together so in your statement I think you said in 2019 uh statute was passed requiring notification from counties that we received notific yes notify I believe I'm not sure how the chain works I'll pass that one over to excuse me for the record Todd coret the um house B 2329 created sort of a car bout so there were previously FC jurisdictional projects that changed the threshold that then became County projects so there were then really three versions of jurisdiction County projects that were smaller than the house bill 2329 projects those do not require notice to the dod then there are the house bill 2329 projects built into statute that requires those projects that fit within that um subset do require in addition to the dod other uh early notifications including the department of energy um so so that subset of bigger projects at the county level currently do obligate um counties to provide that notification okay so my um follow up um my my question is really so where where certainly reviewing our rules and doing Ru Ru making on this I think you said that the the requirement in 2329 was insufficient for the county so how our rules don't impact the county so how does the dod um work with the counties versus the state for that sufficiency I guess currently uh we work with counties on a case-by Case basis as we learn of projects we will go and talk with the County Commission and and uh attend their commission meetings um either in support or with concerns and to date it hasn't been a tremendously um it has we haven't had a lot of business in that regard but we have been dealing with um both Morrow County and Wheeler County and it's largely about air air rotes and windmill projects that might in in infringe on an air route a training route council member thank you thank you sorry council member con council member buer Cher gra thank you um just to acknowledge that DOD has been very supportive of those mapping efforts both Statewide and I understand that there are some new grants to local governments to help better understand where those military assets are without divulging National security issues and that's that's a big tension but just know that DOD is supporting efforts I think both at the state and local level to map those resources so decision makers can be better informed about the potential issues so thank you for that and thank you for joining us today thank you and yes and that is actually true Wheeler County I believe right now is uh looking through some grants for that purpose this is chair gril I think it's uh I would hope that developers hear this conversation and something that they think about beyond what staff does they have the ability to reach out and and be mindful as well so I think the burden is not just for us as well secretary cornette thank you CH gril for the record Todd cornette um you know as was pointed out the aresta tool you know was designed I mean you know it has a lot of other values but the primary purpose you know and the reason why the Department of Defense funded that was it did map those resources it did provide information about those or rather those assets um on the Tool uh and there's the ability to do you know sort of view them and identify them but you can also do kind of an analysis of I want to put a project here what's in the vicinity of it you know and if there is a military asset you know either air or or ground that will pop up provide you know who's the contact for that military asset so you know that and of itself and it doesn't do everything certainly but it was a lot to try to identify those and provide that um early you know communication so hopefully you know developers are using that identifying that having that early communication with the Department the Department of Defense as I said we've taken that on our own sort of responsibility to make that you know connect ction with the Department of the defense um we've done that we will continue to do that as I said we have no concern about this Ru making uh we we we staff are supportive of it U whenever it comes on to essentially reflect what we already do from a non-regulatory standpoint but make it make it a regulatory standpoint whatever ultimately that ends up being thank you I just also this chair girl would like to say that um you know sometimes uh the department um I've set gets criticized for not being good communicators and listening and the fact that you've led the staff to direct this type of communication on your own without being required um I think it's just a testament to our our commitment to to working with uh the party so thank you again for showing up and and helping us and I'm sure Tom is taking diligent note of what youve said okay well thank you very much and I appreciate the time just as a reminder to those of you that are on the webinar if you're interested in making a comment at this time you're going to go ahead and go to the bottom main window there's a set of icons click on the participant that will raise your hand if you'd like to make a comment you can click it again to lower your hand if you're on the phone you're going to press star three to raise your hand and Then star three again to lower your hand at this time I do not see anyone with their hand raise let's give them another minute or so to see what happens oh now I have a hand raised I have a a phone call I'm going to go ahead and un mute your phone you are unmuted do you hear me hello can hear you okay um this is Irene Gilbert uh 23 can Adams Avenue L Grand Oregon and um listening to the rule changes and and updates that are going to occur I think it's is important to look at rules uh fairly frequently and um one thing I'd like to comment on just in terms of rules in general and that is um fsac does have according to the statute their role is to protect the citizens and the natural resources of the state and I think that rul making should reflect that and um part of that should be considering the cost to the citizens um if you when you're looking at rules require rules that are clear provide the same treatment for all developers it will go a long ways in helping to meet that um the goal of fat I have found that when rules um rules are Flex ible and a and developers are giving a what I would call a deal on mitigation or um any kind of requirements what it amounts to is someone pays and if developers are not paying their fair share it's going to fall on electric users citizens and the agencies in the state um what is a given is that mitigation is never going to leave citizens or resources whole and I can give you an example um for of well for Idaho Power there were arguments made about how they should not have to pay the same U bond amount as other groups because it would affect the rates to their customers and and they were never going to default um now since that decision Idaho Po's uh credit rate has fallen to just above junk bonds and uh part of the thing that really is somewhat irritating to me is Idaho Power has gone now to the Pu and when I looked at I calculated the um the cost currently for Idaho Powers customers in Idaho and those in Oregon for well 1,250 kilowatt of hours of power per month and the cost for an Idaho Power customer in Idaho for a year was um was $1,320 the cost for an Oregon customer $1,390 now the uh Idaho pu just considered a request for rate increase and the request was for 88.6% increase for their Idaho customers um idah hope power was granted 4.25% increase but then they have also in December requested a rate increase for the Oregon customers which represents um roughly um 100,000 people in Mal here and Baker County and the request for increase is for 19.28% for their Oregon customers um the request for instance just to give you an idea of what that looks like for irrigators in Idaho the request reflected an 11.7% increase which they didn't get that much but that's what they asked for for Oregon they're requesting over a 35% increase in the cost for Oregon's irrigation customers so I really think that when you hear arguments that oh gosh it's going to affect our customers um I think a better approach is just to say we treat our energy developers the same in Oregon and it's not reflected in there you know there's no guarantee when they when a developers able to avoid mitigation or avoid you know any kind of rule or sort of sidestep the the full",

senator solman he's introduced to Bill as men and already what does that look like in comparison to what we're talking about um I have not seen that particular LC I also mentioned I forgot to mention this um there is a joint committee that is going to be addressing semiconductor work it is going to be co-chaired by representative Janelle Bynum from Clackamas County and Senator Janine solman from Washington County they will be the co-chairs of that joint committee so I enjoy my evenings in Salem uh but so I think that is a bill that she brings to the table year over year I don't know how it

out there there's placeholders we also have independent game share bills that aren't part of the task force but extend the game share out longer and I think we need to be a little bit careful one of these parties Tom vanderzanden has been associated with two questions two two area questions one is the folks that the grand bargain property eliminated or changed from Urban Reserve to rural Reserve commissioner Willie was intimating that area it goes Jackson School Road out to Weibel Creek was that area then and that's an area that commissioner excuse me Senator solman then previously rep Solomon had been coming back to each year then but Mr vandersanden had also been working with the Springville Road area that Multnomah County had designated as rural Reserve close to the north eastern section of your area that the court of appeals had also addressed was that Tom Den or MLG well Tom stopped working on that and MLG has carried it on as have some other parties okay I just want to make sure I'm thinking this but the reason I covered that is because of history and different different people's experiences and memory with common common names that's all that sounds good to me so I I have um I have quite a few thoughts on this so they're not all they're not all locked in stone or anything like that so I consider this a discussion I consider it just an opportunity to share thoughts uh you know I first of all I think I think it's important for us to as a a partner with the state and not miss a potential opportunity that's one thing and when you look at the the opportunity for money from the feds for I just want to get that on the table I think I think that that's important um that doesn't necessarily mean that that site has to be here but it does mean that we would work with the state to find where the highest potentialist and I have a feeling that Washington County would be in the top top three or possibly top two so so and I and I and I also believe that it's our responsibility to look to contribute to the state's economy to look to contribute to the um the the opportunity for good paying jobs all the things that we talk about in relationship to Economic Development those are all pieces that I think are important while that said I also do not think that the county us County at large here should be encumbered in any way by those decisions and when I when I say in any way I mean primarily financially that this cannot be our responsibility and and it has to be a a equitable distribution of of uh opportunities after the after the fact and I'm talking about gain share now so and while I've had opportunities to have some conversations with several of you around the table uh the one thing that sticks in my mind is the concept that the parameters under which sip was developed previously can't and shouldn't apply in this time frame we're talking about a whole new set of circumstances so it should be a whole new set of negotiations if in fact we get down that road and this is a site but I do I will say to all of you here that I believe it's by responsibility to help further the economy of ourselves locally regionally and Statewide so and I and I would say that that's the responsibility of any commissioner in any in any County throughout the state so those are those are my thoughts that doesn't but like I said it's important for me to make it perfectly clear that we need to protect ourselves in this process and we need to make sure that um any agreements if it gets to that point uh we are we've learned from our previous lessons so that's that's where I'm gonna leave yeah but everybody's had some good comments and I certainly can't disagree with hardly any of them having been involved in all of those and uh uh looked at it from the standpoint of Economic Development I I I think it was good decision we always looked at it from a standpoint wow kind of like a big mall you could get a key tenant in there and that's the big tenant and then you have it all the small uh businesses around it who grow and and prosper and that's important the worry we had which I it's just that we're in the back of my mind is that Detroit had the same problem a long time ago they had a lot of mobile factories and all of a sudden it didn't seem to be so popular and it they've suffered for that so we never wanted to be a one trick pony as they say I didn't want us to be what industry yeah one industry is a better way of saying it yeah so that's that's a worry in the back of my mind but my specific concern to these um one and I started the last time because we we need to have a really strong partner who understands you know what we were doing we go about doing business a complete uh healthy areas and cities are more than just a few roads that come the plant and so even if they were to say We'll build the roads uh you know through some it you know complete areas of livability had Parks they have other kinds of facilities that are necessary if you're going to have a livable community and if it's gee we're going to supersite okay I mean you can do what you want but are you going to do it in such a fashion that all you do is take a big piece of ground throw in a few lanes of Highway and say great they're here now you all attend to them well if you're a Hillsborough and I can't speak for them a little bit about them but Jerry do a much better job what you're going to do with all of the new housing and kids that come in and the school's going to benefit at all from that if he's going to have to provide Parks not he anymore but through the city of Hillsborough there's going to be any funds for that I already would mention clean water I mean these plants are very intensive water use and they're very intensive and cleanup facilities and they don't provide all that on-site so what does that mean to the general public who we represent just not you know them are already going to have to go up to to affect that are there going to be some funds from the state to do that part about air containment I remember when I that was back in the old days I've been served on jpac with Nina and she came and said Roy it's not just that you're going to violate the Press well we're going to send you a letter of non non-containment you're gonna you're you're not gonna build anything out there anymore do you understand how serious this is and I said let's go talk and immediately the board took action and she came to me about two meetings later said wow you guys are terrific you really pay attention so where does all that go I bottom line I I think the state needs to be a partner and understand communities or something other than just pieces of land or people or the liability and prosperity goes far out from an immediate decision of you know 90 people down there who might make a decision in 2023 who aren't going to be there in 40 years when some other group of people are going to be dealing with the problems locally so that's why we want to gain share we said we had to have something to attend some of these Community needs so I'm offer a game share except you know tips are nice I like that too uh and I get back I guess right where Jerry was in the beginning I mean I I think it's healthy and I that's okay I'm spoke too too I was healthy for the community but we can't and you said it best we did we can't give away the farm just because we're proud to create jobs only to have that cost as our whole livability I mean we can't do that if that's what it's about forget it let's uh to say we respectfully like you but go locate somewhere else we'll give away their complete communities for there a chance to have some you know a few more jobs so I like the idea I'd love to work as a partner with the state I would love them to come in and understand and equip us with enough Revenue to be sustainable after the initial plant goes up so is it sustainable we look at that area isn't sustainability is everything and we've we've talked about the concept course we're so long the concept of being the economic engine of Oregon was like something good the reality is that it's a burden in so many different ways and I think that that's the other piece you know we're our own worst enemies to some to some degree here but I and I do think of that uh the fact that we need to make sure that others know that yes we might be but you're benefiting and we're paying a lot of the costs here well if I could jump in on that because first of all the chips money is designed to offset a lot of this costs of this development secondly is the City of Hillsboro would probably Annex all of that if it's going to be developed they're going to be developing it there that's why we have that's why we have sip agreements um we can talk about um a significant modification of the Sip agreement but the fact of the matter is again the feds are going to hold us accountable for um and and the only way we're going to be attractive to this development is to have something like a sip agreement in place and we start talking about redoing the entire sip agreement",

chance to get through those i had difficulty accessing them online and i'd ask that we postpone uh reviewing the june minutes until next anyone have any problems with delaying those until next meeting okay we will take that thank you natalie and those will be held off until next thank you next on the agenda is the council secretary reporter thank you madam chair uh first of all i want to apologize to those online we had a little bit of a uh with the wrong meeting link in the webinar so looks like we have 19 attendees so i think the word's getting so appreciate your patience on that we did start the meeting 15 minutes late to allow people to get that information and log in so hopefully that information is getting out first i will give a staffing update so we have just recently hired a replacement for chris clark as the operations in hollyoam policy honors three so as i indicated before uh chris has taken a new position um as a utility in energy analyst three so a senior citing analyst uh but he's continuing work on the rulemaking and that's what that position primarily does so we've hired a person to replace chris so chris doesn't have to continue doing double duty uh like he's been doing for a few months uh the person's name is blake crowe blade will start on august 22nd let's give you a little bit of a background for blake he has a masters of urban and regional planning from the university of new orleans a bachelor of arts from the university of alabama currently blake is a renewable development associate with invenergy in where he is a project manager and developer of utility scale solar and storage projects he was previously a senior associate planner for a consulting company in new where he was a project manager and a main contributor for projects such as updating a city's comprehensive plan statewide working on a statewide comprehensive outdoor recreation plan as well as city and regional bicycle and master plan so he has definitely some work in the energy field as well as doing land use and writing code and comprehension plan so we think it's a good fit looking forward to starting in august next on my list are project updates so the echo solar project given an update previously to the council on that they'd submitted their notice of intent we're in that phase right now we'll be holding a public information meeting on july 27th at 5 30 p.m in the port of morrow river in boardman certainly council members are encouraged or welcome to attend either in person or virtually if you do want to attend in person please let us know and we can make reservations and accommodations for you but otherwise you can uh attend online or we'll give you an update and just as a reminder the project is a 1.25 gigawatt solar pv generation facility proposed on 10 900 acres or 17 square miles uh and it is entirely non-exclusive farming stone land in normal county and just south east uh of the corner of the gordon bombing range so in the vicinity of the city uh next on my other sort of the last thing on my list are the upcoming council meetings uh kel and tardy weather during the boardman hemingway agenda and we'll talk a little more detail and repeat some of these but i think it's probably helpful to talk about these twice today just because of the complexity of the meeting steps for the board and admin project so i appreciate council's flexibility um so regularly scheduled council meeting um on the whatever the thursday and friday was we are not going to have that uh we are going to have the next council meeting august 29th starting sometime in the late afternoon early evening entirely on the 30th and the 31st of august the meeting will be in the grand it will be at eastern oregon university in the gilbert room so that will uh incorporate step two of the remaining steps before council's final decision on gordon and hemingway so the first step um is today the last agenda item today and i won't get into that until we'll get into more details but just to review a preview for council members and then anybody else online so step two will be review of the proposed order so those are standards implicated in the contested case it will include proposed contested case order review exception and exceptions hearing so kellen will start um and we'll go sort of standard by standard calen will start and do a presentation for each standard on the portions unrelated to the contestant case then council will conduct a straw hole if you want to make any changes to the findings of fact conclusions of law or conditions of approval in the proposed order or not we'll have that on the record um then jesse ratcliffe who is legal counsel to counsel on boardman will present each of the contested case issues where exceptions were filed so the hearing officer submitted her contested case order basically her conclusion on all the issues in the contested case there was a 30-day time frame for people to file exceptions so whether they disagreed with their conclusions there are a host of exceptions that were filed and then there were responses to exceptions so jesse will go over those issues the filed exceptions and the and we will then open it up for oral testimony for those party or limited parties with file exceptions so they will get a chance to testify to council idaho power and the department will be given an opportunity to respond those oral comments as well and then finally um council will conduct a straw poll and this will be that sequence of events between jesse the world testimony and stronghold will be done on each of the filed exceptions so that's why we have it built in for two and a half days worth of timing because and we've been built in a conservative approach hopefully that was correct and we'll be able to conclude all of that in those two and a half days uh in the then assuming we can get that done in that time frame staff will then take any changes that occur today any material changes that occur today from council's review of the proposed order any changes that occur uh based upon what occurs in brand in august and we will do a draft we'll create a draft of the final order so that'll be in the week or two after could be around september 16 so we will get that out then the next council meeting in listed as september 22nd and 23rd those dates will not work um so i'm going to be reaching out to council members and nancy o'rourke council members for availability possibly the week after um we think that that's only going to require a one-day meeting but we still have to wait and see what other items are on the agenda but for b2h again assuming that we can get through those other things before that and it lines up then at the september meeting there would be a material change hearing assuming there's any material changes that have occurred so any of the parties or limited parties can testify on any of those material changes that are included in the draft final similarly as before idaho power and the department will have the opportunity to respond if they choose to any of those oral comments and then council will conduct a straw poll on any of those uh comments and responses to see if there are any additional changes and then if council is ready you know at that same council meeting there will be the council hearing to adopt the final order so you would uh you know do that sort of final and whether or not there are changes between the proposed order the hearing officers proposed contested um you know if the draft final order is good or if there are minor tweaks we can",

        "text": " the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features for example the school benefits from energy bill savings and e-web is able to use the batteries on this site to provide grid services during their day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing electric loads that can be served by the system during a power so the battery storage units and they are shown as bess they're the black ones on the bottom battery energy storage systems those are able to provide power to the water well and the backup loads within the school and you can see that there's a switch shown at the main breaker and that's to ensure that this micro grid is isolated from the rest of eweb's power grid in the event of a power outage and that's to provide safety to their line workers and so now that the program is essentially up and running we've we've got staff to implement the program um pandy pandyan krishnaswami is on the line today he's our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here james james kogel and policy analyst uh urban department of energy um the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th and there are four of them one for each of the project categories there's 12 million dollars available between the four opportunity with more opportunity announcements we'll announce later after this round closes with additional funds online applications will open shortly and we'll only be accepting applications through the online next slide please opportunity you know announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and six different stakeholders and following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are elig eligible for the program the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits the scoring criteria includes topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice jobs and economic development direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses inclusion of inclusive hiring promotion policies procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans and geographic and project diversity the grants will be awarded on a competitive basis at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories how the funding will be distributed will be kind of depend on the number of and strength of applications in the different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in the legislation next slide please just kind of i'm going to take you through uh kind of a quick uh introduction to how what the application portal will look like um so you'll be able to once it's live it's not yet um access it through the department of energy community renewable energy grant program web page um we're expecting the application to be finalized and available in april so you can see the red arrow uh points to where it will be available soon um so next slide please um you'll also if you are familiar with uh odo's customer service portal be able to access it from there i just click on the financial and incentive uh tab at the top and it'll be available in a

for the construction grants the application applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek site control file the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and many other requirements provided by odo in the performance agreement to be eligible for that thirty percent uh following the signing performance next slide please and we'd like to we'd be happy to hear any questions you have regarding the program uh if there's any specific information you'd like more detail on please let us know um but yeah thank you very much while people are thinking of questions they might have i see wade has a hand up i'll get to in one second one thing i just wanted to be really clear about is resilience can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people the bill itself has a definition for resilience um for this particular program and it's that type of resilience that's like community benefits and also this program has renewable in the title and just to be clear when we're talking about energy resilience projects under this program umbrella they need to be paired with a renewables element so i just wanted to like immediately kind of put a pin on that because it's something that's come up in other places and i just wanted to make sure that we kind of level set that from the start but the bill tells us what resilience is and it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as it might be more broadly outside of the parameters of the program so i'll start with that and then wade um we'll get you off mute and and you sh i'll tell you there there you go you can go ahead and ask your questions now wait so i have a question uh first off uh thanks for putting the picture of our new operations center there on that slide it's kind of nice to and it's a rare sunny day here at the coast in that picture so that's equally my question is surrounding the timeline for the project i noticed that it said that we had to start construction within 12 months and it had to be completed within 36 months you know that does make me a little bit anxious given the current supply chain around the the country and the world of what we're facing getting some materials and some certain items so i i'm just wondering if if there's going to be any flexibility around that once we start to go out for procurement and we find that we're having issues that's a really great question wade it's something that is some of these timelines are set in the statute itself and when the bill was passed in 2021 we didn't have the same situation as we do now so we've certainly heard a lot about that rob can you go ahead and um dig in a little bit more on what we heard about that and what what maybe we can do um in addition to what the statute might limit us how the statute might limit us yeah so that's a good close read of the rules in the statute wade and it does have a one year to start and three years to complete requirement the bill also allows us to grant an so we'll be able to grant extensions for these issues associated with um you know the supply chain i'll have james correct me if i'm wrong but i believe we can extend a project an additional year for the construction projects and so if if we find that there's a lot of um beyond those time frames we'll have to address those as they come because we are kind of limited to the statutory language but we are going to be very accommodating up to the limits of the bill itself okay thank you great thanks rob and wade we'll be keeping tabs on this this year too and um you know it could be something that the legislature might hear from people and want to take up um making some changes there just because of the supply chain or something so um just know that there's that legislative session coming and we don't necessarily have any plans to do that i'm not suggesting that but it might be just given how this year goes that it does come up there too all right thank great um so um alex um from corvallis had a question that i always like to try to answer and then like let rob and james correct me if i'm wrong so this is one where they can do that um the question was can a project be just for renewable generation without being paired with the resilience aspect and that's absolutely that's absolutely possible we have sort of four categories of projects and so one of them is what we sort of called pure renewables as like shorthand and then there's the renewables plus resilience the issue is that um the the bill is set up and our program is set up",

growing and changing we also want to make sure that we're implementing changes in state law and rules and as issues come up for that need clarification and Corrections we do that as as well um the last time we did a major update of the UDC was in 2022 we both updated the code for the r salum project which updated our comprehensive plan as well as a big code update um earlier in 2022 today's code Amendment really focuses on housing and encouraging Housing Development um as we all know housing is a big issue a big need in the City of Salem so we're always looking for ways to promote Housing Development um so the code Amendment really looks at helping promote housing development through several ways by streamlining the approval process by allowing more housing options and by making it easier by revising standards that actually promote Housing Development we're always again also looking to comply with new state laws and rules um that come our way so the first proposed change that I'm going to talk about today is would allow adjustments to design standards so today across the city there's various areas of Salem where we have regulations that really regulate the design of sites and the design of buildings there are design standards this can be everything from requiring um canopies and awnings or um regulating where parking can be located on a site so in most of the areas across the city where we have these design standards we allow people to do adjustments um I'll explain that in a second um but there's three areas currently that we don't allow adjustments that's the West Salem Central Business districts where which you can see on the map that's showing right now as well as the uh Edgewater Second Street mixed juuse Corridor and the Portland Fairgrounds overlay zone so again these are the only areas in the city right now where we have design standards and a person who is applying U for a project can't apply for an adjustment when they can't meet a standard so what does this all mean so today for example if you're in one of those three zones or overlay and say you cannot meet um a standard related to um providing awnings along the front of your building if you can't meet that one standard you are kicked into design review where you need to now have a public hearing process so this is an opportunity for the public to come um and provide their testimony and um a decision is made on that um project this can often add time money and some uncertainty to a project and so in recent years what we have been doing as a city we've been shifting to allowing adjustments so this is an administrative process so it's approved at the staff level but it still allows for opportunity for the public to comment because we still provide um public notice this streamlines the approval process and again really aligns with how we've been shifting as a city to promote um uh faster approvals particularly as it relates to housing so this proposed change again would address the West Salem Central business district um Edgewater Second Street mixed use district and the Portland Fairgrounds Road overlays on so the next proposed change um is similar and that again it would allow for that administrative adjustment process to special uses that are residential so today for example in the single family Zone um if you want to develop a townhouse um it is considered a special use so this is a use that is allowed by right in the zone so there's no public hearing process um but there are special standards um for like building design or maybe setbacks that relate just to that specific use so it's called a special use um currently if you are doing a townhouse or some of the other residential housing types that's a special use if you cannot meet one of those very specific special use standards like a setback for example you then have to apply for a conditional use um permit so the conditional use permit uh similar the example before was that you would have to go through a public hearing process in recent years we've been trying to again um expedite the approval process and so for example we have been making it easier um to apply for adjustments so if you cannot meet a special use standard for an accessory dwelling unit or middle housing two family three family four family Cottage clusters for example you can apply for this administrative approval so this proposed change would allow for uh development like to a special use like a town home to go through an adjustment process I'm going to hand it over to Bryce who's now going to talk about a change to the process for historic uh thank you Unice uh so in terms of historic to uh the process today uh specifically dealing with residential uh projects that either affect uh properties within a historic district or individually listed properties there would be probably two major types of design review that would apply that the most common that would be a class uh one minor historic design riew and a class two major historic design review and the way historic design riew process that process works today it's not necessarily whether or not you need to get you know deviate from a standard or not it's the process you go through depends on what you're doing to the historic resource in terms of you know changing windows or changing changing the faade or uh and and what thought pad you're changing so if you're changing a main facade of a building that faces a primary Street that's going to you know depending on the the type of work you're doing on the building that would kick you most most likely into a major historic design review with the landmarks commission and other types of changes could be um minor you know class two historic design review applications that are reviewed by staff uh through a notice process uh but in order to uh streamline the process for housing developments um you know if you're doing new housing within historic districts or new housing on uh properties where there is a uh a listed historic resource on it uh we're changing the process of bit to establish a class two process an administrative process uh where we send notice uh to neighbors and there's an opportunity to comment but there is not a uh inability uh but it doesn't go to the to the landmarks commission so uh so we're changing it to establish a baseline administrative uh staff review process for any uh project within a historic district or affecting a historic property where you're adding new housing uh uh as a result of the project and it could be done by staff and it notice will go out and there would be an ability to appeal that decision uh but it wouldn't automatically kick you up to a landmarks commission review as would be the possibility today depending on what you were doing so we're streamlining the process in that respect um and then also we are allowing like Unice was speaking about adjustments to standards um like those special use standards she was mentioning that you can now do an adjustment to those standards we're doing a similar uh we're proposing a similar Amendment for historic design review standards by also making those stand standards adjustable specifically if they're uh being applied to a project that is developing new housing units um and so what's kind of unique with this uh set of amendments though is we're giving a lot of options for the applicant to choose from so essentially there's four main options that will be available to an applicant that's looking to do new housing on a historic property either they can choose to to meet the all of the standards and and be subject to a staff administrative review or they could choose to meet the standards but maybe there's one or two that they don't meet they could ask for an adjustment to those standards that they don't meet and that would still be at a staff level review um but then they could also choose to uh and this would be voluntarily up to their up to their own choice they could also CH kick it up to the historic landmarks commission and and and have it subject to a class three major historic design review involving a public hearing either based on the guidelines uh historic design review guidelines included in the historic chapter or based on the standards with an adjustment so uh we really give a lot of options for either the applicant to go with a staff level review or a landmarks commission review and so we feel that that does meet uh will help meet the housing needs for uh folks that want to do new housing in residential districts and comply with the requirements of state law and next slide Unis and as part of that as I mentioned we're allowing the adjustments uh adjustments to Historic standards the way it's structured right now uh in the code you can't adjust a historic standard what you would do is if you don't meet a standard you would go to the landmarks commission and be based your review would be based on the more flexible design guidelines however again we are making the historic design review standards adjustable and uh because the historic design review standards are very specific to how the buildings uh appears and how it fixs within the context and character of the historic district um we wouldn't want necessarily just you know the normal staff to review them so in this case we're allowing either staff Kimberly or Jake uh to review adjustments uh to Historic uh design review standards or if it's going to with a class three major historic design review subject to the to the landmarks commission review we all also allowing the landmarks commission to review adjustments today again the landmarks commission and the historic staff only review historic design review but then this will be our first uh allowance of any other type of application Beyond historic design review to be reviewed by historic staff and the landmarks Commission because they are the ex the subject matter experts in terms of uh what it means",

        "text": "I understand how many folks are with us already I can't see the attendant list it looks like we've got about 10 folks on right now okay well I guess we can go ahead and get started yeah go ahead good afternoon everybody and welcome to the Oregon Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and conservation block grant program we're uh casting a webinar to help answer all questions that you may have and uh we I think we've won some sort of award for having the longest webinar title that I've ever seen so that's off to us at that this point let's see on our next slide I want to just introduce our EBG team that's a lot shorter version um I myself I'm Roger kuu I'm an analyst with the organization been with uh energy uh for about 10 years now and I'll hand it over to Emily thanks Roger hi everybody my name is Emily salary I am um one of our federal grants officers at Odo um I've been with the agency for just about a year now and um I'm sort of involved with all of the different Federal opportunities that some of you probably heard about um coming to the state and um helping us acquire those funds and um figure out what to do with them and then track track them as we as we go through these projects making sure that we're we're using them appropriately and I'll uh hand it over to Sarah hi all my name is Sarah murky I'm the community navigator for the Oregon Department of energy um I started last year in a new program um and my job is to help environmental justice communities Access Federal and State funding for energy projects so feel free to reach out to me with my email on the screen um on this project or this program probably Roger and Emily the better people but for um any of our other programs that you're interested in I'm happy to be the front door person thanks I like the way you put that Sarah the front door person very good all right we can get started with um some program goals for the eecbg program uh they're made available through section 40552 of the iig ja to support local government projects uh the aim is to reduce fossil fuel emissions uh lower a community's total energy use improve Energy Efficiency and also or build a clean and Equitable energy economy eligible activities I'm going to cover these in Greater detail later but just in a broad brush attempt here we want it we want the eligible activities to be centered around Energy Efficiency so building Audits and retrofits uh that include grid intera activity electrification and home energy scoring so those sort of messaging campaigns throughout your community and then also Energy savings performance contracts for uh efficiency and electrification of your own municipal buildings I'm sure some of you have had espcs before where you hire a contractor and they come out and do the energy work for you and also we're including building efficiency and campaigns the uh next category is Renewables and that is uh solar installations and battery storage such as power purchase agreements and direct ownership um transportation is a third bucket and that's uh centers around electric vehicles for municipal fleets EV charging infrastructure for the community one by the way we're recording this I think we probably mentioned that somewhere in here but uh also this information will be available in the recording and the slides available on our website so you'll be able to dig into that and at the end of the webinar we'll go ahead and open it up for questions so you can come back and say hey what about that slide and I had a question about this or that so just want you to be relaxed about what we're going cover eligible entities this is Emily's slide so take it away Emily so great thanks Roger um I I'll also mention that this uh apolog ologe if you already said this Roger but this slideshow is posted to our website so if we're going too fast for you feel free to follow along um through our website and download that that presentation there however you guys want to use that um one of the things um I should probably just mention is that the ecbg award was um given to us um through uh the US Department of energy and one of the requirements of this and hence the reason we're talking to you guys today is that we have to sub subgrant at least six % of the funding that we received um and that's what we're getting ready to to open um this this week so um one of the big questions that we've gotten um around this program so far has had a lot to do with am I even eligible to apply right so um one of the rules is that you must be a unit of uh uh unit of local government pardon me and so while we know that that obviously includes cities and counties um we've done a little bit of research and digging and found that that also includes other local government entities so if you're curious about what that might include or if you are one of these um that would be multi-jurisdictional Regional governments and special service districts um there are 28 types of special service districts and um there's a small little link there at the bottom of the PowerPoint presentation that um goes into the Oregon revised statutes um about who who is included in those special service districts so the great news is is that um there are a lot more of you out there that are eligible to apply for this funding than just simply cities and counties another important thing that I just wanted to mention is that um you must not otherwise be eligible for a direct EBG award um and then there is um a link that we can share with you guys about who is on that list of eligible entities for a direct award from the US Department of energy um more likely than not you probably already are aware of this um but but you can check that list just to ensure that you weren't already on it um and then just another important thing to note that the the following types of um entities are not included as eligible entities and those would be um organ Health and Science University the Oregon State Bar and then any intergovernmental entity that's been formed by a public body with another state or with a political subdivision of another state and then um any intergovernmental entity formed by a public body with an agency of the federal government all right next please perfect thanks Roger so so um a couple of things about about this um particular program is that um if you are selected to receive an award award use of this opportunity will be subrecipients of funds awarded to Odo and you'll be identified as a subrecipient selected for a sub awward I say a lot of Sub Sub sub here what that means is that um you know these are not State dollars but rather they're subg grants passed through Odo using federal funds so what that means is that subrecipients are going to have programmatic decision-making and and responsibility for making progress against goals that you'll set um U which will include regular project and financial reporting and then um the performance agreements will be between Odo and subrecipients and they'll include required Federal terms and conditions including the flowdown requirement of the terms and conditions to sub recipient contractors and subcontractors as applicable um all of these requirements you can find listed in the application on our website next slide please all right so we'll jump into how do you even apply right so first off um the uh the applications are going to be served through our customer service portal so you'll need an account and you can register for an account um at any time starting today so that portal link that's there um you can start by by accessing that and then the actual portal to to apply will open on Friday Friday March 22nd and um one of the things to know about this particular program is that the this is not a competitive program um so we're not collecting all of these applications and going to be reviewing them on a competitive basis at the end of at the end of the the deadline there we're going to be awarding them on a rolling basis of on a first come first serve um basis so you can see um in the opportunity announcement that's on our website the criteria that you need to hit in order to be eligible um so yeah we'll have these funds available first come first serve um on a ruling basis um so they may be expended before the deadline um we may have obligated all of the funds before then but um otherwise the portal will close on Tuesday May 20124 and then um there's a little email address here where you can um send any questions that you might have about the application in the program itself and we'll do our best to try to keep a frequently asked questions document updated um for you all to see next slide please all right so the package the application package sub mittle process it's going to be through the portal website only so we're not going to take applications you know emailed over to us or sent in Via usmail um we'll receive um the ones that are received after the deadline won't unfortunately be able to be considered um and just make sure that you have all the required information uploaded um and submitted through the portal in order to be considered um much of the details of applic application itself um will go over here in just a second um but those will be submitted in form Fields through the portal website itself but there are a few additional things that need to be uploaded as attachments with the application um and I'll go through those but there are four main things here the sf424a the budget justification workbook there's an authorized application letter that's required and a Davis BAC an assurance letter so the authorized application letter um is basically written authorization from uh the applicant's governing body and just ensuring that you have permission um and allowing you to submit this application on behalf of whatever entity you're you're hailing from uh and then the Davis bacon Assurance letter this goes back to one of the federal requirements for this particular program which um includes um the Davis bacon act so if you're doing any groundbreaking construction activity um there is a Davis BAC Davis bacon component to the program um and this is just attesting to the fact that you're going to comply with that all right next slide please all right so um starting the application this is where um you will enter in all of the contact information so your organization name the address um the principal investigator and the business officer are two different contacts that we'd like to see it's possible that it may be the same person but essentially",

        "text": " tied to them but i want to appreciate how much odo and other stakeholders have focused on this particular issue and comments and questions in this space and want to make sure that that is part of the problem statement is how do we do this in a way that really maximizes community benefit and minimizes environmental justice burden and in particular recognizes tribal sovereignty thank you ariana um again i'll note again for anyone who's on uh the meeting as member of the public uh if you've used the hand raised function uh we will note note you and get you in the queue here to jump in the discussion i will go ahead though and move us on to the next question which is on incrementalism incremental approaches to regionalization have been discussed as an alternative to rto formation and some have suggested there may be potentially different definitions for what might constitute sufficient versus insufficient incrementalism so in terms of steps what incremental steps have already been taken are under consideration or could be considered i think we've talked a lot about the ones that have been taken but the the latter two perhaps not as much and then sufficient incrementalism can members define how much incremental regionalization is sufficient for their it sounded like discussion the last meeting was that perhaps there's some significant differences over sort of what's acceptable quote-unquote so i will look for hand raised hands to be raised here and i see uh michael uh from pngc he says his hand raised i don't know if that's a residual hand raise i forget what we were calling that uh i think representative marsh had a comment for it and then it was repeated sorry that was uh that core hand management very good management i i lost the yeah poor hand management well feel free to jump in if you do have another question or another comment michael but uh sarah thank you yeah i mean i i don't mean to sound repetitive but i think i'll just attach what i said before to this and say that there is some kind of track record being formed with an incremental approach to those three major functions of an rto has had some traction but also has its own imperfections because it isn't integrated so i'll just i just repackaged my answer for this slide um the thing i would observe that i've been thinking about a lot lately and i don't have an answer is there the journey that the region has been on with eim and then thinking about extended day ahead market e dam for we you know we clearly haven't gotten that far yet it's still concept not operations but one thing that's been sometimes observed is this desire based on the diversity of our region and where folks are at with how pro or maybe a little bit more conservative they are about fully jumping into the full market optimization that they might be able to choose which depth of market optimization they want so for example you know what i've i've heard this discussed you know maybe i just want to sign up for the real time sub hourly optimization ein or maybe i want to be day ahead and real-time optimization or maybe i want full rto but there has been some acknowledgement in the west that different companies different load interests may want different flavors and the one thing we've never really answered that i've been thinking about is is that even possible is it possible to have a mix um like an all a cart menu of of market options all operating under the same framework or at some point from a feasibility operations perspective the computer brain that runs the thing and has to do so efficiently without too much price separation chaos is it even i think what i'm trying to say here is incrementalism itself is somewhat unproven concept in terms of adding on additional market services and it's unclear to me how much optionality is actually inside of that yeah thanks and i want to try to attempt to answer sarah's question and in that like i think from our view um having at the at the end product is functions managed by different organizations you're not optimizing the efficiency of what you're getting it's sort of like throughout our economy why there's bundling of insurance products you get the full product at a at a more reasonable cost from x y and z because they offer all three of these things versus you know i mean that's just the economic view of it i also think um this term incrementalism has been used uh in a negative way and people are now being put in buckets are you an incrementalist or are you a you but i think ultimately the way you define it really matters in that are you talk you know if if you're talking about we're incrementally getting to some some steps and then when you say sufficient incrementalism like we're going to get edam or we're going to get to a resource adequacy piece and that's good enough for our organization that is not good enough for the region that might be good enough for specific organizations but i'm hoping that the conversation around getting to the final is is looked at in the light of what is best for all of the for the entire region not what is best for x y and z entity so the full benefits of what we come to need to outweigh the benefits that any one individual participant in this could receive thank you for that feedback let's go to commissioner tawny and then to robbie a layer i would add to this conversation is there are constraints that are part of why we have ended up in the in the whatever this current approach is this incremental approach and those constraints don't because we've decided we want an rto and the constraints that particularly i think have driven us into the in down this current path the sort of the way california moved 20 years ago and set up or 25 years ago and set up through legislation the cal iso and a different reliability mechanism their ra mechanism is invested in the california energy commission not in the kaiso although of course there's deep interlacing you know we we may get to we may get to passing legislation to shift governance of the kaiso maybe maybe not but it seems highly unlikely they will change their ra and so incorporate them in the dispatch to take advantage of all the solar that they want to send out on a daily basis and all of their investment they're making in batteries we have to we will face a real challenge if we try to bring both the ra construct and a market construct together because we'll not have to not only just have to change their governance of their market we'll have to change their governance of their ra which isn't even on the table right now and it's pretty hard to imagine the second constraint that i think has sort of pushed us into this is bpa's existence existence that isn't gonna sort of change and go away and is to require constant sort of with and around because they are the backbone of the transmission infrastructure and that's that's okay that brings a lot of value to customers as well but i'm not sure that because of those two pre-existing conditions amongst many others those two seem particularly to fundamentally change to make a west wide rto possible and so you're then always left with well what am i going to give up then do i give up the dispatch with california so that i can have everything under one roof do i give up uh something else so that i've got bpa at the table because they're such an important player and so i i think we um just sort of inherently in here in don't sort of there isn't a sort of perfect rto that we're comparing to we're comparing to sort of the art of the possible given the existing landscape we're operating in and so i my i'm always sort of well then what's the cost benefit trade-off for customers this is a route to accomplish the state's goals at lower cost it doesn't automatically decarbonize the grid but it creates some some optimizations that really reduce the cost of optimizing the grid and so to the degree that i can enable as a regulator for customers then then i want to do that in whatever small role we play as the regulators in this conversation let me just leave it there but i i think we have to be careful about holding out a perfect rto as a as a possibility or an eastern style maybe the way to put it in eastern style rto because we aren't starting with a blank slate thank you for that feedback uh we'll go to robbie next and uh just one note if any members of the public again have interest in making a comment please use the race hand function and we will make sure there's time for you thank you adam and and thank you commissioner uh you you kind of hit it uh right on the on the spot and and i and i couldn't agree more with what you just said um i wanted to clarify a little bit about when i used the term september 20th session and i i didn't really mean that you replaced rq with an incremental approach like we have today i think what i was trying to say is that you know northwest has always been a very unique region in itself uh as commissioner tony you provide said you know bonneville a utility that owns and operates almost 70 percent of the high voltage transmission um in the region it's hard to get around and and be able to get everything that probably an rto requires for non-jurisdiction entities bonneville to be part of it there are statutory limitations and and other legalities that i'm probably not the best suited person to talk about but if you look at the history um we had to it took us about four years just to form a regional planning organization northern grid and that's just one functionality of many that an rto serves when i said incremental was was to build a trustworthy relationship across the footprint amongst multiple stakeholders which an rpo as northern grid did do the western ra program is getting us there the ein with announcing that they will be joining in all those are incremental steps that moves us probably closer to an rto construct it doesn't take us directly to an rto but it builds a pathway to get to and eventually maybe to an rto whether that rto will be sort of a i'll just use it for the discussion purposes here a northless power pool sort of a footprint rto or whether it'll be a west wide rto for the reasons that you mentioned about the uh you know western interconnection rtu i think the same challenges and questions are have been existing in in my mind particularly and probably might be shared uh with several other members at",

        "text": " this says shall rezone to this classification. So that is why staff supports may be eligible. So that is okay, that's fine. But now I want to get back down to the meat and potatoes of it, which is, this clearly states this is appropriate for commercial parcels located in the rural lands. Correct. Undeveloped commercial parcels. Right. I don't understand where we're getting, where we are getting agricultural parcels confused with this, but it's because it's ambiguous on those. It doesn't say who can or cannot apply. Whereas in 1996 it was clear you were one of the bees and you had rural land use, you could apply for this. Well, that's exactly what it says up there. It doesn't reference the non commercial properties at all. Correct. That's when you get into the intent and the plain language of the language before that about agriculture related commercial uses. Doesn't that also, it just says, doesn't that add to the confusion about the confusion about the rural land designation allows for limited agriculture commercial uses. Correct. Which is why that first sentence also matters, right? Yes. It's all one intent, but then gives all the permitted uses. It's ambiguous about. Right. So that first sentence is a problem also. No, because you're talking about a use, not zoning. So your uses are like your permitted uses here. So it's not talking about land use. So that would be referring to the items in b, permitted uses. All right, let's finish with your presentation. And that's where we go back to the land use designation. So next we would be getting into the language proposals, and that's the eleven by 17. So we have the intent, which is very similar to what we've been talking about. And here you have the applicant on the left, which is asking to include limited agriculture related uses that would be appropriate on rural lands not located within the rural activity center. And their wording is only undeveloped parcels located within the rural lands with an existing commercial zoning classification may be eligible to rezone to this classification and must do so prior to applying for development approval. And agriculturally zoned parcels shall not be rezoned to this classification. LDRC and staff supports the applicant's proposal. LDRC has proposed that they've included the limited to the agricultural related commercial uses that would be appropriate on rural lands not located within a rural activity center. Then, they say all undeveloped parcels located in the rural lands may be eligible to rezone to this classification and must do so prior to applying for development approval. They've scratched the last sentence about agricultural lands or agricultural zone property. And just to be clear, should that language be taken out, they would have the process of going through a comp plan amendment and a zoning change to develop their property. That is correct. So we would not be taking away any landowners rights to develop their property. It's just the zoning process of which they would move forward with? That is correct. And it's a land use application, is not. It can be as limited or as difficult as you want. We have had many applications that come in that are three pages long, and it's just simply, here's my parcel number, the size, my current land use, what I want, and here's my property description. So you know where it is and how big it is. Or you can do a market study and everything else to show there's a need for this type of use here. And here's how we fit in. Then we get into using this key for reference. This asterisk here is the tell you that these uses are in the RAC zoning classification, and the little arrow tells you that it was added in 2017. The staff, the applicant, and the LDRC have agreed on several things one would be the removal of bait and tackle sporting goods bank, credit union and financial loan institutions. The applicant is asking to remove bottled gas and cylinder refilling whereas the LDRC said that that could be an accessory used to a hardware store which if hardware stores were to remain in this zoning classification that would make sense. But you have hardware stores are also available in your racs. Both agreed to move church to the special use permit. The applicant has asked to strike convenience store and gas stations because of their commercial. Their commercial use and staff has supported that because staff believes that is in conflict with the rural land use designation and it should have some kind of either rural activity center or commercial land use to support that gas station. Whereas the LDRC, they said keep convenient store gas stations no drive thru with a maximum of 4000 square foot for the actual convenience store building and six fueling stations. Both agreed on removing the dude ranch and agreed on removing the manufacturing and installation portion of farm storage structures. Both agreed on removing the gun store which that is allowed in the rural activity center. And then they had a discrepancy on the hardware store. Whereas the applicant and staff supported removing the hardware store because it is available in the RAC LDRC said keep it but a maximum of 4000 square foot and the horse trailers and farm wagons removing the manufacturing portion of that so they can still do repair and sales of those striking of the professional office was agreed. Removing of commercial vehicles parking those were added to the special use permits. Removing of the landscape contractors yard because. Yes. And can you explain to me what a landscape contractors yards. What is that? That is the yard where there's piles of rock. There's the pavers and other equipment used for landscape design and installation. So it could include some vehicles, some commercial vehicles and moving of heavy equipment but little pebbles to go around. Flower beds. Pavers you said, right. So we're talking about the large, the large in bulk not what you would get at like Ace hardware or something like that. In a bag. Like the two pound bag. Thank you. Okay. And then the applicant and staff supported removing restaurants because they are available in the rural activity centers and in the regular commercial zoning. There's the LDRC recommended no drive thrus and limit them to 4000 square foot. And that's the extent of the permitted uses in the special use permits. There was mostly agreement with the removal of the construction and contractors yard which includes a lot of heavy equipment and bulk materials. The removal of the kennel and removal of the sports facility which includes tennis, archery, racquetball facility and Orlando swimming club facility and then in the water supply treatment. It was just to clarify that there's 15 or more service connections or commercial buildings that would be required. A special use permit. Those are the permitted and special use permits from the applicant and staff. And then from Land development or land development regulation committee. The applicant who. This is their application. They are here. They would like to speak to you. Absolutely. We will call them up in just a few moments. But because staff supports this, we're going to also make sure that we understand your position on this as well. That's okay. Do you have any other questions? Board for Mister Rayrock before we call the applicant up. Thank you, sir. All right, the applicant. Mister Brockway, I see you in the audience and team. Thank you, madam chair. Matt Brockway, icard Merrill, 23 Main street, Sarasota, Florida. Here on behalf of the applicant. Horse farms forever. Also have with me van Linkus. Hi, Evangeline Linkus. I'm the director of urban regional planning at the University of South Florida, 4202 East Fellae, Tampa. First off, Mister Weirach did a great job explaining all of the details and history of this zoning classification. It's a lot to digest in a very short time. Even though this is the second reading, we really started our deep dive into this zoning classification probably five months before the application was filed. So we've been living this for a long time and recognize that it's a. It's a lot to swallow, and there's a very steep learning curve. So, an important component of horse farms forever mission is to avoid future land use conflicts. And the quintessential example of what we're trying to prevent is the conflict we had last, almost a month ago to the day on March 19, when an agriculturally zoned property was heard for a rezoning to the RC one zoning district. Now, in the comments that Commissioner Bryant made a few minutes ago, if you look at the 1996 intent statement, it's clear what was intended for the RC one zoning district. It was to amortize and bring these legacy commercial parcels into alignment with the comprehensive plan. That language changed in 2017. So the goal of our amendment is to bring the intent back to what it was originally in 1996, and realign the intent and the uses with the comprehensive plan, and hopefully avoid future land use conflicts in doing so, in clarifying the rights of property owners, and the process going forward to achieve certain commercial land uses going forward. One analogy I came up with is some mechanism you find in sign ordinances. If you have a nonconforming sign, a lot of times there is a provision in that sign ordinance that you have to amortize those nonconformities over a period of time. So eventually all of the signs in the county meet and comply with the sign code. That's what the RC one zoning district was intended to. It was intended to amortize those legacy commercial parcels and bring them back into compliance with the comprehensive plan. Now, I think that the 1996 language, and even today's language is clear that it's intended only for those legacy commercial parcels to go to RC one to develop those agriculturally related commercial uses, which that's a discussion unto itself. But, and the principle is the inclusion of one implies the exclusion of the other. You're",

planner and now he's I think Community Development is just above planning right you're you it encompasses planning building planning building right yeah so he's he's he used to be in The Fray with us at least but Eric's our fearless leader playing get him Erica Palmer plenty manager okay yeah and welcome to the new Commissioners we'll have a formal introduction at our first hearing if I get it right on the agenda so process and then I was hoping to see me before we leave we could do just a quick what to expect at the next meeting because we'll have a public experience this is an informal process so it's a work session everybody can ask and answer questions as as the topics come up and then we'll get to the formal period process we have two hearings two hearings next maybe so we'll just give you a little wrap down before we leave tonight if you have any questions about it so all right all right yes so this evening we're going to talk about a updated refinement to our economic opportunities analysis and I have some extra hard copies here let's introduce ourselves do it again formerly Vice chairman commissioner all right this is Tyler Barnes Lawrence is uh new commissioner number one so no one knows anything about either of the new commissioners Erica I was just about to start our economic opportunities yes Redemption so I have some hard copies here if anybody needs a hard copy okay it's like we're all good I'm going to share my screen here hold on one oh yeah I'll read that just for you thank you if you have a background 101 on how this whole thing to our community yes I do here yep that is I just need to wait there we go there we are the magic the magic of the screen sharing um live streaming I know so yes tonight we're going to be talking uh about a little refinement to our economic opportunities analysis uh our last economic opportunities analysis was adopted in 2021 um and it was adopted as part of um the city's comprehensive Plan update um tonight I'm gonna talk a little bit about the state requirements for an eoa I'm going to talk about what has changed from our last eoa the three major things that have changed from the last video way I'm just going to give them away here really quick is our employment growth forecast and then our forecast for our land um our land forecast um needed needed employment and then also our buildable lands inventory has been updated um so next at our next meeting on April 25th we'll have a hearing um on the subject and the Planning Commission will make a recommendation to so whether or not to approve this document or approve it with modifications or just to deny it um so what is Goldmine so I I've already talked a little bit about our state plan use system with our community planning Commissioners we have 19 Statewide planning goals um and how our comprehensive plans for cities and counties need to address all applicable planning goals that relate to you know their cities and counties we have 12 Statewide planning goals that are applicable to Sherwood and goal nine um in the Statewide planning goals section is is talks about Economic and um what we really need to do is cities and counties we need to provide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of employment jobs to you know create um you know a vital communities for the health welfare and prosperity of our citizens people new jobs people need to need to work at least we hope they do please so what exactly is an eoa so um it's comprised of several different uh topic areas uh one of the first topics is that that we look at an economic difference nationally um even at the local level and then we do a jobs forecast and that jobs forecast is uh how many jobs will sure would likely create like over the next 20 years and then we talk about uh what kind of Industries we want to um because different employers they have different land needs so if you if so for example if you want a large semiconductor industry to you know to move into Sherwood and start that kind of business here they might need you know a 100 Acre parcel for their development unlike you know McDonald's that you may need like half an acre for their development and then uh we do an inventory of land for employment so we we take it it's really what is our supply of land here in Sherwood so if you look at the map and we categorize all of our Parcels what's already developed what's vacant uh what Parcels are have constraints because we have to take out those constraints that can't be developed on such as you know Wetlands um slopes over a certain percentage um our floodplain areas so we have to take all that land out of the inventory because that can't be built on and then we get to a number of you know how many acres are buildable um for employment here in Sherwood and then um based on all of that information um we reconcile our job growth with how much land Supply we have in Sherwood and we might have an oversupply or we might have a deficit um of land for job needs and we're going to go over all that information here in just a second and then we may or may not want to you know formulate new goals and policies but you know within the past two years and um even with this refinement there isn't really any need to develop anymore you know new policies per se but we can have that conversation if you feel like there's some information that's come out of this refinement that we might need to create a new policy for we can talk about that in the process of changing that in the future so as I said what's being refined in the ceoa so we've we took a look at the economic Trends and how those have been shaping up since the um eoa update listed and we we listed the target Industries but we haven't necessarily changed them from the last VOA we are um we're going to talk about those Target Industries here in a minute but those really haven't had they haven't changed since the last um but we then we took a look at our employment land needs and our projected demand for um land in the future and our growth rate which has changed and then our bli our buildable lands inventory that has and then like I said we do that reconciliation between our buildable lands inventory how much land we have that can be developed and then our future growth projected rate for deficit of land or maybe an oversupply so the economic Trends in this report the report touches on gross domestic um and I'm not going to get into all the details because I'm sure that you've read the report um gross and domestic product is just one way to measure you know National Trends and um also in the report it touches on we've seen a growth of online shopping you know definitely with the rise of you know Amazon and we've seen increased automation happening and I once again I just want to go back to Amazon with online shopping and automation because you have that software app on your phone you click it you click that product that you want there maybe in their warehouse some robot like goes down the aisle accept your toilet paper everybody needs toilet paper and drops it in a box and then there you know maybe somebody you know over at the end of that process to make sure it's on the conveyor belt and mailed out so that's yeah one whole process that shows you know online shopping Automation and um kind of been decreasing decreasing you know job with automation but regionally this area the metro area we have outperformed the nation um as well as the state of Oregon over the last decade in in certain job categories so our strengths here in the metro area have been in construction professional business services manufacturing warehousing and transportation and I just want to say that um all of these uses of construction manufacturing warehousing Transportation are all major drivers the industrial land demand so we're seeing that here in the metro area in Washington County we've seen robust employment here in Washington County and that remains consistent with the metro area as we're part of the metro area and then Sherwood locally uh we have outperform Washington County um in terms of growth over the last decade so the employment base in um grew at an average growth rate of 3.8 from 2010 to 2019 that was prior to the um but we're still kind of seeing that that growth rate still occur with the but the new businesses and the new developments that we're seeing in in Sherwood especially in the Tonkin employment area so we've seen um growth in trades constructions and Food Service and Health Care those are kind of the major sectors that we're seeing growth in here in Sherwood but wages in Sherwood are lower than the county we do have a younger Workforce and that's because a lot of the jobs here in Sherwood are you know kind of those service industry based jobs we have a lot of like retailers here in Sherwood questions clarifying this clarify I think what you're trying to say that the jobs that are available in Sherwood are lower than the rest of the county because the workforce in Sherwood the wages that people realize that work here are higher because we either are working remotely or leaving to go so I think the slide is confusing when you do the presentation is specifically related to the jobs that are based in Sherwood without the employees that are it sure would so I think if yes so I think I can clarify that for presentation presentations I've never heard in presentation before that the citizens of Sherwood's um no so the median household incomes in Sherwood or higher than the county and at the regional level right right yeah so yeah yeah for clarification and definitely make that change is only based on land base does it take into account any remote workers or any that it's hard to capture that I mean it's probably probably not unless they're actually operating their own business out of their home um but if they're working for Nike but now everyone's doing remote you know that that job is going to be settled in Beaverton right still so yeah it's hard to capture it's like we don't have a census data point or upholding census or anything that helps it would be interesting it would be interesting I agree I don't know if we the next time would be some sort of housing",

        "text": " difference in issues or the issues that both small and large projects face in terms of interconnection transmission and then also uh the community outreach and engagement piece of it and making sure stakeholders have an equal Voice or a sufficient time to interact those are cross-cutting between those two so I just wanted to add a couple more thoughts on that thank you thank you this is a varsi grill I just have a question so I don't know so one of the things that I know we get pressured with from the public is we didn't have time to review we didn't have enough time to look and we so as you offer those comments I'm just curious if local processes have you know such structured requirements we have very specific ones that were mandated to do and many of you could comment on that I'd just be curious so generally renewable energy applications go through a conditioned use process there is a department of land conservation development lcdc administrative rules for solar projects and the exclusive Army zones and for wind that are specific and they do have um specific criteria for redoing those applications but my experience is is that you get one bite of the app through a conditional use application process and if you don't like it uh you don't get many as many opportunities um to review an occupation or the intricacies of an application as you do through the f-sec process and the elements of the second process and working more comprehensive um and their intended to be uh I think that's very relevant for large-scale operations um and um It's You Know A system that we have for the upside process is based on standards and you're required to meet certain standards where a conditional use allocation is based on compatibility is it compatible and so I think there's a kind of a different way of looking at applications at the local level um I do think Kent's point about the appeals process at the local level where you go through kind of language board of appeals and then you go through the court of appeals and then you eventually can get to the organ Supreme Court or our process you if you have an appeal and goes into the Supreme Court there is the contestant case process in our process which refines the evaluation and the issues that are raised and we've if we observed how that's worked with transmission lines and uh I think that's been very valuable to go through that process and sort out the issues and the parties and so we're a political well that wouldn't thank you yeah it turned around I do think each county is different some counties have very explicit standards for renewable development I think the standards for example in Crook County almost paralleled we have said language though we don't have standards or some um and I also think there's that I wanted to Kathy the local decision body um they're too involved in the community that's most affected so um while absec has hearings where there are projects proposed I think with the local processors sometimes have more Community involved with because it's the decision makers that she appointed but um I think we had one appeal in Clinton County that's probably three years into feels back again so each project is so different and it's hard to design any one system to reflect all those differences so but again thank you to Verde and the other participants for taking this on and doing the soul searching we do need to do but there's a reason there are these two different processes both at the state level reflecting the broader State interests and then the local conditional use process yeah I think it brings up a good point while there are lcdc rules for renewable applications not all jurisdictions have adopted those groups and so there is a lot of variability between County review allocations a review of applications so I think counties can always be more stringent than the state world so dritos thank you honey thank you for the so you know if you kind of throughout this process you know I've heard a lot of the conversations you know State versus local board offensive um takes more time yes on its face but you need to dig deeper into that because that's a very generic sort of statement and it kind of goes exactly what's being said here today is what you can't just sort of say one is more expensive than the other you know you have to look into what the standards require what the process is required that's where I think the evaluation to go to to say is this needed for these projects and that's a legitimate conversation but you can't just say it's harder here and it's easier here and so but that's where oftentimes the the conversation stops and that's a misrepresentation uh very much of exactly the differences between the two processes you can compare you know uh something that one County does on cultural resources versus what the council does they are completely okay I may not do hardly anything related to cultural resources you know or you know subsurface archaeological resources we have a significant process related to that so again you need to dig deeper you can't just say these things on a surface level because that creates a false I think reality of what it is and yeah the last thing I would say is you know probably just because solar is really what we're seeing most there's going to be a little bit of wind but it's really solar you know and again the sort of Need for these facilities totally agree with that but I just want to kind of reiterate where we're at as fsec so operational there's 50 megawatts of f-sec approved project being a solar project that is in operation 362 megawatts is in construction 812 has been approved but has not yet been getting construction three of those have requested time extensions because they've indicated there's no power purchase agreement for their facility and 2.5 gigawatts under review of solar so again these are needed you know and when people talk about the the need for projects in the future I totally agree with that but you need to look at how much our currently under review you know either by us or by the local governments and I would encourage everybody you know on this ball to look at the land conservation development commission Department Forest report because that gives an assessment across you know not just fsec but across the local governments about the number of projects uh solar wind others that have been improved I think that helps frame up you know what we need to do to move forward um in addition to what it is right now or what's what's available to to build right now thank you other comments I would just like to say that I have um in my day job um we're trying for the ibw I've participated some of these calls in a conversation that has been Fascinating People are engaged they're kind of from different perspectives the one thing I'm still not completely sure is what the interface and how I'm gave to the Public Utility Commission has been because when we start talking about transmission um obviously the investor own utilities have their integrated resource plans and it goes into like a whole other Rabbit Hole of things are they participating with you orianna chair Grail the Public Utility Commission uh did come and give a presentation about how the resource planning process works um they have indicated uh that they want to be a little bit less involved for two reasons one that they're deferring to uh the department of energy uh for the most part and feel like Department of energy will tag them in or indicate that they should start participating if things come up uh that feel like they fall more within Public Utility Commission purview and also because there have been a number of proceedings at the Public Utility Commission um related to the the condemnation docket or or now related to Boardman to Hemingway that have felt like the commission would like to have a little bit of arms links to this particular public process in order to protect the Integrity of that particular space as um and ensuring that they have the right venues and that there are not um questions that are coming up or or comments that are coming up that feel like that may be influencing that process so uh that's been a factor as well is that there are concurrent things but we're in close conversation with the Public Utility Commission regularly and keeping them updated as a I believe the department of energy is as well thank you any other comments or questions well then we thank you all for your participation today in providing us information I think it will be helpful for us as we continue our work and we look forward to collaborating in the future thank you all right well we are ready to move on if you all you know welcome to stay at the public meeting habit but we're going to continue on with our agenda item we've already taken a quick break so I think we'll continue moving past that and that gets us to our public comment period this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed or common items closed for Comic include the Western solar project for our proposed order the Nolan Hills wind power project proposed order and the protected areas Scenic resources and recreation resources standards rulemaking The Time Is Now 10 35 and we are opening public comment Nancy do we have anyone wishing to come or is there anyone in the room wishing to comment of the state of any comment click on that icon and when you're speaking we can include all the iconic events with the lawyer yeah to make the comments and start to bring to the lower Journey on strategy thank you so if you wish to make any comments please let Nancy know in the way that she's just described her if anyone in the room wishes to do so please complete a card indicating so during this time I do not see any thank you all right so we have a call interview services hello council members this is Max yaclik in-house counsel for Nissan energy and I just wanted to add a little bit of the developers perspective to the conversation that was just had and we've been participating in that policy work group with orianna and everyone and are very thankful for all the work that has been done there but just in response to uh director cornett's comment about looking at the the amount of energy that's been um applied for at f-sec um Mike McArthur mentioned that the projected need to build meet h321 is is somewhere approaching approaching 50 gigawatts so you know the 2.5 gigawatts that have been currently approved is is far below what what we need and I just also want to reiterate that as we're looking at that element that we also need to consider the projects that are approved",

We don't want four wheelers going by and scaring the horses or tearing up our peace of mind. It's just that it's totally incompatible with the area that's been there for years. I've been there 52 years. And I know when somebody lived where mirror is living now. They had a dirt bike and they went tearing up and down the road and scaring all the animals and there wasn't anything we could do about it because they were in the community. But we don't. We shouldn't have to put up with how many. Twelve, almost 2000 people wanting to come down. We've got the trees, we've got the oak trees, we've got the shade, we've got the animals. They're going to want to come down there and access our road and our property and I don't think that's fair. Have you considered posting a sign? Private property? It doesn't work. We've already had somebody come down. I'm just asking the question. And park on our property to walk their. Well, turn their dogs loose. Actually, they didn't even walk them. They just turned them loose and they said, well, this is a public road. Well, it's not, but you can't convince them of that. You may want to post a sign all the same so people will know. Do you have anything else to add, Miss Dale? No, but a sign's not going to keep them out. It is private property. It is. So can we have them arrested when they come down there? What exactly can we do? Absolutely. If you've got a no trespassing, you absolutely can call and say someone is on your property. What about saying it's a private road? That is totally up to you. It's private property. You're welcome to put up what you want. Okay. It's our easement. It's private property. Thank you. Thank you very much. Behind that we have Karen Arman and Tim Gantt. I've seen Karen. She's here. Tim Gantt. And behind that we have Brian Donnelly. Erin Armond. 22 34 northeast 6th place of Calif. I guess at this point, the way I'm seeing it is since we own our homes, you guys are kind of like our landlords and. Yeah, because you are taking away the quality of our lives in our areas in order to provide for other people. But you aren't taking in consideration what it's doing to us, what it's doing to the property around us, what it's doing to the traffic. I mean, if there's your address. I did. Thank you. Want it again? Okay. I just didn't hear her give it. I'm just confirming. Thank you. Okay, so thanks for confusing me. You guys are good at that. But the thing is, it's the same as landlord tenant rules. I mean, us as homeowners should have some kind of right. And even though you're the government entity running this county, you are therefore our landlord. And I find that you are not following statutes 83.64. We are entitled to a quality of life. We are entitled to quiet, to an area where we can enjoy our outdoors. We are entitled to not smell fire day after day after day. We are entitled to not hear heavy machinery, machinery at 530 in the morning, although they'll tell you they're there at seven. And this goes on day after day after day. And after point grand is done, then we have calibrex. We get no relief from any of this noise, from any of the trucks tearing up the sidewalks, the curbs. The place in front of the church is reduced. Ridiculous. Miss Armon, if you'll please wrap your comments. I'll wrap it up. You're our landlords and you're failing. Thank you, Miss Armon. Behind Mister Donnelly, we have Allison Scotty. Mister Donnelly, Brian Donnelly. 7337 West Anthony Road, Ocala, Florida 34479. I do not live anywhere around this development. I know it's approved. I know there's very little that you're able to do for Miss Korber. She's a dear friend of mine. So I'd like to pose maybe a strange solution to this in exchange for a couple things, like a gate, maybe some signage removal. I bet you can take Miss Korber and have her be a brand ambassador for Calibrex. Instead of having a pissed off neighbor who is upset all the time. She could be Calibrex's biggest supporter with very little trouble to them. I leave it to you to talk to them and see what they're willing to do to assuage the neighbors in a very fundamental, inexpensive way. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Donnelly. And behind Miss Scotty, we have Gail Stern. And behind Miss Stern we have Jonathan Rivera. Rose, I'm sorry. You go right ahead, Miss Scotty. Allison Scotty. 6765 Northwest 14th Avenue. And like Mister Donnelly, I do not live near this area. However, I am an equestrian, a horse farm owner, and I can really sympathize with the residents near this development. I understand it's already been approved. I do. I am concerned, however, about our reputation as the horse capital of the world, both as an equestrian and, I will confess, as a real estate agent. So I just respectfully ask that you seriously consider and approve the citizens alternative conceptual plan that they've submitted. Thank you very much. Thank you. Behind Mister Rivera Rose. Katherine Gandy. Hi, Jonathan Rivera Rose. 9281 West Anthony Road, Ocala. I too am a friend of Miss Korber's. And like Mister Donnelly, I think they have a great solution. The citizens have proposed a great solution. It is a better design than was presented. It saves on costs. Saves on building costs. Makes much more sense. And like Mister Donnelly, I think you would have a. Instead of having angry neighbors, you would have neighbors that recognize that the developer actually stood up, the county actually stood up and tried to protect the peace, the welfare of the community, as opposed to just of the developer. That's all I have to say. Thank you, sir. Behind Miss Gandy we have Ginny Valner. My name is Katherine Gandy. I live at 10410, 105th Street, Ocala, Florida 34481. I guess I'm an animal lover. And the people, my heart breaks for them. I just. I can't stand the idea that here we've lived all these years here and we're not important. That's the main thing. They need some kind of compassion from everybody here. I think it all can be fixed with just a little bit of talk and to them and do just a little bit of what they need. Thank you very much. Thank you. Miss Gandy. Was Judy Volner here? Judy Etzler. And behind Miss Edzler, Sharon Foucault. Fusco. Excuse me? Fusco. Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, commissioners. It's nice to see you again. Okay. Judy Etzler. 52 51 Northwest 219th Street Road, unincorporated Marion County, 32667. That sounds like I live in the middle of New York City. I work there. So I know, and I just want to say that I am in support of and please approve the Citizens alternate conceptual plan. They went to a great deal of time and effort and it looks like that they would be happy with it and they would be happy neighbors to this development. So that's all I have to say and I'll keep it short. Thank you. Appreciate. Good to see you. Behind Miss Fusco, Renee Michael. Hi, Sharon Fusco. 6021 West Anthony Road, Ocala, Florida 34479. Just coming up here to express my appreciation for you being able to listen to these concerns of the citizens. We do live in a county that seems to be developing at a very quick pace. And I do think that there's real concern for the agricultural areas that are trying to keep away a life that is rapidly disappearing. So again, just please consider the citizens proposal and try to find a good middle ground so that they can live in harmony with the development. Thank you very much. Thank you. And again, Renee, Michael, that is all that I have signed up to speak to this particular item. I will open it. Is there anyone else who'd like to come forward and address the master plan for Aurora Oaks? If so, please come forward now. I see one, maybe two. And anyone else? I'm inviting you to come forward now. Yes, ma'am. Michelle Shearer, 2301 Southeast 85th Street, Ocala, Florida. I used to actually live right across from sumpter electric, right down from this property, actually. I used to ride my horse in Atwoods",

        "text": "ready well welcome everyone and I see we've got um well over 30 folks online it looks like so a full meeting unfortunately with the group decides we can't do introductions I don't think we only have an hour here to get through our agenda so um I will note that the agenda does include public comment uh so if folks are joining and want to make any comments to the council you'll have that opportunity it's on the agenda um to start um I'll ouce myself my name is Andrew spreadborough and with neighbor impact we're a um Community Action Agency uh located in Central Oregon cck to shuts and Jefferson counties and we're a community heat pump program recipient for our region and I am the chair of this Council elected by my peers appreciate that everyone um the agenda today we have a few items uh in case you don't have it in front of you we're going to start by doing a bit of an overview of our active prog programs and each each council member will have an opportunity to introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their program uh what they're experiencing um we're going to then transition onto the department of energy staff to talk about program improvements rul making and legislative uh reporting requirements and then we'll wrap up with uh timing of our next meeting in public comment um so Department of energy staff do you want to introduce yourselves before we jump into the program updates or are there any other upfront welcome items that you want to share before we in um I can quickly introduce myself um with no other items so I think for us uh my name is James kogal I'm a policy analyst here at Odo I'll just hand it off to kayn hi I'm kayin Lynch I'm also a policy Analyst at Odo Patricia you want jump Patricia Phillips and I'm here to help with the webinar if you have any have any needs just let me know in the chat thank you and thanks Ina Patricia let me know if something pops into that chat chat that you think we need to be aware of feel free to jump in um last thing I'll note um is this is our first meeting so if we're a little bumpy and unsure of our process bear with us we'll we'll we'll try to refine this over time so again in the interest of kind of a a tight agenda I'd like to start by providing a opportunity for each uh council member to introduce themselves uh talk a little bit about your experience in implementing the community heat pump program um particularly if there are challenges or um opportunities uh information that might be useful to the group so um I'm just going to call on you guys um rather than wait for volunteers and I'll I'll just kind of work through in order I'll go last perhaps um but um let's start start with I think uh we have Molly from Earth advantage on Molly do you want to introduce yourselves and share a little bit of information about what you guys do and your geography and so forth sure uh can you hear me okay yes great um yep my name is Molly Hatfield I use she her pronouns and I'm the senior climate Justice program manager at Earth Advantage uh we are currently administering the Metro region The Mid Valley region and the South Valley Mid Coast region uh and the way that our program is set up um is we work through uh who we're calling installation Partners who are um either community- based organizations Community Action agencies uh local utilities local governments uh who are actually um in those areas who um do this work all this type of work already um and can stack these incentives um ideally on top of um other um other work that they are doing for uh priority communities so um we've set up a pretty uh intuitive form system around uh uh requesting Reser uh requesting rebate reservations um and then payments after the fact uh we do a lot of review of um documentation and paperwork and priority um I'm not quite sure what um specific information would be useful for folks around here so I'm happy to dive into more details around this um but perhaps I'll just leave it there and then if there's any particular element that um folks want to uh learn more about we can Circle back and I can um go into more detail thanks Molly I just have a quick follow-up question um are you providing only rebates um or do you do upfront grants or how do you structure the payments uh we do both um so it really does depend on our partner um we have most of our partners have chosen a rebate system where they will um request uh a reservation of funds uh do the project and then we um review the projects and reimburse after the fact uh we do have um currently just one partner who's doing the um advance system where uh they request a chunk of money up front uh and then as they uh deliver projects they reconcile those projects as they okay well thank you so let's keep moving through but yeah I'd like to also hold time if if we council members have questions for their peers about uh specific operational details this is your time to ask so don't don't be shy um okay next up on my list we have a mid Columbia uh Community Action Agency and Casey looks like you're on the call hello hello I'm Casey buckles I am actually the utility assistance program manager for our agency but um I wrote the grant for our very small weatherization team and uh I am the administrator for that Grant um at our agency um we do not have this run as um as a rebate program it is run in tandem with our other um weatherization grants um in our area we have a very high need for weatherization and very low funding we are the lowest funded Community Action Agency in the state we have a four year waiting list for weatherization so this um Grant actually helps us complete a couple a few more homes a year uh which is really really helpful our agency already targets the um EJ bipo um senior disabled you know all of the all of the priority category um households that are important for this grant um as a matter of of U our mission vision and values so that is you know kind of wrapped up in in what we do and also um households have to be lowincome in order to qualify so um we don't have an issue there with um eligibility so um we just we run it in tandem with that um and then when my weatherization program uh has a job that is um providing equipment that falls under the guidelines for the CHP program um he will you know allocate whatever the the grant um specifies for that unit so if it's a a lower efficiency lower end on the efficiency he'll do the 4,000 and we've had a couple that were um a lot higher and able to do the 7,000 recently so we had a pretty slow start um and then another slow quarter but I think to date we've completed about five different projects with that we also have extremely uh low contractor um engagement in this area so we fight that as well as funding and just for for context your region mid Colombia's um wasow Hood River and Sherman counties coun yeah it's identical to the service area for the grant that we're great okay well thank you Casey appreciate that overview and then we have uh Elena on the call as well uh from the Lake County resource initiative hi Elena good morning everyone can you hear me okay okay my microphone wasn't working my last meeting so I just want to make sure um Elena Coleman energy programs manager for Lake County resources initiative um we serve South Central Oregon which is clth and Lake counties um with this program oh my Yippy puppy in the background give me one second so sorry she was sleeping minute ago she's 12 weeks anyway um so we serve clth and Lake counties with this program um we also are partners of uh Community partner organization of Energy Trust of Oregon and so um we're able to serve Lake View proper with energy trust and most of clth County but unfortunately um Lake county is over 8,000 uh square miles and most of Lake County is um not Energy Trust territory it's Midstate or surprise Valley Co-op utility utility territories and so um we've been able to plug in with this program and serve some of those North Lake low-income residents with heat pumps um so far we've had 15 installations um we have a really good relationship with two contractors um that serve uh us with this program and we do a half down check so that they can you know acquire the equipment and then um the other half half after the Project's completed we've created some internal intake forms um we do have a partnership with uh two different organizations out the clouth county but we don't currently um get as many leads as we were hoping for from them um primarily um all of our programs at LCI are word of mouth and this Odo program has really taken off Word of Mouth we've put flyers up in some of the stores in North Lake and um so that's kind of how we've we've gained most of our leads but happy to be here and I appreciate it great thank you Elena and just to confirm once again we we still don't have anyone from confederated tribes of grand Rond on the call is that correct if you're on the call from the tribes please let us know okay um well I'll go next again I'm I'm with neighbor impact and we are Community Action Agency serving the central Oregon region Crook dutes and counties and um uh our our program is definitely underway we we launched in November and uh really focus upfront on our Outreach to the community uh through our our typical neighbor impact Outreach channels including Social Media newspapers um public meetings those sorts of things trying to get the word out um we operate the program as a grant and rebate program meaning it's dependent upon the applicant on what kind of scenario makes sense uh in our experience a rebate program is much more efficient and easier to manage however understanding our efforts to prioritize environmental justice communities our decision was to make Grant funds available as well for those folks that need that um incentive payment to make their Project work financially we wanted to make sure that those funds were available upfront and so to be honest a really large majority um of projects were Grant oriented meaning uh the applicant uh in partnership with their hbac company would apply jointly uh for funding we would make a conditional award uh enter into a a very brief agreement with the uh owner and the hbac company that laid out the kind of the terms on who's paying for what and how it all",

        "text": "I know I looked over this morning and everybody's over there on their laptop I was like I'm GNA pay attention to the audience over here who's listening int well we we are always listening CLA Harrington so welcome back to you well welcome back to our afternoon portion of the April 16th 2024 work session we have a few topics on the agenda for this afternoon and our first one has an outside guest speaker to catch us up on the great work being done by greater Portland in so please join us yes and you have the clicker as well oh perfect good yes you have the power hello good afternoon Monique Clayborn greater Portland Inc I'm the president and CEO of the region Economic Development organization I am here today to just present to you as an overview of the organization the work that we're doing um commissioner Willie is our it's your representative um and I just think it's important for me to Enlighten you as to what's going on U I know he has all the info but good to hear directly from the source as well too so thank you for having me so about GPI we're the only public private partnership dedicated to attracting businesses in the greater Portland region which also includes Southwest Washington first came on there were so many organizations doing similar work and so I created a VIN diagram which what you see here today and so it represents the other organizations that are doing pseudo work within um the ecosystem really illustrates uh greater Portland's role in being Southwest Washington as well as in Oregon um and representing both the public and private sectors so we are all about job creation and driving tangible Regional Prosperity at no cost um to those that are interested um those Trader sector businesses that are uh seeking um expansion within the greater Portland region and that's due to our membership base so we do work from project management to um connecting these companies to Providers and key assets uh Workforce Development EI resources Market visits and even securing incentives um at the state as well as at the local level the industries that we work in um are reflected here on this slide and so think about traded sectors it's different from small business or local business rather where local business is located in the region it's client base is in the region the revenue is in the region so you have the same dollars circulating within the region what's unique about traded sector is while it's located here Revenue it's coming from outside of the region and so that's bringing new dollars and pumping new dollars into the region and so um the companies that we work with are what the Portland reg is known for computers Electronics semiconductor apparel and outdoor right Nike uh Colombia uh we just worked on an expansion project which will be announced soon I'm not going to announce it it's was about to uh but Footwear on Footwear Footwear uh company um and you name it so our impact from last year Alone um our organization was responsible for bringing over 6 750 jobs um when I came in I said hey I want us to bring in 20,000 jobs by 2030 and um those 750 jobs estimated impact was over 100 million in direct income so those are taxable wages um over 300 million in sales and output for the region and then an additional 600 jobs for indirect jobs um we are mentioned in the media a lot or that was U one of my goals in the when I took over the position and so again you can just see um our comm's output right now uh we were involved in the semiconductor task force um and I co-chaired the credits and incentives committee um I wrote a number of different op-eds uh brought light to the state having just about $1 million in in cash grants available to semiconductor companies and we knew this the federal chips Act was in the pipeline right and that state and local government had to support that so again brought light to that and ultimately um my effort is it was a collective effort of course um $240 million in uh tax credits approved uh to 15 uh Oregan companies that were expanding within the semiconductor um sector and then this slide also just highlights again um how active we are with our current investors um are assisting um re uh organizations within the region and then again honoring those who've invested in a GPI for over 10 years as far as Washington County so GPI has led um the creation of 1600 jobs specifically within the county since 2017 about 30 13 different projects 125 jobs approximately for each project check um with the annual estimated impact of over 1100 indirect and induced jobs over a billion dollars in sales and output and over $300 million in taxable wages so I'll just take a couple of seconds and just let the slide um seek in seep in in terms of the the impact that we are having uh in the county here so we know the Portland region is a great region to be in um I come from Michigan I've been here seven years now and I can tell you being on the west coast Portland is the cheapest West Coast option right and so when you look at our comparison slide San Diego Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco region we are um the best Co the best value on the on the west coast um what also makes this region incredible is our Transit and infrastructure our utility infrastructure um when we have these large projects large industrial projects which um of great interest post pandemic um we've seen a flip in terms of uh demand for Office Space versus industrial space um our ability to have affordable and reliable electricity clean water Jack is here uh is important right and so these are some of the the attributes and advantages to be in here also the the culture right number one city for outdoor enthusiasts number one for inclusion nearly 40% um of employees identify as nonwhite and a perfect score for the lgbtq equality um standard but despite that we have these headlines right and I'm sure we all hear about it from friends and families from what the wasi journal recently reported to the New York Times LA Times you name it and so our initiatives uh primarily will be Regional promotion as well as coordination and Regional promotion we were just we were just allocated $2.5 million from the Oregon legislature to repair the reputation of the region to bring investment into Oregon and so we will be rolling out a campaign land of way more that will include search engine optimization to counter negative online words right so as people are searching like again we can we can be proactive in what comes up in search results public relations that could be a media blitz in New York City um with media capital and Publications um and digital advertising that you'll see on the L way more we can be hyper targeted and going after specific um end users Consultants within certain markets that we want to attract to the region business Outreach so a lot more outbound and inbound travel into the region high-profile media Partnerships so imagine we're on the cover of Forbes or Fortune about Lulu lemons expansion within greater Portland again social media present so going to decision makers on LinkedIn from ads to videos to blogs and then enhancing our websites Regional coordination um we can cue the video but again it's to convene our city Business Leaders um nonprofits organizations public sector as well um to just address challenges um and bring together opportunities for uh e e video May Lacy B look great she did look great you did great too and so we um again and and being um visible within within the community um believe that contribut to us uh successfully securing funds with the organ legislature so uh my presentation's over thank you for having me and I uh will leave it to ask answer any questions that you may have for me well first if we might Jerry is there anything in particular you want to bring forward or help us appreciate about the work that's been happening at GPI the last couple years well I think uh um under Monique's um arrival here in Portland um we they there have been plenty of challenges um of the five of us I think four of us were probably involved at some level with gpi's formation way back when I saw in the slide here that Wasington county has been a member since 2011 is that what I saw um and of course I was mayor of Hillsboro when that was all going on as well hills's been at the same level so um I've always been an advocate of uh the need for a regional economic development organizations such as GPI and I think uh uh certainly Co threw a couple of Curves at us at GPI just like at us and and I think Monique's doing a good job of kind of redefining what it is that we're doing as a region and U where we need to be going next because as you saw on the slides there's plenty of bad press out there as well that needs to be U combed and certainly Portland needs to take that on themselves as well so anyway no I think Monique I think you're doing a good job and I appreciate you coming out here today so um I've got a long history with GPI so it's good you I think one of the questions that uh we posed uh you'd asked us either last fall or the previous fall about the annual members event that happened and you were like where were you guys and I said well invitations matter and we didn't get an invite so I just wanted to me that if they continue to no I used to get an invite directly so um so make sure we all get invites you will get invites and I can tell you the invitation save the date is going out this week it's September so this is your invite it's 24th the avenue to 10:30 it's across from the convention center in Portland our keynote speaker is Katie Griggs the president of the Seattle Mariners and she will be talking about stadiums the skylines the sports Playbook and E Economic Development interesting do you accept the invitation so I have a question um thank you for being here and uh as I mentioned to you earlier I also have a history with GPI which is uh it's a good thing from my perspective it just I have a clear understanding but one thing that maybe everyone here doesn't know is that GPI holds the economic development District as well and the application there so you can can you talk just briefly about that work sure so there are 12 Economic Development districts in the state",

repute even um anyway and I know it had saloons and so forth the O the oprd the Oregon parks and Rex owns the store during my 25 years in Beville it's seen a lot of different managers and management styles come and go um but currently FB under the direction of the president Ben Williams who testified earlier today um the decision was made that buil needed a park a local Dock and a gang way added as an economic driver in order to promote and make the store profitable but um in the I don't know if I said this already but it's never been profitable in the 25 years I've been here and I'm not sure whether it is today or not but they have increased a lot of events by they're trying to make an in a major event center they have constant music events and Bingo and uh Taco Tuesday and all kinds of things which has really had an effect on us as far as the um constant use by the um excuse me I'm recovering from a cold and I've got asthma now too so I apologize for my voice anyway to accomplish the goal of increasing profit FB was allowed by Maran County to create a park by clear cutting the trees installing a 10-ft wide P concrete path picnic tables a park bench multiple signage stations and the commercial parking lot on our local access road okay if these things don't Define a park I don't know what does um our current enjoyment or our quiet enjoyment of our community changed drastically and immediately medely after the installation of these things and because but landing is located on the only Lo local access road to our private properties it must be kept open 24 hours a day and because there's no funding for Mar and county for maintenance or security we're left in the dangerous position of trying to police the area ourselves due to the visibility and easy access to our private property by visitors as well as heavy media prom motion by the FB we've had countless incidents of trespassing threats vandalism and theft our driveways are frequently blocked by visitors cars while they're at the store or the park while distracted parents are drinking wine during events at the store their small children are sometimes Crossing Beville Road then wandering around our Access Road eating ice cream while we're trying to pull in and out of our driveways intoxicated guests leaving the store following music events create an additional Hazard and the store even had its own IPA beers created um which kind of causes and it it sounds like a lot of fun but it makes additional Hazard because of the negative impact that intoxicated people wandering around the street and our properties and then maybe driving if they're a little they've had a few too many ipas that's kind of a problem um for not just us but hitting the road after drinking a lot um anyway and then heavy use of our private access road for which we're financially responsible to maintain because it's a non-count road um has just created an additional financial burden on us due to the heavy use by the public and it should be noted if maybe someone's brought this up I don't know but neither NE Mr Williams nor any of the FP board members actually live close enough to but landing to be adversely impacted by the negative impacts of their actions and decisions and the FB is once again asking your permission to take this ill-advised project to the next level with the addition of a gang way in public boat dock in extremely close proximity to our private homes and pre-existing boat docks which would not violate um State and County codes and I may have that wrong on which level of codes are being violated I my attorneys did a great job on that so that's all I'm going to say about that but it would also be extremely unsafe for many reasons and you think about intoxicated people now they've had a few at the store they're going to oh great idea let's go down to the boat dock so they fall off they're getting hurt um because use by the public is only going to significantly you know it's the if you build it they will come and so whose liability is this now we're the feeti owners of the property but the county allowed FB to build this there's no funding for policing um who liability who's going to be sued when someone's hurt a child Falls and um already for years since this has been done the concrete sidewalk is used as a skateboard ramp kids come skateboarding down it and it's fun to fly into the um are they going to see the if they try to sue me I'm going to direct them to the county or and the FB for the lawsuit because I it wasn't my idea I've been fighting this thing for years so I don't know if the County's thought this through I haven't heard anything can the friends are a um NGO 501c3 group do they have sufficient insurance and funds to handle the lawsuit if someone's injured has this been thought thought thought through by the county who seems to give it their full support I don't know this I'm just it's a rhetorical question for you to think about when you make your decision as to whether you're going to green light this um another thing I don't know if has it may have been brought up I'm not sure but the FB says oh there's a huge need in Beville to have this river access really I strongly disagree there's already plenty of access to for the public to access the river and a boat dock nearby we've got shampoo Park Boon fairy Marina and Rogers Landing all within quick at minutes access from bville so and they say well yeah but that's not free they might have to pay $3 for parking or whatever okay but you want to provide free access we're the ones paying the price as the adjacent Property Owners it's on our back and the fact that it's not only free access but it's open 24 hours a day so this really puts the burden on us as Property Owners thank I just have a couple more things to say sorry that's fine he thought you were done keep going I thought you were done no keep talking just a couple more things commissioner Cameron I know this I know you're tired of this and no one's more tired of than me no no no that's just what this is why we're here okay um oh for for reasons unknown to me even though I think Marian County Planning knows that there are numerous codes being violated but for some reason they keep looking past the code violations and I don't understand that they even allowed a waiver of um fb's $940 fee for the application as a gift in kind to FB and I don't think that's a good look for the count I think it seems a conflict of interest to me I don't think any other entity or private person who applied to the county for a permit to do something would oh here's a waiver go ahead well I would say this yeah we've waved all the building permits for Wildfire recovery people we do it okay so but how I don't understand I'm just stating the fact well that's good that's a good thing I think private that's a natural disaster this isn't a natural disaster they're trying to put something through that has a very negative impact on property owners and they didn't consult us or consider us or at all in this anyway um and the last thing I wanted to say is it's my understanding it's an applicant I keep going back to the medical it's this applies to doctors but it says above all Do no harm I think that's kind of relevant in this case because it seems to me it should be the applicant who has the burden of proving with a preponderance of evidence that all the standards and criteria are met but in this case they've not only failed to meet the burden they've been allowed to violate the public trust at every turn and we've been forced to live in fear every day um and and as I think um Scott mentioned we're kind of we don't even bother to call the sheriff anymore because and it's not their fault but they're overburdened and they have a staff shortage and it they can't get out here for an hour hour and a half we could be dead by then so we just do our best to handle it ourselves but we're not trained in police procedure and it's really frightening especially you know I'm I know Shay's Home Alone a lot and I am too and it's it's scary um so we ask that as our commissioners that you help to uphold the code and statute of Marian County and deny this application and I've taken enough of your time and I thank you very much thank you thank you it's good to see you again good to see you too okay our next person who signed up is uh Conrad Herold figure out how to shut this and Conrad you didn't check whether you were support or well opposing come I didn't understand the legal turn off no problem up here and introduce yourself yeah introduce yourself just your name and address for the record and just uh before um M Mr Herold uh introduce yourself before you do that I just want to let everybody know that we will will one way or another be done here at 11:45 um potentially one of the options is to recess the public hearing and continue but I I do know that we were we're going to be down at 11:45 okay",

        "text": "all right well it's a wednesday morning i hope that you're all excited to hear more about the community renewable energy grant my name is christy split i am the department of energy's government relations coordinator and i'll facilitate our conversation today i'm glad that so many of you are here to join us because i think this is a really exciting opportunity for oregon's communities including your community an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can support both planning and projects as we get started i hope you will take a minute and introduce yourself in the chat by sharing your name and any so our agenda for today is that we will go over the program for a few minutes and then we'll hear about a project example just to kind of get those creative juices flowing and then we will also talk through um the application process and take your so um one thing that we're really game with is you all going ahead and putting into your chat the chat any questions that you have as we're going any comments you have and then we can go ahead and grab those so that you don't lose them um in your mind we can go ahead and grab those when it gets time for the q a or if it's something that's really timely i'm happy to interject with a question or two if it makes sense so just know that use the chat and then the other thing is that you can use your hand raise function we'll talk about next slide um i know webex is sometimes it's maybe getting more familiar as time goes on but um but you might not be as familiar with webex as with some other um webinar platforms so i just wanted to make sure you knew how to use the chat and also how to raise your hand we've got here an example page i know my page looks black maybe yours looks white but but we think this is hopefully something that you're seeing on your end and you can see where the chat is where you can chat to everyone or you could chat to just me if you wanted to for example in the bottom right hand corner you can raise your hand there's two options one is you can click the smiley face icon down at the bottom and the very top option is a raised hand function we kind of joke we want to point it out because the raised hand icon is like kind of a mild colored this which doesn't really look like a raised hand so just know that that's that's what it is a little bit of a raised fist so that's to raise your hand there you can also click next to your name to raise your hand and if you do ask a question or make a comment then you can go ahead and lower your hand afterwards that'd be really helpful we have a big crowd today so hand management will be a struggle so thank you for making sure you lower your hand um i also just wanted to flag for folks that the meeting it will be recorded we'll post on our community renewable energy grant webpage so that you can look at look at it later or send it around to someone who misses anything like that so happy to see so many people introducing themselves in the chat that's great and then um the other thing that i will ask is if anybody has any questions about the agenda or about webex to raise your hand now as a test um and also you can go ahead and chat any questions that you might have as well look we have a raised hand it's so see i have to find a couple people have raised hands okay hopefully these will just speak or maybe you're just testing it out okay just testing it out great perfect thank you for doing that and uh lowering and raising very well done okay so um what i'm going to do now is hand over hand things over to rob delmar and james who are the certified smart people when it comes to this new program will help answer questions later too so rob i will switch the slide and let you take it all right um just checking audio can people hear me got a thumbs up thanks i know we do this a lot and it should be working buddy rob at least i can't hear you i don't know if others can i got one thumbs up yeah i'm getting a lot of i can hear oh you can hear rob it's just me i will figure out my audio thank you sorry rob all right well thank you christy and as she said my name is rob delmar and i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and house bill 2021 also known as the 100 clean energy for all bill establish the new community renewable energy grant the purpose of the program is to offset the costs of planning and developing community renewable energy support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs next slide please i think christy still can't hear me so i will type in there we go all right one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in oregon is that it's only open to public bodies so eligible applicants include tribes cities counties other public bodies and consumer-owned the bill excludes cities over 500 000 in which in oregon of course includes only and this exclusion was done in the recognition of the portland clean energy fund which can provide funding for similar types of projects within the city limits of portland next slide please maybe i can there we go okay maybe i'll all right um another feature of the program is the focus on community energy the bill establishes carve outs where 50 or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects and there's a second car about where 50 or more of the funds must go to primarily serve one or more qualifying communities next slide qualifying communities are defined within the within the statute and they include communities of color low-income tribal rural and coastal communities and other traditionally underrepresented communities in oregon next slide the bill also called for an advisory committee to work with oregon department of energy on program and now program implementation and this committee was instrumental in sharing on the ground experience with project development they helped us to write the rules um they are located in communities across oregon and continue to help us spread the word for the program and so the committee has been instrumental in putting this together and continues to to serve us well as the as the program next slide please since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very busy standing up the new in the summer of 2021 auto staff were assigned to the program and developed an implementation plan including operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency in september we recruited the stakeholder advisory committee to help guide the program design and support the that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on january 1st and those rules are now final the opportunity announcements for the program came out on march 7th next slide please now before we move on to the specific grant opportunities i'd like to walk through a project that eweb the eugene water and electric board completed a few years ago the city of eugene like much of western could be subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake as a utility that manages both electricity and water services e-web recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within eugene next slide please eweb can considered community resilience based on the rule of threes and that was in the first three days they would like to be able to provide access to drinking in the first three weeks they would like to re-power critical facilities and in the first three months they would like to restore the system for regular operation next slide please so as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project the project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the howard elementary school and added a battery storage system and a new potable water well on next slide please so the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system also provides value to the community in addition to the water and energy resilience the school benefits from energy bill savings and eweb is also able to use the batteries to provide grid services during their day-to-day operations next slide please this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served by the system during a power outage the battery storage units and they're shown at the bottom in black can be charged by the solar and natural gas generator assuming that generator is in the event of an earthquake the water well and critical loads within the school are shown in green and the switch shown at the main breaker towards the top is a safety feature and that ensures that this micro grid is isolated from the rest of e-web's distribution system and that's to protect linemen who are out working on disaster recovery and now that the program is up and running the agency has started to hire that will run the program from here um pandyan krishnaswami is on the line and is our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on program nuts and bolts and we'll take over the presentation from here thanks rob so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th and there were four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity and more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes uh with additional funds online applications are now open and we will only be accepting applications through the online application next slide please opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits the scoring criteria include topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice",

you do have this in in written form as well so this travel is not vacation it's part of my icma travels first I'll be traveling to Belgium for their uh country's local government conference actually celebrating 50 years of being an association during this time I'll be on a panel on community engagement with a focus on Transportation housing homelessness and Health and Human Services with an international um lens and focus from there I'll be tra traveling to Vamp in Alberta Canada for the Canadian local government managers conference where I will be facilitating a session on local government ethics and from there I will be flying to Palm Desert California and facilitating various sessions at the local government reimagine conference f with a focus on intelligence two memos that I would like to draw your attention to that um you will be in your inbox this week I mentioned one memo that was coming and that's last week the service level assessment so that will hit your inbox this week the second um email is an update on the collaborate collaborative process between the County and the cities of tiger and Beaverton and this is to develop a framework to advance our urban service alignment as identified in the urban uh planning area agreements and urban Services agreements between the city and county so watch for that memo with more inform urban service that and that once I send that memo then the cities of uh tiger and bton will also be communicating with their companies and if I might because I have forgotten to share this uh already a couple of times this week um I learned this is something that I'm hoping each of the agencies will just look into for appropriateness but if I understand it correctly the National Guard actually has a u service that they offer to municipalities and other agencies on cyber security testing who knew so that may be something you want to have your uh subject matter experts look at and see if that's something that might benefit us control t or and I don't know if uh the folks who run the bug I can't even remember what that oh Broadband users group uh if that's something that would be of service to them or to wacka yeah I um for Washington County Ann obber will uh follow up on that and there is an upcoming bug meeting the Broadband user group meeting uh in the next two weeks where Ann can also ask that question cool great Mr Anderson yes thank you Bor um we had a uh new decision come well it's not really a decision um there was a case fman versus wagon that you may have heard about in the news and this was a challenge to basically the uh State's election system uh there was a challenge to whether vote by mail and machine tap related voting procedures VI our process violates 14th Amendment the case has been primarily handled by uh the state and in the in case uh plaintiffs have lost every level on the issue of standing whether they could bring this case forward the case was um the petitioners or the plaintiff's petition for review by the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court today decided not to review that case so I just want to give you an update on that um we have one other case I'm just going to give you a brief report on and I'm going to expand more later in the hot sheet on and that's disability rights Oregon versus Washington County and wacka in that case uh Washington County as well as wacka filed a motion to dismiss we received the response from the plaintiffs in that case it's about 50 something pages long and we're reviewing it right now and um we'll share with you more when we have more to share and that's all I have to report thank all right thank you Diane taguchi Dennis Clean Water Services C J and good afternoon board to clean water services and we were really honored to be able to host the water caucus and I want to thank you the board for being there the team was sending me kind of blowby blow pictures because I was back in Denver um facilitating the water research um foundations rack committee and what I do there is we select the research the water research for this next year so I I'm really grateful that you were there and and that Hillsboro um South Hillsboro is amazing and and also what tiger is doing and and I thank you for acknowledging that and and just the difference that it makes here in Washington Camp it's pretty special but I really want to give a shout out to Tracy rainy Tracy made this happen um Joe G supported her and and the whole team of Clean Water Services really rallied to do that presentation and they they did such a fabulous job they even had them in uh safety vests and hard hats to to tour U The Rock Creek facility but it was really great to see them there um we had a great meeting with um Maria Pope and her team from Portland General Electric and we have some things that we're really excited to work with um PGE on um we're really looking at how do we collectively plan for the future um to address the Electrical uh needs that clean water services will have as we we serve this growing region but even looking at um reliability and uh resiliency measures such as standby generation and battery storage and also these Community Based Solutions so that was really exciting to do some more understanding of Emergency Management coordination in the event of a Cascadia event and and to make sure that we're sharing some of these best practices for business continuity across our organizations and they're going to share with us so we can do our planning on potential pricing increases and um so we can plan what our operating expense will be but it it was a a great meeting thank you chair for making that um suggestion and um we really enjoyed our time with dep General Electric and we're very thankful for Maria pop and her too well it's been interesting uh going on walks during the Spring season uh and uh Tanya and I had a meeting with uh CEO Maria Pope PGE CEO Maria Pope um and members of her team subsequent to the ice storm in January and uh they really um their Urban Tree Expert and and Miss Pope helped me internalize how in many older neighborhoods the electrical power poles are in the backyards and you know if you've got two streets and houses sharing that backyard fence line and spring is a great time for seeing how all the different bushes you know road to denden bushes can get huge right as well as the trees uh Vine Maples and otherwise and to see how the lines go through multiple lines and the there were different trees lost as well I know it was very predominant in commissioner tesa's District um it's it's pretty amazing and those neighborhoods need to think about if they need to make some changes uh because there really continued susceptibility in future snow and ice storms tell you who something I hadn't really thought about so it's been an interesting season for walking around PGE does have a program called right tree right right place and if you Google that you can find it on their website to try and help each of us uh figure out the array of landscape materials that our local nurseries offer and try to imagine what size these plants will be in 30 plus years in order to figure out where we should plant up yeah interesting Al righty anything else for the good of order okay well that takes us to the end of board and Leadership communication so we'll move on to an executive session do we have a motion to adjourn to Executive session pursuant to 660 sub2 subi for the purposes of performance evaluation so move second we have a motion and a second all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I I did there you looking any opposed the motion carries unanimously five to zero okay",

with that i will shift this over to introductions and roundtable discussion the way i was hoping we could do this is advisory committee members just introduce themselves and their organization first keep that short and simple and then after we get through the advisory i have a couple of uh sort of prompting questions that i'll put up on the screen and then we can get into a bit of a round table discussion so i was thinking we'd just do a quick 10 minute introductions first if that works for everyone i suppose there's probably no better way to do it than just the way they're listed here on the screen so i see um representative marsh here i do not see senator taylor so we can start with representative marsh sure this is pam marsh i am um house representative for district five which is

everyone um and thanks for joining us i will move on to the round table discussion next but just a quick note before we do that we have about 30 folks um who are attendees not members of the advisory committee uh if you're uh able to put your name and organization in the for all of us to be able to see that would be great and then again we will have time at the end of the agenda today for public comment where we can have audio and video on for you so i just wanted to get the conversation going today um with a couple of prompting questions here um so you know again kind of the objective statement that we reviewed earlier is really about us trying to identify the range of perspectives that are out there so we recognize that um we put a lot of questions on the table got a lot of feedback they may or may not have captured the the range and universe of of issues and questions that folks have so we thought we'd just have a round table discussion and really just give an open forum for folks to put things on the um so sort of some guiding questions you know if you have a is there a primary issue if you had to identify one that you really want to be sure that we for the legislature in our report and two uh almost maybe more importantly uh what's missing you know again we asked a lot of questions but we didn't ask everything um so i'll i'll throw those two questions out and um i'm happy to uh just cold call people but i i know the folks here have a lot of thoughts and perspectives and opinions on this so i'm happy to just uh open up the floor and uh any any thoughts adam and sarah you may have noticed that uh portland general and pacificorp submitted comments together we coordinated uh submitted upon us labeled as joint utilities one of the themes you'll see in our comments um maybe ad nauseam is whether or not we see a net benefit is largely going to depend on the specific market design that's related to that regional transmission organization there is not necessarily one market design coming from the federal energy regulatory commission delivering rto design there's quite a bit of variation and i think some of the work we'll be doing in this committee is to explore",

        "text": " setback established by the governing body is not an applicable substantive criteria but what is the description of an applicable substantive criteria the administrative rule says its criteria from the affected local government's acknowledged comprehensive plan that's the county and land use ordinances that are required by the Statewide planning goals and that are on the effect in effect on the date the applicant submits the application State statutes are the same the two-mile setback meets that description the two-mile setback was in effect when the application was filed and it is required by at least goal two whose purpose is to establish a land use planning process and policy framework for the basis of all decisions affecting land use goal to expressly requires counties to hold public hearings of evaluate information from the public in public hearings and make ultimate policy choices based upon their citizens social economic energy and environmental needs and then to reflect those local determinations in plans that and I quote shall be the basis for specific implementation measures I.E Criterion 3. Criterion three the two mile setback does exactly what goal 2 requires the county to do it cannot be said otherwise based upon written and oral testimony the governing body established the two-mile setback from rural residences and turbines there is no serious claim really that Criterion 3 doesn't do exactly what goal 2 requires that means the County's adoption of the two-mile setback is required by goal two goal 2 further requires that state actions related to land use shall be consistent with the land use rules of cities and counties so even if even if fsec were to apply the goals directly the result would be the same fsec has to comply with Goal two there's no sort of magic thing that says we'll go you can ignore gold too and you have to you know apply everything else no all of the goals apply goal 2 required the county to adopt exactly that and if you establish a precedent that says well unless Counties have an absolute duplicate of the local standard that is adopted that a particular commercial wind developer doesn't want to comply with or any energy developer doesn't want to comply with you're basically saying there's no local land use standards that are ever going to apply because the whole explain to the system is to set broad policy objectives and we've K we've cited a bunch of Supreme Court cases to talk about this set broad policy objectives that local government are required to synthesize and apply by adopting after public hearings hearing from the public based on substantial evidence in the record adopt local rules that do what the county feels is best as a matter of land use for the county and that is what gold 2 fundamentally requires and you don't want to set a precedent that says goal two is irrelevant it doesn't really require anything because that's not what it's ever been held to say that isn't what it says it says County go out and do what you did here adopt local rules including rules on energy and the county did exactly what it was required to do it's acknowledged as being in compliance with the goals which isn't the end of it they are required to do what they did and now Odo is saying in the plcp pcco says well you can ignore that because there's no specific goal that says you have to have a two-mile setback from wind turbines well of course there isn't of course there isn't thank you that's true for the Department of energy the LG correctly held that the County's setback ordinance Criterion 3 is not an applicable substantive Criterion uh you have before you a handout that I provided a cover page looks like this the second page is the rule you've heard this definition uh I've highlighted that it's 345 2230 sub 3 want to make sure you're there counselor Howe this is the first page go to the second page look at our rule this is the key to the whole case what's an applicable substantive Criterion but that's what you need to apply the county needs to recommend applicable substantive Criterion if it meets the definition then you apply it in the definition it says that the applicable substantive criteria they recommend have to be required by Statewide planning goals this setback is not required by any goal if it was required by a goal every County would have such a setback to the Department's knowledge Umatilla County is the only County in Oregon that has a setback such as the one that they're suggesting you must apply the department sees that setback as a not in my backyard type ordinance a NIMBY ordinance Umatilla County doesn't like it when they first adopted it one of the reasons why they said their adopting it was to protect property protecting property values while it might be a noble goal is not a goal that is required by the Statewide land use planning goals with regard to the goal 2 argument it requires cities and counties to adopt comprehensive plans and to enact land use regulations to implement those plans nothing in goal 2 requires a local government to enact regulations establishing setbacks for wind turbines or to protect citizens property values the County's argument that gold 2 requires you to to apply the setback directly conflicts with statutes governing the fsec process and here I'm going to refer to you the same handout 469-504 the first page if you look at subsection 6 which is actually sorry the second page and I've highlighted the relevant subsection six I'm actually sorry I didn't highlight it but it's in subsection six subsection six says the council is not subject to ORS 197.180 what is 197.180 says that statute requires that state agencies ensure that their actions are consistent with local comprehensive plans and regulations the legislature says fsec you don't have to make sure what you do is consistent with local comprehensive plans it says the opposite if you look at statute one root one provision down it says I want to make sure I'm there each affected local government in this case the county shall amend its comp plan and land use regulations as necessary to reflect the decision of the council pertaining to a site certificate or amended site certificate so write in statute so what does that mean it means if you decide counties recommended and county has this ordinance that has a setback but if you decide the setback doesn't apply they need to amend their ordinance so what their ordinance ought to say is we have this two-mile setback but if you go before fsec it doesn't apply in the fsec process right in the statute they need to amend to make consistent with your decisions not vice so contrary to the County's argument it is the county that must make amend its comp plan and regulations to be consistent with f sex decision so this we're talking here just about the first of the in this group in the department respectfully suggests that Council reject that exception and agree with the proposed contested case order holding that the county setback is not an applicable substantive Criterion because it is not required by the Statewide goals I will also note that this was considered by you uh when reviewing the draft proposed order and your former colleague chair Jenkins made that same statement on the record that he agreed with staff that the setback was not required by the Statewide goals I need to go quickly on the next in this grouping this is the exception that says Odo and fsec do not have jurisdiction to review or reverse the special advisory group's identification of Criterion 3 our response is yes you have jurisdiction to determine if a recommended Criterion is recommended by the Statewide goals proposed contested case order correctly held that to the extent the local government recommends criteria not required by the goals Council has no obligation to apply that criteria that is what the alj ruled there has been an argument and Ms Kellington brought this up that under ors-469.5048 again it's in this handout that that divests the Council of the authority to to conduct this review that only the Supreme Court has that ability that is not correct that statute does not prohibit you from reviewing it it establishes that judicial review goes to the Supreme Court normally land use decisions go to Luba the land use board of appeals and then the court of appeals all this is saying consistent with appeals of your final decision consistent with appeals of rules that you draft it doesn't go those appeals don't go to Luba they don't go to the court of appeals they go directly to the Supreme Court that's all it's not saying that you don't have the right to do it it's saying that when a court review",

        "text": " bond because the whole point is it just making sure that we have that you know in hand and we're not in an exposed situation where the state of Oregon is obligated to decommission the facility without any funding part of that agreement or we're not a signatory to the agreement but the agreement references specifically the site certificate conditions in the state certificate so if the bond Temple language you know sort of placeholder uh places for the referencing to we are the you know basically will be the recipient of the the money thank you this is why on a yearly basis we bring the template language for the bond for the letter of credit and then um we evaluate the financial institutions commit for their credit it was really helpful and I don't think I articulated it when we last talked um this issue um the other concern I I have is on our approval uh of an applicant for a site certificate and what the security um as part of the evidence we received Comfort letters um that should give us some comfort that there's Financial Security I have some concern that uh an insurance would be concerned with this liability um they're they're canceling the bond for a reason and they're giving notice of cancellation for a reason I think they're they wouldn't want to you know pay the have this on called on and so just as part of our process um to make sure that the The Entity giving us the Comfort letter is aware of this provision and is saying yeah we're comfortable saying that somebody will issue a bond it's just to me it's that front-end piece of approval that is also a bit of a concern to me so thank you thank you and so before concluding this one I just want to express my continued appreciation for councilmember Condon to raise these questions particularly on the financial Assurance so we've never had to call on a bond or letter of credit we've never gone through you know kind of full decommissioning process so it is a little bit of a question mark how this is all going to work um when it works so I do appreciate the continued questions we want to make sure that this is done right and that again the state of Oregon is not put in position um where somebody walks away from a facility and we don't have the financial means available to pay for restoring it okay last on my list is future Council um the April 19th and 20th is the next council meeting dates that were held we will not be having a council meeting so I just wanted to make sure everybody was aware of that so the states are released the maybe eating dates are the 18th and 19th we do anticipating having meeting in May the driver will probably be the draft proposed order hearings for the Boardman Hemingway amendment number one so we're planning for two hearings one would be big in Baker City and the other in Pendleton we are still working through how that would all work um and you know whether that would be in part of those 18th and 19 dates or not and so um what my plan is to look into that a little more clearly I have a better understanding and then early next week uh providing email to council either soliciting availability for different dates or whatever sort of options are that have come up we've come up with related to those DPO here in dates just sounds just uh you know so I will be out of commission yes um through May 21st just as an you know then thank you for that information all right and that concludes my secretary report Madam chair unless there are any questions from counselors any questions related report word I see a head on from the screen if you have any questions feel free to speak speak up no questions from Kent thank you thank you oh councilmember Devlin sorry because I didn't see you I forgot do you have any Madam chair can you hear me yes sir uh no questions thank you all right well that concludes that agenda thank you very much secretary Burnett our next item on the agenda is the Westin solar project this is the final order on application for site certificate with potential for material change hearing uh we have college party weather senior siding analyst ready to present to council good morning Kelly good morning for the record telling Charlie weather senior citing analyst guarding the department of energy um thank you council members for being on the line and in the room um true to how these things work out I was going to um run this portion of the presentation so I can toggle in between the PowerPoint and the post order as need be and then my computer decided that it needed to update um so um so now I don't have any of my documents or and I'm not logged into the meeting so it'll take me like two minutes do you want me to give me two minutes to to be able to do that yes get yourselves okay because I think that is just the best way to go about these things we're going to take a pause every while telling it or just have it together because we've all been in those shoes can you mute your phone to see if that's the one that we're getting the feedback no okay no you've muted me yes that is usually automatically in the let's partying element name dot Oregon I mean energy.org so last name dot energy it's not um it's not automatically detecting it's great okay Wally I'm in it's good all right thank you so much everybody for being so patient um okay um as uh chair Doyle noted we are here for council's um review of the proposed order and potential final decision on the application for site certificate for the Westin solar project um here in the room uh our uh staff and I have Rob perula um the representative governor of solar and I also have David Tomlinson um from your solar as well so thank you gentlemen for being present for your objective item the presentation overview today um we have about an hour slated for this agenda item but I think that it's going to go pretty quickly because um it's a pretty narrow set of topics that I'm going to go over with Council today so I'm going to do an overview of the applicant the facility and the location of the facility I'm going to touch on the procedural history of how we uh how we got here today um and then we're going to go over the proposed order and but it's going we're going to really focus on the the DPO um from Council and the applicant and kind of the evolution of where we um got with those red lines that appeared in the proposed order so I'm going to to focus on those um and then based on council's deliberation and discussion um if their Council changes any makes any material changes which we consider those changes to conditions in the site certificate and not necessarily um dating a binding of facts that would have that wouldn't be considered a material change if Council makes any material changes to conditions as they are in the proposed order then there will be an opportunity what we call this material change um to where the applicant would have an opportunity to comment on those changes so here is the the procedural history now the um a western solar project is uh just a 50 megawatt solar facility so it um Falls uh within the threshold Which is less than 99 megawatts um of generating capacity um to be processed underneath the expedited review rules uh which functionally are the same as an app regular applications rules except there's no um notice of intent phase so the first um is the actually get a preliminary application rather than a notice of um so we we have originally when they requested the expedited review and then we got the preliminary application in November of 2021 um the other uh you know council is required under statute Council has some interesting timelines in there um and Council has six months um to reach it's final decision after an application for site certificate has been submitted so and we consider that the complete application not the preliminary so the preliminary was submitted I'm sorry it was the preliminary yeah it was in 2021 but the application was September 28 2022. and so for six months is March 28th 2022 2020 33 right yes Rick yes um so this is timely um but we are still within our time so this is the portion of the statute that is guiding the scope of council's um now there is this are you able to hear us I can't speak you've muted me you've muted me what's going on as he's logged in twice I think he's logged in and like where you can see them and I think he also has a spell that he was probably trying to use for audio and that's where we were getting feedback is that is that these use it as a phone for audio and he has that might unmute it that's if you get that portal so he's shaking his head right now I mean it's yes you are yes you are can we call them so so council member talk to can you give me a thumbs up if you can hear us okay can you speak right now we can hear you we can hear you when you hear me we can hear you yes my phone's not on the webinar is working I think that's we can hear you I think we can hear you through the computer it says it's un you muted me yeah I don't know where it's coming from but we can hear you right now so I mean you guys have a background it's echoing so are you are you logged in on your phone and your computer my phone's off council member Truitt are you hearing any echoing no everything sounds good on my end so I it sounds like you guys are talking from a long tunnel and he doesn't have spelling there well does it log off and log back on you can before you do that I'll just say your I show you it's logged in twice and the second login I just made a panelist as well so you would have control over mute and unmute over that that that um let's see yes I do yes I did and then uh start video just came back okay how's it now are you able to hear us without an echo okay great all right everybody wins all right I'm proceeding but if there's any issues just uh just let us know and I'll stop and we can um so the scope of council's review um when it um the council May amend or reject the proposed order um so Council has has three options right Council can uh approve the proposed order as is a staff recommended",

        "text": " is one that the Oregon Trial Association has involvement with okay that's correct chair thank you are they great um good job so besides the interim next the work groups that will um be playing supportive roles to AOC or more actively engaging in um there's the work to be done with you as we said ourselves up for 2025 so um building this bridge uh through Clean Services uh wanted to provide you with a a timeline of the kind of the next quarter um so in April we're gonna work with um the the CEO team set you up for a successful initial conversation with the legisl with the legislature on the public safety and Justice needs within Washington County um and then in May we'll start working with your board to set ourselves up for um an approach to the legislative agenda for 2025 really focusing on what are our big needs what are the things that we need to be paying most attention to what are the resources that we need to continue the work that we're doing um and we will we are tentatively scheduled to meet with your board during the work session in May 7th to start that process in June we know that's when a lot of the interim work groups and task forces tend to meet do their work um something about the summer um so we'll be working through those that'll help us flag other issues that might be coming forward in the 202 2025 session um we also know that's really when the state budget process really picks up for the Departments and that's another place where we can um they their process is starting now honestly where they're assessing their needs and making a requests of the governor's office and the Govern governor's office goes through their process and then it becomes there so that's where our participation as a county saying hey dlcd you were required to seek funding for County technical assistance related to um House Bill 4063 let's see that in your um policy option packages or your base budget um those sorts of conversations will take place across the state um budget process in addition we'll be continuing the conversations internally um looking into your board the leadership and Department of the county in setting our own prioritizations and recognizing what needs and um needs we expect to have both on a policy and in a budgetary need from the state starting in June and then continuing all of that work through July um to your comment chair about being aware of uh pression filing deadlines and Concepts being due on September 27th or at least earmarked for not earmarked but marked for consideration we are going to work this session to um ramp up the agenda creating creation process a little bit faster so that we can have those policy Concepts if we need them ready earlier and at least have initially had the buyin of the board if we don't have a finalized agenda through September at least be a lot closer that we aren't getting ahead of you and you're setting our guide you're guiding us with what we need to be putting bills in for um as we also look at the budget needs that we have so that is our goal why we are starting this process in May and we will be back with you um then in meantime any questions I just love that ow questioning owl um we have really appreciated the direct engagement that the board has put forward this year it's been proven vital to our successes and we will continue to work um that through the interim with you figure out the places where um we need to start those conversations the courthouse being the greatest um example of that so that we're prepared um and have already shown our delegation what they need to to be supporting us and and um have you as their regular contacts through the rest of the year so that way when we call on you in 2025 to provide that testimony and information to the legislature you have the relationships developed um any questions forther for the any questions or comments just context big is state budget I can Google we will get back to you with that because I don't want to misspeak bigger than ours seem always interesting give you a few million and act like that's a big deal I think there's probably multi multi hundreds of billions of dollars they're not so I just wonder what getting in terms of we will um get back to the board with information about that and we might do a little bit more of a detailed analysis when we come back for that May 7th um to kind of look at where there's opportunities to seek those larger Investments out of the state one of the things that I haven't seen in a long time and it maybe because I haven't looked hard enough for it it would be wonderful to get just a high level pie chart of where what are the major buckets where the state budget goes yeah track that down yes list for where that money goes well that's that's a million doll question there right because with 90 different members of the legislature get at least 90 different answers I'd like to they have some common focus of what's really important money spent is the pr pass that work a little so um to wrap it up I have one question if you go back one um so the AOC ledge retreat in late June is being rescheduled I assume to another date in June but I don't know um given how the scheduling of it got pass them for so long uh despite there being a meaning conflict uh and the reason that I raised that is relative to the September pre-file date and making sure that the Commissioners that participate in AOC steering committees and the ledge committee have that same level of awareness on the timeline helpful okay we'll wrap that into these uh future timelines and make sure that we're all prepared to support you through that legislative Retreat process well I think the support of our government relations team for the board unequivocal thank we we know it we see it we're engaged with you you engag with us thank you thank you all uh we're just a little bit ahead of schedule isn't that a wonderful thing yes uh so board and Leadership communication and I've already gone so who else would like to go would always I I will do it I will um I'll be quick too um so I think I sent you the information in an email the the round table that I participated uh the I ja Round Table focused on opportunity for modernization modernizing public transit um um it was a really good information the other um thing that I learned that I wanted to just for board awareness uh to raise it is uh triet is converting its entire 800 diesel bus fleet to electric buses by 2035 as you all know Tred is an Oregon single largest user of diesel in the state and the promise is they will not buy any more diesel buses um period they are going to have a combination of a battery electric buses and hydrogen electric buses uh the the difference between the two battery buses only operate about 125 miles of charge and hydrogen um electric buses operate about miles so that was a really good information that others benefited uh in the round table um and let me know that as well electronically uh the other thing for board awareness as your rep on wccc uh that was yesterday wccc meeting happening yesterday the big topic was um the group was voting on was the mstp 3F allocations um to recom yeah to recommend to us um to the board uh and the proposal of the $250 million and the committee voted unanimously to recommend tax recommendation to us so and that is coming to us November 16 April 16th oh hey I have company April 16th there we go how did I make that large leave I have no idea we were talking election oh okay thank you thank you I appreciate that election that's where I got the November but April 16 the topic is coming to our through summer yet please yeah spring is just at our doorstep so yeah and then the other thing that's happening as your board rep this week is I a jpack meeting is happening Thursday not tomorrow I almost said tomorrow uh not tomorrow Thursday and there's not a um any big topics on the agenda that we need to have a board discussion so that I can vote for so it's just an informational only uh so rest assured I won't be taking any votes on have of our board so let's see it's the middle of March at what point during the year will jpack and the Metro Council need to close on RTP is it done it's done last Mary Nolan was the one desending vote oh I forgot last so it's just the ugr that's the big deal this year yeah great thanks yeah yeah that I think the next biggest jump from April to November so I I thought it was trick I thought it was a date related and I like I don't but um I think the other big discussion will be the rougher oh yeah yeah but that's to continued and that concludes my update who's next you to go Jerry's next okay um so obviously last week there was a couple of days that I was on vacation then I came back and Wednesday and Thursday went to San Francisco for the Genentech local government Affairs spring Forum that was basically where we go down and uh we visit their South San Francisco uh campus it's about 200 Acres buildings uh I think they have around 10 to 12,000 employees in there uh they are absolutely maxed out and have been for a number of years so they're looking at kind of a re uh construction I think redesign of that facility but that'll come about they are um they are the biomed company in the world they're owned by ro um out of Switzerland um and they are doing I mean they've just a number of really great things that I appreciate certainly all the work that they do and um and we are the benefactors partially up here by the Hillsboro location of course they've added two new buildings in the last few years and they have space to add one more if they need it and and if they can guess work that direction so stay tuned with that it's always good to go down and have that there from an environmental and sustainability company uh they have 72 buses and they are EX experiencing um unforeseen issues with those 72 buses so I hope tret is long term and their conversion anticipation because um because there are some complications with that obviously 125 miles isn't a very uh isn't a lot of miles when you're putting on a public bus uh and the hydrogen part twoo was interesting that",

        "text": " have the jobs associated with it was mentioned you know oregon was a loss for the timber industry there was a lot of jobs lost with that and this could be an opportunity to help regain some of that footing that we lost there and then as you know the costs go down for solar uh this is sort of an indirect cost as a cost go down for solar this may be an opportunity to help offset other um fossil fuel generation needs and um i'll ask grant to um correct me if i'm wrong because we didn't directly discuss this but i think he was referring to things such as um maybe you have backup power that's through um fossil fuel generator and maybe solar and storage would be an opportunity to help offset that or potentially fuel your vehicle if you have an electric vehicle or something like that and i think as far as direct benefits that is the and so i'll ask dan grant and theodora is there anything i've missed that you want to flag for the i think you got it i think you got it as well thank you all right group two it's me stephanie our my group and we didn't get to the point of asking somebody else so there's not so pardon more me um we went through and categorized and i'll try to not name ones that aren't that are already i don't think this is that energy dollars can go to local communities and they can pay off the debt pay for the or even over time provide revenue to fill service gaps the aberdeen project came up specifically that you don't need to write that down necessarily and then could support union jobs and i have in my notes here a lot of questions for stephanie to grapple with um related to this one which she works on what comes after this under indirect economic impacts um i slid energy sovereignty there although it's one that could go in all different but in a community owned type of scenario people can choose from for themselves how they get power and the various different pieces that can go with that i'm not really sure about this one either but essentially um achieving economies of scale so as we have more of different types of small energy projects they can get and then reduce land-use conflicts but that comes with also less efficient use of the space speaker to ache or want to watch someone climate impacts or no health impacts talked about specifically um commercial food waste being converted to biogas and how that can reduce greenhouse gases by reducing the transportation of food waste to biogas and then also um this is also related to resilience but the like literal um ability to have can have health impacts during an emergency so if people have access to water and food or whatever because there's a facility that's open that has power that can provide them with options that can have public health benefits however you want to say that and then medical care can be provided if there's power that wouldn't otherwise be able to be provided without it and then finally under health impacts reduced reliance on diesel generators and then um i think that you already got one now i'm just seeing mostly mine but there are groups but there's also for example bio waste energy projects that can have water quality impacts that's under health though i just put that in the wrong place i apologize and then um oh i think i just like ready the health ones and said they were climate ones basically oops um under climate just broadly increasing renewables reduces greenhouse gases although that is not necessarily unique and then resilience impacts we already talked about one of them i'm not sure this one exactly came up we kind of know in oregon specifically our liquid fuels could get really tied up we have a really i think most of you probably know that we have a critical energy infrastructure hub in portland that has the vast majority of liquid fuels in the state it's in a liquefaction zone so if there's a cascadia quake we know that it's basically gonna not not be not be servicing our needs for quite some time so um so kind of a backup to that dynamic specifically came up and then i'll ask my group if there's anything that i left off that sounds good all right i believe we were group three um so i'm going to be talking and typing we're going to see how this goes so a lot of the stuff you guys have talked about in other groups um like phasing out the diesel generators for sure was already mentioned um so i'll focus more on the jobs the education um infrastructure increases sorry keep on looking down at my notes the training in human capital if we become more skilled we could potentially export those skills to other states as they're developing their programs after us and i'll type ours after sorry i'm not good at this um diversification of local communities in terms of like economic diversification spin-off benefits from some of these projects um i can see a lot of these with um the commercial food waste but this one was more looking at the heat generated from some of these projects potentially going to heat greenhouses during winter um dry kiln for lumber and rural hospitals being able to be set up as emergency first responders um during a crisis if they have these uh benefits built in so i'll type those after because i have them written so if group four wants to go all right i tried to recruit an actual work group member we were too busy coming up with lots of good content so i took the notes and i'll i'll share it we have quite a bit of overlap but somewhere i think there's a a little twist on what's already been said on the resilience piece aggie who was in our group mentioned um in the case of a lot of tribal what we see with a lot of the underserved communities and tribal communities is that they are often the last ones to be brought back online in a power outage and so the resilience value is really magnified for some communities more than when we look at the both when the power you know when is the power going to be brought back on and we didn't talk specifically about this but the impact on the residents of not having power you know a refrigerator full of food it has a lot more meaning to some people than it does to others in terms of the value of that um we had a lot of really interesting benefits associated with the ability of local projects to develop specific sites and specific resources that are passed over by large developers and so it's these sort of niche sites or sites with other barriers that may not warrant development by some of the larger developers and um the the pontu wind project was one example where the site was adjacent to an airspace that had some red strings attached to it and it took a local you know it took armand a local guy to to get over those barriers but there were others one was smaller projects locally developed projects are more likely to capture some of these odd waste streams like landfill gas or or bio streams like like jessica mentioned also in kind of the category of citing locally developed small projects have reduced nimbyism and so there's a greater acceptance of and let's see i think that kind of captures the sighting piece on the economics piece i think one that we brought up that we hadn't heard yet is the local tax base being boosted and also just from a cost standpoint there is some evidence that in in some cases smaller projects can actually have lower soft costs if they don't have a huge organization with a lot of internal bureaucracy they can actually have pretty low costs on some of these smaller projects when you get a good good team together to put them you know to build and operate the projects we also had eric with with pack in our team and among a lot of these other things he mentioned that in some cases these local smaller projects can have positive benefits to the distribution system by reducing line losses and deferring investments in grid infrastructure and i would um maggie also mentioned that these smaller projects are sometimes easier they kind of mitigate the risks and costs associated with transmission studies and i've got all these written down so if you don't grab them i i can share them after the fact and i welcome any of our committee members to fill in any holes that i've left did you mention the health benefits rob i didn't think i heard that but maybe i i did not health and carbon were both brought up as additional benefits thank you yeah in terms of not having toxic pollution from most renewables both in our community and folks who have whole generation and oil refineries in their communities i don't know if you really caught it small projects can also take advantage of existing yeah and as armin mentioned if you have an interconnection agreement for 10 megawatts and your capacity factor is 36 there's a lot of headroom potentially in that 10 megawatts to export a lot more of the time if you add batteries or solar or kind of diversify the resources within within a given interconnection to increase the the capacity factor for the site all right group five hey this is ruchi um i didn't ask anyone to volunteer so i guess i'll do it my group was group five and we had hannah from bonneville mark from lane county ryan from central electric co-op and tom from so i'll just go over a few things but you four please jump in if i missed anything or we got kind of cut off at the end because our we didn't notice the um the 60 minute or 60 second timer so i may have missed a part of the end there um there's sort of like an overarching piece where in the northwest the hydropower system has such great economic benefit that payback is a lot longer for smaller projects without grants or subsidies so it's kind of an overarching comment that was a thread throughout but there is a local benefit from the installers that may work on smaller scale projects in terms of jobs in the local community and one of the specific pieces there was those types of dogs jobs are likely to be very local in nature and stay in the there was also a discussion about how in ashland there's been a lot of work to incentivize solar on rooftops and that's actually kept ashland from reaching the tier 2 bonneville rate um i think the the quote there was that it's a 20 average megawatts but there's 4.5 megawatts of rooftop solar and so even though currently tier two power is cheaper than tier one a few years ago that wasn't the case and the dynamics",

        "text": " it paid for however the property sizes in Detroit for the business district as well as other areas are extremely small as most of you know that limits any kind of development the only thing that's going to expand that is a permanent system and as you may have heard me say before my biggest fear is that a temporary solution is the most permanent in the world we're not funded we have $5 million from the 50 million that was uh allocated for project a which is m city and Gates and we're we're grateful for that it's going to do a lot in the short term but my plea to you this morning besides thanking you for all that you have done uh not just you but your staff has been remarkable throughout our process is that you provide us with some guidance and help in terms of securing funding of the $62 million we need to make Detroit a viable City in the future our country is a wash right now in resources related to coid and Recovery funds that are aren't being used and that are regularly being repurposed for other uses I just think that there's an opportunity here and I started yesterday calling Representatives personally but I don't have a lot of clout with those folks but if you all can help us guide us to work with our state and federal representatives to try and find solutions to Source the $62 million you know I don't know what that'll look five years from now but if you use current rates today of of inflation it's probably going to be $80 million so it just seems to me that 62 is a better number to deal with if we can find a source now and um and be ready to execute on the plan that we'll have because of the $5 million we've had allocated for our our temporary services um property options in the in the idena area and so on so um I think we have a marvelous team everybody's dedicated passionate um we'll do whatever it takes our head down our Fanny up and we're digging all the time uh we just need your assistance again and probably again and again until this thing reaches its potential some years into the future and thank you so much I'd be happy to answer any questions thank you Denny questions well uh just maybe some comments um Denny and I want to thank you and Michelle for your service Council and and I'll just get this out of the way because we're going to um we're going to move on this I want to declare a potential conflict of interest on this because I am on the Planning Commission in Detroit um and uh I am a resident of Detroit which that population is no big deal but the Planning Commission will probably be dealing with some of this so just get that out of the way but uh I I want you to know that it is really important to me as a resident of Detroit the service that you both provide and I know you're both residents up there as well um the the work that we are concurrently doing and I think you know this about the sewer system is the design is happening as we are designing U mil City the same time we're getting we're getting there you you're right and the funding's not there um and I want to say this that it's never stopped we have never stopped right uh um uh advocating for that funding uh in fact I don't know I probably heard it you know every day from Jan right hey what what are we going to do to get that funding in in Detroit and um it's going to be an uphill battle I mean it is and nothing like that comes easy and you're right we had this fire recovery we had arpa we had all that money that 50 million that flowed and I think we set aside 10 million for Detroit we we set aside five for the design and five for the the grant program uh that's happening up there um I want to compliment our public works department and Brian uh Nicholas and uh Kim or not Kim but um who's the Chris but Kim Alim yeah so so the that they're doing and you're right it is a team and um one of the things I've always said since I became a county commissioner uh Maran county has the most Incorporated cities of any county in the state out of 36 counties we have 20 Incorporated cities and if you take Salem Kaiser Woodburn maybe even the suburb of Sublimity ston nice out of out of out of the the mix you think about the other 15 or you know 14 cities and how small they are you know populations of 400 people and we know that we have to help and that that's what our economic development department has done so well over the years and we are not going to let this this tiger we're not going to let this tiger go as long as I'm here we'll keep doing it and I always say this will I be alive when the first toilet flesh is in Detroit I don't know it takes a long time to any as you well know to get any of these infrastructure projects done uh commissioner bethl uh um bless her she she put forth this resolution uh that we're taking I took it down to no um to extend the the deadline for arpa dollars you know right now it has to be spent by 2026 is that right Jan and you know when you're doing a sewer or Water Project you can't get all that money spent and can't get it done so I mean we're working as we as we talk here right now we have been continuing to do that and um I know our federal deleg Elation we have good relationships with both our Senators and our Congress people and they're going to do everything they can to help too they understand the need up there in idana and Detroit both those cities need this uh system and we need to protect the water supply for the people that you know rely on that as we all know from what five six years ago when we had that algae outbreak so I just want to say thank you to both of you for your service and to this team that that I'm blessed to work with every day and and and the department heads and all the staff that we get to work with we we hear you we know and um we'll continue to do everything we can um to to try to grab those dollars and and it's going to take I tell people this all the time my water bill what did it go up to and I haven't seen it $82 $82 just for water in Detroit I remember I increased my check to 80 so I better get back there and do my automatic check to to to more so $82 just for water no sewer no storm water and I don't know here in Salem I know I pay a water bill uh on a house that I that I rent and it is um a lot less than that so it's going to be a heavy lift for Detroit to be able to pay for a sewer system and a water bill um you know because you even if we got it even if we got all the money to install the infrastructure you're still going to have to have a fund to replace things and to repair and to pay for the service so you know you're talking it's going to be $150 a month or so just for sewer and water probably up there um which you know a lot of people um are going to have a hard time with but I'm excited I love that you're here uh I love that you're serving and that Michelle's serving um on the city council I think I've been a part of Detroit for a long time and I've never seen it function the way it's functioned now with with the leadership up there so thank you and I know you got another big issue that I don't want to talk about oh yeah I do actually uh first I uh want to just say I'm a little um that there would be any feeling or belief that we're not fully invol involved and invested in the Detroit sewer project uh literally since the first day I was sworn into office it's been a conversation weekly and I I would uh say that well I don't go up there to the canyon and come to City Council meetings and do all that stuff regularly um the north Sanam Sewer Authority is the local Authority along with the city council that's in my mind based on the feedback I've received from the citizens kind of leading this right that that's the legal jurisdictions and we at least I believe this board has embraced um every ask that's ever been sent our way uh and so I would say I'll still be here I'll continue to Advocate uh but maybe we need to figure out a way to align Partnerships um you know I meet with uh Senator we's office at least quarterly to talk about housing Wild recovery is something I've worked on since I first day and the sewer project was something that obviously was involved way before me I mean a decade before I was even considering being a commissioner and it just takes so long and I had heard last week that you were coming from a local person uh that kind of gave me a different perspective as to what you might be asking for um so we're here I'm here colum and Kevin we're for sure 100% involved in this and if there's something that you think we're not getting if it's from the staff or from the NSSA or whatever I know you have my cell phone number because we had a great meeting upstairs in my office about housing and I would hope that you would use it so yes $62 million is a lot now and it'll be a lot in five or 10 years um but maybe I feel like maybe we've missed the opportunity of communication to help create the timeline to get to where we even are with the m city Gates expansion right I mean Mary County doesn't have 50 or $60 million to give if we did we would have done it um and I think that we could do a better job of um just communicating what we are doing and what we need your help on because I I don't want to just be the Board of Commissioners tamping a local ask I do think it's really helpful for Senator weiden and Merkley they're going to be here uh my understanding sometime in the next 30 days we should invite you you should come down they kind of do a co- Town Hall type effort commissioner Cameron usually moderates it um and let's make sure they see you and hear from you uh because I do believe that that's where we're",

        "text": " for Strategic investment program proposals that may come in through private companies he's gonna break out in song in a minute I'm sorry sorry sorry sorry take it away Matt craigy our economic development manager thank you chair Harrington good evening uh again Commissioners I was just looking at the agenda and and I hope that there's not I know that there's no confusion at the board level but for any public that is listening there is a CIP and an sip this evening and there's a capital Improvement plan and this is not that this is the Strategic investment program at different different thing entirely so uh I'm just going to run through a few slides here to talk about uh the update uh to the County's siip policy uh we've been working with your board uh for a number of months now to update the 2006 era County policy which uh guides uh County's negotiations with private companies around this very important economic incentive uh tool so this evening I again I'll just uh go through a few slides here to talk about the Sip uh we are hopeful that we will see a few companies come our way here in the next coming years the Sip is an economic incentive tool focused on traded sector companies um Advanced manufacturing companies um that are going to invest um Millions actually billions with a be uh potentially um in our region and the county plays a very important role in negotiating this economic incentive with those so in preparation for those discussions again we've been working with your board to update this policy here's a timeline of our conversations and uh maybe another apology here I think this uh packet agenda um this the packet that we put together is is massive when I looked at it I think it was 383 Pages um but we wanted to make sure that we had all of the documents the memos and the presentations and other appendices uh that have accompanied this these very important conversations with your board over the past few months so here is a a timeline that shows some of these conversations uh excuse me all of these conversations that we've had with your board since July of 2023 just a a brief recap bringing to where we are today we had a conversation with your board in July of 2023 where we went over a sip 101 and uh in September we brought some initial uh prop language changes to the policy and we had another discussion with your board uh just last month in March so here we are today the policy the question to your board being do you want to adopt the updated policy just real briefly for those in the audience uh and there are lots of details here but I will uh do my best to do a highlevel summary of how the siip tool Works uh the Sip Tool uh the Strategic investment program tool is a tax abatement incentive and so there is a minimum investment amount a a company would come our way and say we want to invest at least $150 million in Washington County uh the uh abatement period is for 15 years one thing that uh that folks should know about the Sip tool and something that I like everyone in Washington County to know is that these are some of our largest taxpayers and they do continue to pay tax even when they utilize the tool so there is a minimum uh uh taxable amount in urban areas that is a hundred million so there is a there is this persistent myth that well they don't pay taxes this is that's not true there are some of our largest uh taxpayers and contributors to the tax base here in Washington County in addition to that uh Baseline tax there is uh a uh community service fee which is a non-negotiable fee that the company pays um it is 25% of the abated tax amount with a annual maximum of $3 million um there are some changes uh recently due to uh Oregon uh legislative uh or the Oregon legislature um made a few changes around the minimums and so you'll recall uh before 2023 the um minimum amount was $2.5 Million for uh the community service fee it is now three M excuse me maximum it is now the the maximum uh annual amount of the community service fee is uh $3 million and that is adjusted uh with CPI so adjusted for inflation again that sip is a targeted investment tool it is not for every company that is looking to invest in Washington County it is for select companies uh that are traded sector companies typically Advanced manufacturing companies that are making Investments uh in this on the slide here you can see a number of uh data that demonstrate the uh quantitative benefits to Washington County which include property taxes special fees which includes that uh community service fee and also other negotiated fees that can be negotiated as part of the deal uh state income tax of course from uh the income of all of the employees and jobs this is uh sip is also about creating jobs this is limited data here that I have in this Slide the numbers are are larger uh if we were to roll them up to here to 2024 but you can see uh the massive um economic benefits and impacts that have resulted from past sips in Washington County this Slide reiterates the importance uh of uh the Sip tool and some of the results of an sip Tool uh the Sip Tool uh uh is important for regional competitiveness so as companies are looking to invest in locations globally it adds to the mix of benefits that they would see for investing in Oregon and specifically in Washington County uh sips uh typically uh create jobs that are high wage jobs um the I think I actually have the statistic here somewhere in my notes I think it is that the average job from an sip receiving company is 53% higher than um than the average uh let me make sure I'm getting this correct I don't want to throw out the wrong data point here okay sip jobs in Washington County are 53% higher than sips in other parts of the state so these are these are high wage uh jobs and also these uh the Sip companies also help with economic Mobility so helping folks uh achieve and acquire U better jobs that help them move up the career ladder and and get higher pay I think in my earlier presentation we talked about the Quick Start program uh where folks shifting careers uh can uh get into the semiconductor uh space so Washington County's sip policy um Washington County's sip policy uh is from 2006 there are four uh primary sections to the policy there's the program overview the program objectives evaluation guidelines and the review process the changes um that we are proposing are in two sections they are in the program overview and the program objectives uh Guided by your board's Direction uh staff have made several changes to the County's uh sip policy within the overview section um the changes are limited to updated language to reflect uh new project and exemption thresholds uh the program uh the proposed changes to the program objective sections also clarify and seek to align objectives with board feedback and a one Washington County approach and I have this slide that I maybe I'll do a third apology here gosh uh it is very hard to read I I do realize that but I wanted to make sure that we had a slide up here that demonstrates uh all of uh all of the proposed changes to the program objectiv and so this is where um the most substantive changes are proposed um these are again changes to reflect in modernize language and to reflect board feedback at a one Washington County approach so those changes are uh in the Highlight there and with that uh I will turn it back to you chair Harrington well thank you Mr craigy and this brings us to our third adopting our third uh fundamental building block for the evening this being a significant Economic Development tool modernizing it so Commissioners do you have any uh additional questions or comments and I do want to note that there is a one pager two-sided item in the pack packet but before we open it up for public comment which is something we wanted to do uh to make sure that uh community members uh had the opport opportunity before we uh adopt this to uh hear from them no I um Matt good job on this the um was certainly time for a little Refresh on this uh specifically as you pointed out the program of object objectives um I thought those were all good um and um so this is a great this is a great program I've been around uh for a long time with these things uh was engaged in the hundred billion dollar sip that we had in 2015 um so yeah I'm a big fan of this program so thanks very much for your work on this well without further Ado why don't we uh open up the public comment uh

        "text": "2023 meeting of the save on Planning Commission welcome everybody Shelby will you please call the road commissioner Augustine is absent commissioner ekis here can we do it again commissioner egus here commissioner fought here commissioner gopal is absent uh president Griggs here commissioner Heller here commissioner Levin here commissioner Slater and commissioner Viera brendell thank you um I would like to rearrange the agenda just slightly to remove item 6.2 from tonight's agenda and move it to the April 4th agenda unless there's any concern about that could we move it to the well I let me ask you first I intended to have some discussions yeah and actually intended to move at the time to postpone until the second meeting in April instead of the first meeting in April so I would be normally just super happy about that because that gives us a little bit more time but my understanding isn't I think Lisa is going to talk about it the April 18th sign code amendment is going to be moved out to May and I don't believe there's anything else scheduled for that night well that's kind of part of my reason for making for for I would have made the motion so I'm wondering where is the appropriate time on the agenda where I can discuss what would have been the motion to uh uh to adopt this amendment um would that be under a good reporters I would I would uh well I don't know where to just I'm trying to put this motion changing the idea of changing the bylaws into a certain context at least for me that context means having um my wish was to but my argument was that we should postpone it until after we had certain discussions about our lives removal and about um the opportunities we have to do that and uh I think whether or not we use the April 17th meeting or not and if we hit cancel because there's no agenda it kind of fits into the items of discussion that I was having so is there a reason why April 4th wouldn't work well I'd prefer to have more time for a I believe there are discussions we need to have before we take it out and I'm not sure that April 4th since it's next to me I'm not sure that that provides but possibly another alternative to give you enough time would be to schedule it in May one of the May hearings yeah I didn't do that because too much time I missed for miss one of those meetings well it's up to you you can have you can meet on April 2nd meeting April that could be the only object item I'm not saying we can't meet that's why I'm asking because I'm not sure where to have a discussion that I would have intended to have had there been a moment and I want you to have that discussion we're in this meeting to do that but I'd like to do that before we make a decision to put it on a particular team so you don't want to schedule it until we schedule that conversation so I'm going to prefer that yeah one way to approach it is to bring it up and make a motion to table it to a specific date which is actually what you're kind of suggesting right but I'm just coming so April 18th with that being okay that would be fine with me I think there's more time but that's my preference you know but there are other people may want to do it sooner and just don't feel like there's a there's a big rush to give it to the council and I think there's things that we should discuss about our advisory role and how we do that and how we organize that and the opportunities that having a meeting when there's nothing else on the agenda opportunity provides us to have discussions about some things that we'd like to advise and roll on and I don't have an issue with that at all I do know that staff flow has been pretty darn good on making room on an existing night that we are going to meet on a case to include other topics for consideration so I have never yet been in a situation where somebody has expressed an interest and let's hear more about you know the sign code or and them not having accommodations yes I understand that I guess it kind of gets into my concern here is that there's a couple of times when we've gone months without having a meeting right and there was a violation of the bylaw I'm not I'm not so concerned about that as I am the discussion we need to have about the advisory role we play and the opportunities to address issues that we find Opportunities we have to set priorities for what issues we want to play an advisory roll on yeah that's organized I my concern without having a discussion amongst us is that having me you know those those times when we don't have an agenda that comes from the name one of the land use process is a perfect opportunities to spend time on those issues for example today we've got the Renewables it's one of those so we have a process I know where individuals can say we want do this but if we end up doing it only on the times where there are other agenda items it kind of crayons could cram the opportunity we have to get into some issues and I kind of wanted to have a discussion about that before we decided whether or not it's not not a position that we shouldn't have a biology I mean excuse me a color change yeah it's not that it's that before we do that there's a discussion I think that's important for us to have and that's I was just trying to give us right some a couple of them um some time to have that it almost sounds like a work session on the community on the 18th to just have nothing else on the agenda including that motion to allow us time to do have that discussion on that would be what our role is and so I would look to you and maybe Mr Slater to come up with you know how you want that conversation to look like maybe we can talk before the meeting because I think y'all have some ideas that would be good to share with you yes I appreciate that it's just like I said my concern is not whether or not we actually go forward with the code change that we have the opportunity to have a discussion about the advisory role and how to organize that right before we so my emotion be I moved to amend the agenda and remove 6.2 and reschedule it for eight people we're gonna do this work session first April 18th so that's going to be on the same night right I don't think so I think you know to have a discussion first Maybe I don't see any yes I think it would be good to have the work session and then we'll schedule it for later it may maybe is going to make a motion to amend the agenda to remove 6.2 and reschedule it to the later date and to dress stack to schedule a work session on the Planning Commission advisory role for April 18th you could just say so lived second second by commissioner discussion on the motion did you actually want to move that or something else yes he would like that to happen and it's a good conversation for us to have any further comments on that machine if you're opposed commissioner egas commissioner Bott aye president Griggs aye commissioner Heller aye commissioner Levin aye commissioner Slater uh and commissioner of the year brandell thank you motion passes um public comments consent calendar do you have a motion yes I do um I moved to approve the minutes from the Planning Commission meeting on February 28th 2023. discussion on the motion Shelby will you please call the roll signify by saying I can't favor the motion Napier opposed commissioner egus aye commissioner Vaught aye president Griggs aye commissioner Heller abstain I didn't review the tape thank you commissioner Levin aye commissioner Slater aye and commissioner Brenda hi motion passed with one extension we don't have any resolutions or action items under 4.3 we have no public hearings moving on to 6.1 energy study on options during Purdue Washington Developers and I'm not sure if you're hooking them ment that she's working on as a note this is information as you saw on your agenda it's not an action line all right can everybody hear me yeah we can we do find stating your name and address for the record please certainly Rob Del Mar and I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of energy um and I'm coming to you from Bend Oregon oh lucky and I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person I often travel over the mountains to go to Salem but it didn't work out for me this week so thanks for and also thanks to commissioner Slater um bringing me to the meeting and getting this queued up and to Shelby for making the technology work at least so and I would like to share my screen to share a few slides these are slides from a presentation that I made to ascended energy committee shortly after the small scale Community Based energy project study was completed and it's just I think it's about six lines and so we can move through them pretty quickly and then hopefully move into more of a discussion or you know q a if there's any um any questions we there's one piece of work regarding small scale renewable energy but if you'd like to broaden the discussion Beyond just what's in the study that would be okay too but I think perhaps the study is a good way to kick this off so I'm going to come to share the screen these money um my screen certainly got a different look about it very well seeing a we're seeing the entire PowerPoint application not like presenter mode here we go the small scale community-based study was completed last fall and I like I said I'll go through these slides and then we can have a discussion if there are some questions kind of about broader small-scale renewable energy development study came out of house bill 2021 which directed Oregon Department of energy to convene a working group and cover barriers to project potential benefits of small-scale processed and ownership opportunities potential rate impacts and also potential legislation that could hopefully address some of the barriers and this is our representation on the work group I won't go through this whole list I know this is being recorded if anyone is interested in seeing who all was on there but we had a lot of work group members we had voices from from every position within kind of the small scale discussion including community group industry representatives from the solar wind and Israel industry we had utility Representatives folks who were interested",

        "text": " these we need to we were talking earlier about the importance of stories this is a big piece of it if we can listen to the ancestors if we can listen to the stories if we can tell the stories that has to you know be part of the institutional Control process and I don't think we're very good at that this is a thought I think looking at the clock probably need to wrap it up at that but um I look forward to we had lunch in the back we can continue discussing all of this uh amongst ourselves during the Lunch Period um thank you so much to the panelists and thank you Kermit and John for joining remotely uh and bearing with us with the AV uh challenges that we our staff here heroically worked through so it's one of the let's give a panelists everybody around Applause yeah so the next item on the agenda is Mr Trump's and he's going to give us the origins experience that something like that um I wanted to sort of sort of take a to the details of what's going to happen at advert look at what might happen and how Oregon might have a role in the in um in what's going to happen um so as soon as the slides get up we'll get started but uh not rushing anybody um a lot of what I'm going to be talking about has already been sort of broached so hopefully I'm coming at it from a slightly different angle speaking of different angles I hope no one Minds if I don't go up there and talk if I can sit here I'm closer to the L anyway for those of the folks online have to look at me on their computer so uh yeah so wanted to talk about what happens when active cleanup is done and we know that active cleanup is not clean um in the entire story of cleanup there's going to be cleanup that goes on after the last person has left the site uh doing a research work so we'll go to the next slide so I wanted to First say what do we know and what don't we know but we don't know what uh there's a lot of cleanup decisions that haven't been made yet there's a lot of records of decisions that haven't been cited yet and without those records of decision we don't know what the cleanup standards are we don't know how long the institutional controls or what institution would on what institutional controls are going to be um we do know that it's going to be one of the largest monitoring Scopes in history once this site transfers to Law Firm stewardship we obviously don't know when that's going to happen other than it will happen eventually um we don't need that hadn't been done yet no monitoring plans we don't know how the monitoring is going to happen has the monitoring technology that's going to be deployed in the 2100s been invented yet um is it going to be more cost effective to put a geosynchronous satellite over the site rather than having a force of 5 000 people going up to sample Wells every month um what kind of telemetry is going to be um and we don't know who's going to do it the office of Legacy Management's only 20 years old uh B reactors only 80 years old the country is about 250 years old whether you look at the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence you know looking at bureaucracy itself has only been around since what 3000 BC um the contaminants that we're talking about are going to be here longer than there's been bureaucracy 100 years is a really long place in bureaucracy space um let alone ten thousand so let's go to the next slide and talk about what we do we know that um the slides came out really weird on that but we know that the site is going to contain waste um the river might move around but hanford's still going to be there so we have to make sure that whatever decisions we make are taking into account the fact that Rivers move and Meander you know on the orders of centimeters or millimeters per year cutting into and depositing but it's going to happen over that time um 12 000 years ago is when the Missoula floods happen so that waste is still going to be there if 12 000 years in the future um and we we know why it's happening and we know it's it's happening because the federal government has a moral and legal requirement to do it um that we have to make sure that the the cleanup is protective of human health in the environment so next slide so you know okay um I must have taken a version from teams yeah there's there's some sections of their that go on there so um the question is how do we estimate what long-term stewardship will look like when we don't know anything but why and where um and so the answer we'll go to the next slide and that's some case studies um max brought up uh Rocky Flats uh which is an element Environmental Management site that turned to LM uh as a good case study um I personally have some experience working with LM because there is a site in Oregon that Legacy Management runs that we'll talk about as well so just sort of trying to figure out where the pieces fit together and then what's our role in it um so let's go to the next slide uh I had some fun with Google Earth and um these two little thumbnails I didn't zoom in or out so the one on the left is Rocky Flats the one on the right is Hanford so that's a sense of scale here um hampered's bigger uh Rocky Flats is about 20 000 acres and uh 1500 of that is sort of what we would think of as the central Plateau where it's going to be sort of a landfill that's managed by Legacy Management um they had a total of two operable units versus the 47 operable units at um seven billion dollars in cleanup budget at Rocky Flats 700 billion dollars at Hanford so a little bit different but even that seven billion dollar cleanup budget has a price tag of 452 million for Legacy Management operations for just 75 years so it's not um a one-to-one ratio but you know multiply that by a hundred and that's what 75 years worth of that's a lot of money um so let's go to the next slide yep is it today's daughters or um that is it was a CB uh a GAO report from I think um I apologize my my slide for many didn't come out well uh so um rocky flat stewardship had cleanup uh happening between 94 and 2005. Legacy Management took over in 2005 and there's institutional controls to prevent uh soil disturbance uh surface or groundwater use and activities that could damage landfill covers they do inspections of the for the institutional control and sampling the soil groundwater and they had either quarterly or annual reports depending on what they're monitoring um so it's been uh 15 18 years since Legacy Management and they're still doing quarterly and annual reports so it's not just the circle of five year review there's also as part of the institutional controls there's management plans that have different levels of of intricacy and Reporting requirements as we go um so let's go to the next line yeah so um that's Rocky Flats in an overview I'm not an expert on Rocky class I just those are the numbers that I could come up with that are closer to Hanford and sort of em to LM transfer Oregon has a Legacy Management site uh there's there was a uranium Mill that operated Lakeview in Lakeview Oregon uh and was cleaned up um under the Iranian Mill tailings remediation activities act okay yeah so we have a reviewing authority over the scope of work uh within the nuclear Regulatory Commission um and the the mine operated from the mines and Mill operated from the late 50s to late 70s and Remediation was completed in the late 80s it took cost about 25 million dollars uh so uh same trick with Google Earth now we're looking at Rocky Flats versus Lakeview so way smaller but uh I couldn't get um a lake view to Hanford comparison that it was like one pixel so uh our current activities involve an annual inspection of the uh 16 acre disposal cell uh there's an Institutional control in in the area of the formal former Mill that uh stops uh new groundwater Wells from being constructured in a certain Zone a certain Aqua Premiere there's groundwater monitoring it happens every two to four years um and the cell was designed for a thousand years but Legacy Management acknowledges that their responsibility for the safety and integrity of this Lakeview disposal cell will last so let's think about that we've got this really small site 16 Acres it was 25 million dollars to remediate and it's an infinite budget it will last indefinitely just a sense of scale here I'm a geologist so I like thinking long term and when we're look talking 75 years 250 million dollars for 75 years at Rocky 75 years is not very long um we're talking thousands of years of monitoring at these sites um so I guess the question then is where does that leave Oregon yeah oh yeah yeah I know yes just in terms of this continuing on and on and on for years there were Personnel changes within the agencies absolutely and had Oregon had Tom Department of energy not been proactive we'd have been left out yep just because people change don't understand what happened and I could see that happening again and again again so I I've been at this job for a little over four and a half years and I am now the senior boss person on the Lakeview sites yeah and all the other folks have turned over and I will say Legacy Management did a really good job at bringing the new manager up to speed and uh being you know having conversations about what do you know where can we find the stuff we need to know to get on the speed and they have had the same contracts within their work so there's there is some continuity um and and uh institutional knowledge is being transferred to them that gives me some hope all right so let's go to the next slide hey this won't work so my concept of what Oregon will be doing in amford for the next in 100 100 years plus so if Rocky Flats does quarterly about reports and has sampling plans and has annual reports I think there's probably going to be someone at Odo reading those reports and commenting on them to make sure that the river's being protected um it might not be a staff of six but it's going to be somebody on behalf of",

        "text": " has to have coming from outside of our um developer and for profit membership so our board is uh dominated by our our ngo members you know there are certain pieces of advocacy we've taken where we try to be extra careful to um you know actually run work product by for-profit members to make sure that um being thoughtful and trying to balance their potentially competing commercial interests but a lot of a lot of the work we do we do entirely in-house and we report out to our membership um and um you know that's i think the main difference is the the the level of independence and staff drivenness of the work that we do so think if i can follow up on that um so do you have any um make any efforts to communicate with the public where your members are certainly looking for property security property do you have any of that public participation again do not do any work like that on a project specific basis so we certainly don't you know help developers identify landowners or communicate in that way we're not a grassroots organization we don't have individual members to speak of we do public engagement through you know talking to reporters and that sort of thing but no and i wasn't talking about project specific it was just generally i mean clearly you're focused on renewable projects and your membership is um who we hear a lot from are the is the public who's impacted by the projects and may not like them and i'm just wondering what groundwork you you might do as an organization different in the trade organization um or trade association um to you know catch that public perception input whatever on the front generally not specifically yeah so sorry it took me a second to understand um but that is an excellent question that's actually something that um we've been thinking a lot about internally and we've actually just hired a new position for our organization a stakeholder outreach manager her name is emily griffith she starts on monday and that's exactly you know what her role is going to be is connecting with all of the affected stakeholders throughout the region um and trying to make sure that we we're hearing some of the same things that you're hearing uh but ideally we get to sort of contested proceedings in front in front of uh you know entities like the council and really trying to do as much consensus building as we can you know outside of these kinds of formal proceedings and to that end also diane has been working hard on a consensus building exercise here in oregon smart sighting can never remember what the c is diag yeah that's working with um organ solutions out of portland state university on the nrdc and some other defenders of wildlife so yeah that kind of stakeholder engagement and attempt to identify uh consensus is increasingly important um and something that we're really trying to put more resources into okay thank you for that and i do have some other questions but um yeah i'll let others okay does anyone besides cindy have questions comment chair grill this is perry choco yes terry um i just i don't have a question but i got a comment actually a couple of them and i i think i think the state of oregon needs to uh energy generation out on the ocean because what we've done is we've uh made it to where you could see lake county and klamath county from space with all the solar projects out here um it and the wind energy is super destructive to uh animals to birds bees bats kneading of flies um through a a little news piece that was sent to us it showed in another state how destructive the wind energy production can be and so um i i would a member of a tribe and having a part of my family be here for hundreds of generations and just in the past few years seeing lake county have multiple solar projects klamath county have multiple solar projects and and knowing that energy produced by those projects are utilized in oregon that it mostly travels to california i i have to say as an oregonian and a member of a tribe um that um we need we maybe we need to uh explore other possibilities because we're we're running out of ground to put solar projects on now and so it's you know it it kind of affects you when i like when i used to go dig roots out there in lake county now it's all fenced off and you know people that live in the surrounding area have to put up with that shine from them solar panels and it's not like we're talking about one or two talking about 20 plus and then climate count is getting as bad as that so i just wanted to say that you know and i don't mean any offense by i'm just speaking by what i know and what i see and what i feel and they hear from my and so i just wanted a chance to say that today and i i appreciate your thank you very much for the time thank you thank you for your comments perry other comments and cindy i'm hearing none you said you had additional comments i i do and i'm not sure um either you can answer this question but um when does securing of actually the securing of property happen and i'll just give you the context for my question is as things are heating up as you describe no pun intended i guess with respect to projects um that it seems to me there's some competitive it gets increasingly competitive with limited um space to do these projects and so if a developer goes out uh to a landowner and says hey we want to do this property this project that uh we want to secure uh an agreement with you and there's no they're not leasing it's just an agreement that oh sure i'll sign the agreement that you know will allow you to do something on my my property um it's not there's nothing secured on the developer side there's no payment being made somebody else comes in and talks to the landowner and says hey um we want to do a property or a development um and your property is included when does that what does that come to loggerheads when does the is the property owner uh bound or how the how are those disputes um so and it seems to me if they secure and start these payments that's a pretty that's a a pretty firm deal but before that it seems really kind of up in the air for the property owner do you know when they when the when a firm lease for property happens that's a a good question and um i think that the answer that i have is it it depends i don't think it's something that's set in stone from um my understanding um uh of the process but partly because it can be speculative and pretty far advanced of when they're actually going to be developing it maybe they're more a bit more proactive on the ground than maybe um or they're the first ones there wanting to secure all the good sites i think it's squishy it's not exactly set in stone from from what i understand it's not a very satisfactory answer it just strikes me that the developers know kind of these timelines we know the timelines now with a better understanding given your presentation and the people that are out without much information are the property owners um that have the real asset of the property itself and um that that's kind of the foundation of my earlier question is is there much outreach uh for these individual property owners to even know how long the process can take and that it is a more competitive market and be aware of what you're signing when you sign a document so and i realize that's not your your deal but um it's the public that comes into us so and essentially like like i said in answer to your earlier question i do think it's increasingly important you know we as diane highlighted from the ipcc report i think what we're seeing right now is the start of what is likely to be even more applications coming your way even more projects and development and not only is it fundamentally important to do that in a uh just and thoughtful way uh but also from a sort of pragmatic getting the projects we need built perspective uh that's not going to happen if communities are opposed or concerned or unhappy with the projects that are getting developed it is not something we have historically done a lot of i think it is something that we as an organization will probably do more of trying to talk to communities help people understand um you know how this process works things to look out for things that can benefit them um and kind of just to go back to your question about you know the lease payments being like a clear point of delineation um i do understand i have not worked for a developer i have not done project development um so my understanding is somewhat abstract but i think it's it's fairly common for um developers to go out and um obtain lease options where there is some initial payment to a property owner in exchange for the right to exercise that option and enter into a lease in the future if they do proceed with development on a site so there there are places like in between the totally squishy handshake that you talked about and the like firm lease with regular payments coming in um and there are ways to navigate that that can be potentially beneficial to both um but i don't know for sure how often that happens i just know it does happen okay thank you thank you for that it's just been a curiosity of minus when when does it really uh the rubber hit the road for the property owner who's who's allowing it so and then i just have one more um question and it relates to um how you see or you and your members see fsac and just as i i view f sex process as pretty tight with pretty tight timeline lines and uh to do the work this significant amount of work that needs to be done and how do your members see f sex process in terms of in light of the timeline that you just certainly focused on here today how do you see f sex uh timeline within that more comprehensive timeline that's a great question um i would say increasingly your assessment of it being pretty tight i think is increasingly an observation from what i'm hearing from our members because of those things that are taking longer after the site certificate so the off take the interconnection the questions around materials procurement you know finding all the labor and everything is getting all that done in the three years for start of the three years works if everything goes and so uh that that would be one observation general observation that i would share um for that and and sorry i should have i i view the tightness as for staff oh that too",

        "text": " project as well. So we spent a lot of time looking at the west side. Now I'm going to kind of go over to the west side. All along the south side, we either have our existing building or existing Marco Polo buffers that we just continued around. Like for example, around the mobile home park. We just brought the same buffer that Marco Polo has on their east side to their north side and ran that through staff and thought that that would be all right. But on the west. So on the west is where we really looked at. What is the best buffer we can put forward over there? So as I talked about, we have some neighbors over here. Our neighbor is actually 29th Avenue Road. On the other side of the road. We have some larger properties near our entrance and then some homes up here to the west and down to our corner, there's actually a lot of 29th Avenue from there down to 484 that we're not adjacent to. That's future development area for somebody else. There's a mix of hardwoods, pine trees, understory, vegetation. It's actually a pretty good buffer in that area as far as the COVID goes. And so our thought was we were just going to put a 50 foot undisturbed buffer in that area. We don't think we can tear that down and plant a better buffer. And I've got a couple pictures to follow this up to show you what we're looking at out there. I will point out that along one portion of the project, there's a strip of old Jimy. Tell me if I call it the right thing, but Deltona buffer strip, if you will, preserve area. It's a 50 foot wide preserve area that cannot be developed under the county comp plan. A guy bought it at a tax deed sale thinking it was worth something. He can't use it, but he didn't want to sell it to us. But the point is, is that along that northern part about from where that arrow is north, that's another area that can't be developed. But that's not in a 50 foot you're talking about, though. You're talk about. We're. In addition to that, I just want to make sure you'renn have almost 100ft of no touch there. Yep. No 50 foot connected to your property. So our property just in that strip just has an additional 10ft of buffer behind it so that we've got a strip there that's ours. So there'll be that 60ft there. What we did was we extended that 50 foot all the way down our property so there'd be a continuous, undisturbed buffer on the west side. Okay, question. Because there was some there in the presentation, there was a comment about four laning 29th. Yes, ma'am. What happens when you. Four lane 29th, where is that coming from? So the four laing 29th, and we do have some specific stuff on this in the presentation, will happen from the entrance to the south. Okay. Not about lots of the north. It's already four lineaned up there. Yeah, some of it is. It kind of peters out after a little while. It's not really been used as a four lane, even though there's some pavement out there. Okay. All right. It's the one that's got that weird kind of median. It's like a half boulevard. I don't know what that is? But all the traffic is on the west side, right? Yeah. So it's a four lane row with only two lanes. We'll be clean. We'll be cleaning something like that. All right, this is what the west buffer is going to look like. And I showed you a rendering followed by a picture earlier just to kind of show you the work that we're putting into putting these together. So this is kind of the actual vegetation that exists out there. Based on the height of the building and where it's going to sit on the plan, this would be just south of our entrance. That's actually what it will look like. So it sits back a good ways. And we have that 50 foot buffer over there. And this is looking at it kind of one was looking at it looking north. This is kind of looking south. So we're able to take the site plan and turn it into three d and actually get a good idea of what. And when we saw this, we thought we had the right buffer. So we're proposing the no touch buffer on. On the western side. Rick, is there any issue with the mobile home park? Did you talk to those guys? I don't think there's any issue. We talked to them a little bit when transesterern was being developed down to the south, making sure that they knew where the buffer that was coming. There's actually no connection between the properties. Even though the road kind of comes up there, you can't actually get there. So. Thank you. Yes, sir. This is the last slide that I'll have. I'm sorry, Kathy. I'll bet you had another question. No, no, no. You're good. You're answering them, commissioner. You are good. You're good, right? The last slide that I'm going to hit before we'll have my partner, Amber Gartner, come up and talk about transportation. Analysis is just the environmental consideration. So we're close to the greenway. This is a full pud master plan. So we have done, I think, ten different environmental site visits. We've generated three reports. We've gone back and looked at two different specific species to see if we could do that even further. That's all been submitted to staff as part of this application. We found gopher tortoises and a black bear out there. We were able to locate scrub jays on greenway property, but not on this property because the conditions and the ground are very different. We have to apply for all kinds of federal, state, and local permits for environmental. Our biologist is here in the audience and would be glad to answer any specific questions that you have. She's just glad to be in air conditioning. We usually have her out in the field, so. But all of this has been turned in because this is a full. She s looking for Sanskings. Okay, we're good on Sands case, but this is already part of the application. I just want toa point that out. Caus I don't think you all are used to getting this as part of your application packages. All right, we're gonna make that a requirement moving forward. It is a requirement of a pud master plan. It is ma be in the presentation, too. All right, let me turn this over. If you don't have any further questions, let me turn this over to Amber Gartner. She's going to walk you through our transportation analysis work. All right. Good afternoon. Amber Gartner. Kimley Horn, 1700 southeast 17th Street, Ocala. As was previously mentioned, we did do a full traffic impact analysis as part of this pud master plan application that included, at the beginning of the process, making sure we had our approach signed off by staff. We concluded that traffic study in December of last year. We did go through a couple of rounds of back and forth with staff and they finally approved that in February of this year. Some of the points were already made, but as part of this study, we had to look at anything that was significant. Significant impacted predominantly. That includes County Road 484 and the major intersections. As was pointed out, our access will be to the west, to a new connection to 29th Avenue Road at Marion Oaks Trail, and at the existing signalized intersection of 20th Avenue Road and County Road 484. When we were developing the site to the south, we had already talked with staff about constructing this 20th Avenue Road connector, and ultimately, the thought was the county really wanted a parallel route for residents to travel in this area and not have to utilize 484 as much. So the county is really interested in having this roadway connection all the way through to Marion Oaks Trail, not only for the purpose of our site operations, but also to allow for other use of residents and theuting public. So I'm going to step through a few of the findings and recommendations of the study, and this is what is incorporated into the concurrency development agreement. Just to orient you, this is the existing building that is nearing completion. This red line is the 20th Avenue Road project that has been constructed. As part of that first phase, we will be continuing that 20th Avenue extension over to 29th Avenue Road. And we just really want to highlight that this provides, again, another alternate route in seamless transportation for people to get from that 49th Avenue corridor that's currently under construction over to this area, either for employment at our property or continuing through to only have to be on 484 for a short time period. Why is that? We've all driven out there. 49th Avenue Road is another county project that is going to provide relief to traffic on both I 75 and State Ro 200 for residents living in Marion Oak seek employment in other areas. One key reason, as was already mentioned, we have this kind of rear entrance is to allow for this abundant employment to be able to come in through an alternate route and not have ever have to get onto County Road 484. I think there's a question before about distribution of traffic and what we're expecting both from our employment as well as the trucks. This site, depending on use it'have, anywhere between 15, up to 22% of trucks depending on the time of day. We did consider that and we really see the 20th Avenue Road intersection as being the main entrance for our trucks because they're predominantly coming from I 75 and",

        "text": "regon's weed controls weed control laws that enforcement authority lies with the county courts the council is not waiving compliance with the weed control laws by findings that the proposed facility would comply with the fish and wildlife habitat the hearing officer also found that the applicant is only obligated to address um in other words prevent and mitigate noxious weed infestations that result from the proposed facility the africans not obligated to address pre-existing or subsequent noxious weeds within the site boundary that exist outside project related areas of use or the applicant is committed to identifying controlling treating and monitoring noxious weed species listed on oregon wheat board class a b and t lists and county class b lists a and b lists in the contested case proceeding um the company updated its draft noxious weed plan including additional requirements of the plan that require the company to consult annually with county weed districts regarding treatment if any for class c and on any updates to staton county weed lists to be reflected in their noxious weed plan the draft noxious weed plan identifies that the applicant would monitor at least once annually for the first five years after year five the company would prepare location-specific long-term monitoring plans for noxious weed control the hearing officer found that nothing in the weed control statute specifically requires twice annual monitoring and finally that os 569 that deals with wheel washing is limited to other machinery used for agricultural purposes and does not apply to construction equipment or vehicles okay that is the summary of the hearing officer's ruling on that issue and uh we can have oral argument uh from ms gilbert or miss gear whoever wants to come first anyway am i okay here i guess i can be heard um the applicant i'm going to just deal with the one issue here which is that weeds are not allowed to go to seed this requirement is necessary to comply with the oregon statute also with f stack rules requiring that the development not significantly increase the cost to the county which includes the cost of nox suite control and compliance with the habitat standard requiring the plan to assure that the development will not result in infestations of noxus weeds and resulting damage to wildlife habitat and that conditions be imposed that require monitoring mitigation to assure compliance with the standards the weed supervisors from three counties information saying that idaho power must comply with state law regarding control of noxious weeds on lands they manage or hold right of way on regardless of cause or pre-existence the same as any other land odfw mr reif stated weed management should occur on all project areas for the life of the project the risk of reinfection in the areas of operation and areas of revegetation will remain high for the life of the project the current weed management plan fails to meet the requirements that weeds not be allowed to go to seed or comply with state statutes and rules including requiring annual monitoring for the life of the project to ensure noxious weeds are not allowed to go to seed and invest other areas the procedure for finalizing the management weed management plan fails to comply with the requirements for council approval of the weed management plan to show the statutes and rules are complied with the agency review process being required is controlled by the oregon department of energy and detailed requirements for counties or agencies to disagree with the drafts presented by the developer include identifying a rule that specifically requires the change and providing only a 14-day time frame for review and objection to what's submitted i'm going to read the rule that keeps getting referred to in terms of odo being able to finalize these plans 469 402 delegation of review of future action required by site certificate if the energy facilities citing council elects to impose conditions on a site certificate or an amended site certificate that requires subsequent then they can refer it to the odo that's what the rule says the language is referring to the fact there is a site certificate now says at the conclusion of the contested case the shall issue a final order either approving or rejecting the application based upon the standards adopted in or 469 501 and what's in the uh the project order so the bottom line is yes odo can do some follow-up but not until the council actually issues a site certificate that is your responsibility your duty they can only do the actions that you have included after you decide that there is eligibility for the site certificate so with these plans if they are required in order to issue a site certificate that's your responsibility they can draft it you have to approve it so thank you miss gilbert are there any questions from council okay yeah this applies all across the board you know that miss gear oh she got a haircut for uh fish and wildlife three and fish and wildlife six so mister for the record dog cornet mr vice chair um so miss gear has provided a uh recording for issues fw3 and fw6 but they're one six minute long uh recording okay um so what i would request is a little alteration here which would be to play the entire recording of this gear which is six minutes and then allow idaho power six minutes to respond to both of the issues as well as mr rowe six minutes to respond to both issues and then you would do a straw poll on a combination of those issues and there's nobody else this is it okay that works friendly amendment to that proposal and that's that before we hear the recording that'll cover both issues maybe i should see what the second issue is okay so um issue fw6 again the the single limited party on this issue is uh susan gear is whether the noxious weed plan provides adequate mitigation for potential loss of habitat due to noxious when it appears to relieve the applicant of weed monitoring and control responsibilities after five years and allows for compensatory weed compensatory mitigation if weed control is unsuccessful the hearing officer addressed this in her opinion and ruled that no council standard requires prevention or eradication of non-native invasive species in natural areas further the treatment of non-native invasive plant species as a matter outside of council jurisdiction the noxious weed control plan would require noxious weed monitoring and control annually to minimum for the first five years and then requires development of a long-term monitoring plan after year five which is consistent with other revegetation and weed control plans approved by the council ms gear has not demonstrated that the noxious weed plan is inadequate for the purpose of controlling noxious weeds susan gear issues fw3 and fw6 i've been a botanist in plant community colleges for over 30 years i'm a landowner who controls weeds and who assists in vegetation management at rice glass hill natural area i asked the council to deny the site certificate or remand the proposed contested case order to judge webster for more evidence and amanda odo for updated analysis and further development of the various plans i'm adopting ms gilbert's exceptions for fw3 plus the following judge webster aired when she summarized effects of residual herbicides on native plant communities was omitted from the i have great concerns for the effects of residual herbicides on native plant large amounts of herbicides would be used to address invasive plants resulting from disturbance of this important concern was not addressed in any of the other issues or discussed in the plans the draft noxious weed the reclamation and revegetation or the vegetation management plan proposed in the application for site certificate this concern should be part of the discussion of habitat standards exception for fw6 judge webster aired in how she addressed fw6 she failed to address the potential loss of habitat and the type of mitigation the compensatory mitigation raised in fw6 and by incorrectly limiting the scope of fw6 with prejudicial wording in her even beyond the limited wording she originally chose for the issue in the amended order the judge's conclusion of law states the updated draft noxious week plan is adequate to serve its intended purpose of establishing the measures the company will take to control noxious wheat species and prevent the introduction of these species during construction and the operation of the project this gear has not presented evidence for a persuasive argument to show that the noxious weak plan is invalid or that idaho power will be unable to implement and adhere to the plan when finalized this conclusion completely ignores the loss of habitat which is central to the in a letter to the judge dated october 1st 2020 i applied appealed for and gained recognition of this very issue the following issue is not mentioned by odo but is recognized as properly raised by idaho power in response to petitions for party status 2d fish and wildlife habitat standard mitigation for potential habitat loss from noxious weeds whether the new action in the proposed order allowing idaho power to mitigate for potential loss of habitat due to noxious weeds is an adequate solution to the risk of narcissus weed impacts the judge was able to draw this conclusion only because she chose to reword and prejudicially narrow the scope of fw6 in her opinion the judge's opinion states idaho power is not required to demonstrate compliance with the weed control laws to satisfy fish and wildlife habitat the judge incorrectly assumes that compliance with weed control laws is the only factor related to disturbance in invasives that would affect habitat the opinion is moved because without beginning construction idaho power could not demonstrate compliance all they can do is demonstrate a willingness to comply at least in writing loss of high quality native habitat would occur under the proposed order there is no mitigation that can atone for unique high quality native habitat this is particularly true for rice glass hill natural area which has been undisturbed and developed and managed solely for native plants and animals for over 20 years and has special status species and priority plant associations the judge draws faulty conclusions about mitigation for loss of habitat and compensatory mitigation the judge offers as previously discussed issue fw6 is limited to whether the noxious weak plan provides adequate mitigation for potential adverse effects from noxious weeds resulting from project construction and or operation the judge has replaced the words loss of habitat found in her initial wording of the issue with adverse impacts taking the issue even further from my concerns as initially expressed the judge further dismisses concerns about habitat loss because of invasive plants by focusing only on the words noxious weave plan in her view the noxious weed plant is the",

best for this to work whether that's splitting payments so if solar goes in first but storage goes in later we can pay out for part of the solar whether it's extending um a reservation so that you have longer to complete the project or increasing the cap so that folks aren't waiting for that storage to come on before being able to pick up another application out there right is that does that sound like the approach yeah exactly we're gonna align the definitions with what was changed in the legislative legislature uh and then we're gonna need to see if there's other tweaks to be made to the rules to make that uh change in the definitions kind of more effective throughout the rest of the program and how contractors can uh install the solar it looks like Angela has a hand up so we can hear from Angela um this idea anyone else that has thoughts on this it's a great time to share we'll also have time at the end so you don't have to chat now but we can talk it talk it through and then we'll concentration in a minute after Angela goes um I don't have any a question at this time but I have some comments is this the right time to comment on those ideas is it if it's on like what we're talking about on this slide that'd be great yeah um yeah that's fine go ahead okay well um thank you by the way if you're thinking of these ideas um I really like options A and B um having both of them I think would be ideal I think it would be helpful to the contractors to have those payments split um timing can be uncertain of when the actual product will arrive and extending that reservation as well um when there is um need need for it I mean I nobody wants to extend their reservations too long because they'd like to move on to the next project so it doesn't seem like that would be um something that would be misused or something like that I think those two are appropriate I'm not sure on on C my kind of first reaction is that that's not needed and there I think some of my members would have concerns that if more reservations were allowed for non-income restricted reservations that it could make these funds be depleted faster but I'm not sure I'd like to get some feedback from folks and be interested in what others have to say great thanks Angela and then we can go to Trisha I'm Trisha I'll let you know when it looks like you're off mute your afternoon now so my name is I'm with prostat electric installer um these are these proposed or these changes that are the set rules now these are proposed just kind of flowing out options uh to kind of get feedback on right now uh and there'll be another comment period after we draft up some rules so this is like still very early in the process um the statute doesn't become effective until the start of 2024 and our rules could not become effective before then as well so this is kind of um still early in the information gathering okay um one question I had is with the um you talked about separating solar and um I'm I'm assuming that means application process as well um would storage up no so the application would come in the same way with solar Plus Storage um so if somebody's getting both storage is not like a separate add-on they have to be um sort of purchased together but they can be installed separately is that is the change in statute and really it's to solve a problem we heard about with you but with solar materials being more available but storage sometimes the battery taking longer to come in due to supply chain issues and so not having the idea really is to figure out how can we make it so that installers aren't on the hook sort of waiting for that storage to come in to get paid for the solar piece of the rebate if that makes sense gotcha okay but you can go on I just didn't want you to like you may like go on with the assumption that was not the case oh well all I was gonna say in in that regards is if the applications would have its own separate cue so that um I know you were thinking about increasing the overall um like uh application queue for for the contractor of how many they can have um at a time and I was just wondering you know if they were going to be separated if there'd be a storage queue and then a solar queue so that you can kind of separate the storage is going to be set aside and it's not going to affect other amount of applications that you can have coming in but it sounds like it's going to be in the same queue so if you pay out if you do the split payment and the what the contractors having to wait on the storage um typically if I can remember correctly because it's been a while but an application is considered in your queue until it's completed so wouldn't that add to if we're paid out solar but you're still waiting to pay out storage but in the meantime the contractor is having to count that as part of their just something for Thought yeah yeah that's why we have the third option there like maybe that that's another place where we can increase the cap or something you might be onto an idea here with like okay you're waiting for storage so maybe there's sort of uh you're moving into like a different queue or something that might be an interesting idea for us to think about right James or maybe even just put a different type of status that moves it out in power Clerk um so it's not part of a queue anymore but it goes into a separate status I don't know how it works but me neither Trisha but Katie and Dale and James can talk about that but I think that that that's what we're kind of getting out with that number three okay okay yeah so thanks for the thoughts it's really great yep and we had somebody in the queue but they're gone Frankie G I guess your your question must be answered so with that I don't see I do see one new oh Frankie went into the chat here we go um they're wondering if the vendors be different companies like would they be able to hire a contractor for solar panel installation and then on their own purchase of an idiom flow battery from a um vendor and if so reimbursed or would the payment go to store n does that question make sense you can look at it in the chat too um so it's a little different difficult with uh necessary of bit more context but uh rebates are only able to be um applied for by a eligible contractor um the contractor would be um applying for the rebate and having purchased the the solo and the storage system together so I need to kind of dive into specifics of what we say in the role but the I need to kind of look back at that but it basically would be the same company um there would be installing the same contractor I think the question might be does it need to be the same supplier for the solar panels is for the storage is how I read the question which is different can try again with the raised hand and we can get them off mute if that'd be helpful because I think we are yeah let's go ahead and bring in Frankie you're off of you uh addressing my question I'm I'm not a contractor I'm I'm just I guess one of those non-lmi um just a residential person uh homeowner who is interested in getting onto the solar panel stuff and I was doing research I think the biggest uh whole thing that's been holding me back is that Storage Solutions are are not really up to par and I'm not really liking what's the common uh storage solution right now which is lithium ion and I heard that Vanadium I was I I looked at some Alternatives and Vanadium flow it seems to be the best out there for long term and reliable non-draining so many factors uh I guess I could look into the contractor it sounds like what you're saying is I need to um hire a contractor that Oregon uh doe approves of um I guess what I would hope then is I could work with them to buy the storage uh that I want and if they can't uh I guess I'll just have to wait for vanadium flow to become more popular so that they might consider it so thank you you'd have to do the purchase through your contractor but hopefully you can find a contractor that'd be willing to work with you cool on getting what you want excellent thank you that answered my question we've got to be purchased from the same um but yeah the contractors should be able to help great well with that we can go ahead and move on to the next slide Thanks James and everyone for the good questions in the comments um so other proposals uh and there were kind of uh proposing in uh for Amendment uh include increasing the number of low or moderate income residential customer or low income service provider reservations a contractor can have at a time from 20 to 25. we're also proposing to increase the amount of time a reservation for low-income service provider can be uh for one from a one-year reservation with a possible extension of 180 days to again that one year reservation with a possible extension of an additional year um this is again due to the feedback that low-income service provider projects have been delayed due to supply chain and Workforce constraints um that would be like a an extra 180 days there to get those projects complete uh but again looking for feedback whether that is um would be helpful um an additional rule change being proposed is to reduce the residential rebate rate for customers who are not",

        "text": " haven't played around with any cost assumptions like we put them in and kind of ran with it and this is the numbers we have we can you know do do a sensitivity analysis around those different those different fuel prices and obviously you know if you like quadruple the natural gas price and and then run the numbers you could see what impacts that would have kind of on on each of those scenarios and how that would change and um and but you know I'll leave that up to Alan and chair McDonald because I I mean I know that's probably part of their plan in the future but we haven't kind of got to that phase of the project yeah so so take into consideration this is a long-term model it's 28 years through 2050 uh so that as a long-term uh perspective to it the our uh assumption is that the the gas prices gasoline prices and and uh natural gas prices are a blip that come back down into the model um so they don't we don't account for that uh and mostly because we started the modeling before this happened and it would have been difficult to go back and do it then we might be able to do that in the next round but ha saying that that just makes the benefits go up because then you're offsetting higher cost fuels and so the benefits that you're seeing on this slide in the next slide are actually would then increase because you're offsetting them and the greenhouse gas emissions basically you might go down a bit because of elasticity people use less with higher um with regard to the actions that need to be taken for the CPP and HP 2021 the fact that greenhouse gas emissions our our model starts at 2019 because that was the that's the last official greenhouse gas emissions inventory that Oregon has they're about to publish the next one but we don't have that one yet so we started there and uh and and uh if it did go up and it did go up in 2021 down in 20 up in 21 and probably maybe up a little bit in 22. for meeting the requirements of the law associated with the reductions in CPP and HB 2021 it just makes that a little bit more difficult they have to do more to get to that level in order to meet the legal requirements that are set forth in those two programs and rules and laws so in the end as you get down into the later years you end up in the same place with regard to how much emission reductions we still need to get you can play with prices and we can show the impacts of those of price jumps on on the model and the financial results for sure and that would just increase the benefits the net benefit great so this you could think of this as that's a good point for us to make sure we reflect in the report um Pat I think you're up next great thank you uh Patty laquell again I'm trying to understand these Financial metrics better uh you've already said that you're not including any cost for a hydrogen capital investment in terms of the production technology uh are these metrics only for the demand side of the energy system do they comp you know include any supply-side Investments at okay good thank you but it does include buying that hydrogen at a price right right that but that's an amortized to that price are embedded in that price sure sure I understand that explicit it's it's it's uh it's it's but it's still an amortized price it doesn't include the impact of having to make a one-time investment in a capital facility that you're going to get a return over time but I understand the I just wanted to be clear though this is really just a demand side uh look at the Energy System okay uh we'll make sure we uh clarify this in the report any other questions let's see if there are hands up I don't see any don't see anything in the chat and we might remind me if yeah here we go we've got more slides how many weeks there's a couple more sides and again it's just all you know fill in fill in the time between questions you know I guess you know the other output is these marginal maintenance cost curves so basically taking for each of the actions we uh and policies we um well like a majority of them have uh you know costs associated them and Emissions reductions and this is kind of how they play out um so again we talked about this at the last meeting so I won't dive too much into that another way of looking at it is so you can see you know the the investment required and versus the Net implementation so just just some placeholder kind of slides questions or or yeah where where you know that that's kind of where I'm at so wherever you all want to take it it's a great great discussion in the question so far it's been it's been awesome uh great um there's a question from Jay um Linda can you elevate day I'll just read it out how does petroleum fuel storage come into playing with modeling you'd be able to unmute now are you able to hear me now yeah yes yeah okay thank you so much um my name is Jay Wilson I'm a local emergency manager but was the former chair for the state seismic commission when we produced the Oregon resilience plan and I worked for a couple of years um with the National Institute of standard and Technology on their Community resilience planning for the nation a few years ago and so from a resilience perspective I would so appreciate the work that's going on here for greenhouse gas reduction but I wanted to ask about really with the the critical energy infrastructure Hub that's at the North End of the Willamette River the 500 tanks that hold over 300 million gallons of oil does the status of this facility come into any of your um for 2035 and 2050 and uh the reason I ask is I uh have been involved in in work over the past three years that's demonstrated that if this facility fails in an earthquake it's not only going to be an um a fuel shortage but it's going to create an environmental catastrophe that could be the worst oil spill in U.S history uh in the Willamette and Lower Columbia right after an earthquake and with no means to address it and I think that there is a Nexus here between seismic policy climate change policy Environmental Protection and leverage uh from all of these to work together collaboratively to build a case for reducing the risk and the reason and purpose to get to the goals that you're promoting but I haven't heard this folded together as an argument or a way to articulate it and I wondered whether the commission might hold the status of the CEI Hub at 2035 or 2050 drawing it down decommissioning it in a commensurate way with the less dependency on greenhouse gas production so therefore there's win-wins going on if we can fold these policies together and have these different camps and different silos come together and work more uh proactively in the policy Arena and and the visioning arena and I hope this very concisic kind of question and statement of mine makes sense it does thank you for that you know maybe collectively we could make sure we have a a good path forward to avoid that kind of a impact I might add that while this the Tigger analysis doesn't take that explicitly into consideration might be something the commission want to look at but in a in a different Forum the Oregon Department of energy is right now scoping a an update to our more than a decade old energy security plan uh which would look at all forms of energy and uh and look at climate vulnerability assessments as well as earthquakes and cyber impacts on on energy security uh and and potentially looking at Solutions uh and and issues that need further investigation so that that's a 20 23 20 24 plan that we're scoping right now and and problem and and seeking funding for in the tune of probably a million dollars uh to really do that up well uh so what you're talking about Jay could would be addressed in that plan but probably not in this one that's great Ellen thank you for adding thank you so much thank you scheduled until four we don't need to stay on until four but I want to make sure we one thing that might help um is maybe Chris for you to just show people the big spreadsheet that you have and kind of how to navigate through it which I I think I thought we posted that spreadsheet the action spreadsheet I was thinking more that like all the costing and the assumptions and oh uh okay well let me see um the the one that has like uh the like the wedges and stuff in it and the financials yeah I think so you want to lift each action separately that you've been developing the scenarios with oh yeah that's not quite that's not filled out yet but we don't have that ready yet oh okay that's my bad yeah what we're building for everybody is listening to this internal conversation revealing especially that list each action in each of the scenarios and then lists uh how much the capital cost or how much greenhouse gas emissions it reduces how much the capital cost is what's the the the uh Energy savings what's the O M savings and what's the net cost and then also we're looking at and we'll put the source of that information into the into the into the uh spreadsheet so yeah here's the unfield filled out filled out right it'll have all the detail about each individual action because the way that we got to the scenario net benefit cost calculation is is adding up each of the actions net cost net benefit net right and so this that is that's the sum of this all this so we have this data we just haven't put it in the right format yet yeah this product will be coming soon okay perfect thank you any other questions about the model assumptions how the model works one of the elements of the model that I'm uh excited about is is the fact that it's built from the counties up and so I think as we are able to look more at you know the pluses and minuses of different policies um in you know different parts of Oregon you know that will help us think about how to uh design programs to have the best benefits over the state overall yeah Chris can do you have that presentation up so you can pull up either the the health benefits or the jobs one with the two graph spatial graphs for the state that like Kathy said it does get built up each County and then aggregated to get to",

        "text": " annually and at any time annually if it's found that through work with a consultant or otherwise the contingencies are found to be too or perhaps too low that they can be adjusted annually only if you want them to as of as of right now the only thing that the conditions the standard condition for evaluating the bond or letter of credit over time is for inflation otherwise we say i mean and they so we have a an estimate right now of 39 million dollars that's based on full build out so the condition allows for a reduction based on final number of components but that's it not changing methods and typically we've specified the contingencies are maintained now i think it's um on the table if a re-evaluation is something council wants on some frequency yeah and so um so it's a little different but just so you know in umatilla county's development code um their lan their conditional use criteria for wind facility they have a set of criteria that's kind of similar to councils but it establishes that that decommissioning estimate has to be evaluated every three years and so for the wind component there already is for this project a re-evaluation now that is i would have to double check but it's intended to be like on the methods for about like the the methods for the cost estimate per task in action not necessarily project management fees but i think it's certainly possible that we could interweave that of ongoing reevaluation for all for the whole thing cindy conan again i i i would encourage that approach i i'm i'm support being consistent with what we've done in the past but certainly look at me perhaps a different model for the future now the interesting thing about that though is it would be a re-evaluation that odo would have to do but the developer is tied to which that is always a little messy if you know there's a compliance issue because we don't do something and we know what they want our project management fees to be so i i think this is an interesting issue just as the applicant stated in their comments that this is a kind of a new world for everyone including f-sec and what's going to happen in maybe 30 years 25 30 35 years whatever nobody knows and um so i think looking at different options they may be messy but maybe worth it um but i'd be supportive of keeping our contingencies at what they what they have been in the past and what is what uh staff is proposed here thank you and i'll pass it back to kate one more sorry true grout cindy conden another issue related to retirement assurance not related to the estimate but related to the security instrument and in the letter we received today it capital powers capital power has committed to providing the financial assurance outlined in exhibit m of the and i appreciate that i just want um to make sure again and i think i'm reading it correctly the articles of incorporation for nolan whatever security is provided nolan hill it's just not in the name of capital power it it recognizes nolan hills as our applicant and the project um entity so thank you madam chair yes todd for the record todd i just want to go back to make sure that we have the um sort of direction um on the prior kind of conversation so you know the question on contingency you heard a couple council members say you're fine with the current contingency um is that the case with everybody it's never involved and and so there was also the question of you know should we bring that to our consultant to evaluate just stick with the contingencies as are as they are proposed in the draft proposed order so madam chair this is hanley i think you need to stick with what you have now um in draft proposed order and if there is an interest in changing those contingencies i think we need to talk about a different process so so we stick with the contingencies as are we don't go to our consultant and then the question of does the entire sort of the financial assurance you know bond amount kind of amount and details do we reevaluate that on a every three-year basis for the entire facility or do we just leave that for the wind consistent with the umatilla county code cindy condon for the record i think a review every three years but does that have to be decided with respect to this application or can we discuss it further based on maybe the review of a consultant or if we're going to work with a consultant can you decide that at that time uh yeah i mean you could and i think just from because we're at this place in this process if you wanted to apply to this it's probably best to put that in now but if you you know sort of at the point where you're like i'm not sure you know and maybe we need to look at this outside of the context of an application that would be fine as well i just don't think we um probably would then apply it to this project um while you could do it at the final order stage now is really the time to be making those changes um you know so to me i think we would be looking for direction of now for this project or you know likely it wouldn't apply um we would just do that prospectively into the future on other projects cindy i i'm just concerned that maybe the it might be a surprise kind of a goal post change for the applicant that gives me pause okay so then we will just stick with the three year related to the wind because of the umatilla county code yes and then we'll look at it if we want to do it more broadly for other facilities we will look at that outside the context of i project all naughty heads here here harry are you okay with that yes i'm fine with it thank you thank you okay so we're going to move on so the next standard is the fish and wildlife standard and f6 fish and wildlife standard relies on the oregon department of fish and wildlife's habitat medication goals and the odfw rules define six categories of habitat in order to their in order of their value to wildlife the rules also establish mitigation goals and implementation standards for each habitat category under this standard the council must determine whether the applicant has done an appropriate site-specific studies to characterize fish and wildlife habitat at the site and nearby if impacts cannot be avoided the applicant must provide a habitat mitigation plan the plan must provide for adequate mitigation measures for each category of habitat affected by the proposed so in their analysis in the application applicant submitted evidence of a number of inventory surveys that they did for under this standard and they have identified both temporary and permanent impacts to the site what is in the dpo is an estimate based upon those surveys the conditions that we recommended for this standard require that they update those surveys to get a final number of a temporary and permanent the temporary impacts will be mitigated through the noxious weed and revegetation plan the permanent impacts will be mitigated through the habitat mitigation plan and the applicant has identified two suitable sites for a habitat mitigation area off-site as a result we have found that we agree that they have done adequate analysis for the dpo and the conditions that we recommended should take care of that so i don't know if there are any questions about what we did or how we came up with it but they'll do their true up before construction and the final numbers will be implemented so under threatened and endangered similar standard the council must seek to avoid harmful impacts to plant and animal species that are identified as threatened or endangered under state law the applicant must provide appropriate studies of the site to identify threatened or endangered species that could be affected by the proposed if the facility might adversely affect the state listed threatened or endangered wildlife species the applicant needs to consult with odfw or threaten an endangered plant species they consult with oregon department of under this standard if there is a potential risk to the survival or recovery of a threatened or endangered species the council must require the applicant to redesign or relocate the facility to avoid that risk or propose appropriate mitigation measures there were two tne species that were identified through the analysis conducted by the applicant we had mentioned earlier the washington ground squirrel and a plant that is known as lawrence's milk batch they're both protected species our primary condition under tna is to require that they conduct a pre-construction habitat survey on the final design we have also requests required and also the applicant has agreed to um avoiding all category one habitat so i think the true up will be on what is category one versus category two through six and um the commitment to avoid all category one what we have gone with for this one so if anyone has any questions about tna lauren's milk pitch nope okay so for the next standard is scenic resources yes sorry um we need to take a five-minute break please okay okay thank you we're going to take a five-minute break everyone thank you sarah thank you all right so for the record this is kathleen sloan i'm going to continue on the dpo for nolan hills we're on to the scenic resources the standard is intended to protect scenic resources and values that local land use plans or state federal or tribal land management plans identify as significant or important under this standard the council must evaluate whether the proposed facility would have an adverse impact on identified scenic resources if the proposed facility would affect the scenic resource and those impacts cannot be avoided council must require the applicant to implement appropriate mitigation to reduce those impacts let's see so the applicant evaluated the potential impacts from construction and operation to scenic resources identified as significant or important and out of that analysis they identified two scenic resources that the department has felt could have a visual the facility could potential visual impacts and so those two were more closely evaluated so the first site i've already mentioned it's the echo meadow site for the oregon national trail basically they proposed uec transmission line would be would be visible or partially visible from portions of that site however the blm has reviewed the information and has noted that the visual impacts would not be significant and that the methods used to evaluate it are consistent with their own the other resource would be the umatilla the rumatilla river is based upon distance over five miles from the views of the wind turbines and as a result would not those turbines would not prominently be featured in the view shed for these reasons the department has not identified a significant impact",

meetings that occur usually every month and in this case um uh two two Council meetings ago we proposed that we begin the contested case uh rulemaking and we laid out our kind of vision in terms of the scope and objectives and Council approve that so we kind of have our marching orders and I'll be discussing that shortly um so now we are in kind of phase two which is the uh development of the draft proposed rules and this is going to be the primary function of this rules advisory committee uh is coming up with a set of rules to present to council uh we don't always use Iraq but if the if the rule making is anything above kind of the relatively straightforward level uh we like to use Iraq to get feedback from uh um interested parties uh so once we have developed that draft of the proposed rules we'll enter the kind of formal rulemaking process it's called where we file with the secretary of state and notice the proposed rulemaking and that opens up opportunities for formal public comment period you know some people have several weeks to submit comments during that time we'll also have a hearing if people would prefer to do that verbally uh and then once that process is complete I will take those suggestions from the public the rack members if you feel like you didn't get a chance to get say your piece during the rack process you can submit additional comments during the public comment period um all of those comments will be in front of council without you know in their entirety so they'll have a chance if they desire to review them all and then staff will you know kind of do what we're paid to do which is kind of analyze those and make our suggestions to council okay so let's uh well I'm gonna go through the contested case process as well and then if anybody has any questions Jim I see your hand uh you you can uh we'll we'll get to him at that point so uh the contested case process sounds again like uh many of you have have gone through it uh I I just wanted to just just touch on a few tidbits here um not get into the weeds too much but uh just so we kind of all are on the same page about how the contest case process works essentially the rules for that process are found in oer 345 division 15 and then there's a little bit in 345 division one rule five which discusses incorporation of the Attorney General's model rules what we'll be discussing that in a little bit too but essentially it's it's 345 Vision 15 uh rules 12 through 85. so that's uh that's the contested case process in the rules um the issues for and they're mandatory the contested case process is mandatory for every site uh certificate um and it if nobody desires to contest the process then there's just kind of a formal closing out but we don't skip this step um the issues are limited to those raised on the record uh with uh within council's jurisdiction with sufficient specificity which is going to be a big issue uh I'm I'm guessing or uh and it and it's generally managed by an independent hearing officer appointed by Council to my knowledge we've never done it any other way but it doesn't it technically doesn't have to be um but that is how we generally proceed so another big issue is party status who's a party the applicant and the department are automatically parties to a contested case um but then the issue is who else can be a party and uh the rules as currently stated to find that as um any person who appeared in person or in writing at the at the draft proposed order public hearing uh that leads through uh kind of a very kind of legal process with evidence and and uh cross-examination and and you know uh information gathering uh testimony all that stuff ultimately leading to a final order by the hearing officer and the council can then um reject it and hold say if we didn't like anything of any outcome or any suggestion from hearing officer or they can approve it in whole or approve it with modifications which is essentially cancels prerogative with regard to everything they do uh if the council does approve the final order then the end result is the council must issue the site certificate uh once that proof uh the final order is approved or rejected then the application uh of the the application the process is then subject to judicial review which is kind of the last step so PL of final order goes directly to the Oregon Supreme Court so we get relatively Speedy resolution as far as these things are concerned there's it doesn't go beyond the Oregon Supreme uh and our staff's perspective is that the contested case process is designed or should be designed to create a clean record of review for the Supreme Court should any party wish to repeal the final order so the goal is to not drag this process out and if we do our job right during the contested case process it should be pretty easy for the Supreme Court to make a determination as to how things should go if we've done our job correctly so I kind of sped through that because we don't have a ton of time but uh Jim did you have a question about the about either the rulemaking process or obviously we're going to get into the Weeds on the contested case process so I suppose we should probably table that um I I just put it in into the chat the only thing that I was looking at is that on page two figure one of the overview of the permanent rulemaking process that you had sent out prior that flow chart is a little bit different than the one you just presented and it just seemed like um the public involvement sections were kind of left out and I just wanted to point out that they they were two different tables or figures and just wondering why uh I just kind of condensed it uh the process that I went over I mean it still has the same kind of public I mean it is the same process so if if my condensing lost some Fidelity of my apologies but um essentially the public can participate now uh in a limited sense through the uh these public meetings um but the main opportunity for public participation is intended to be uh during the uh consider once the notice of proposal making has been issued the rack is considered you know essentially members of the public too so uh the rack is also kind of the public portion it's just a more focused uh portion the design to go deep into kind of constituent concerns about uh whatever it is that we're trying to do does anybody else have any questions um thanks Tom yeah no worries Jim okay well let's move right along here uh so the scope is basically everything that talks about the contested case in division uh one which as I said before was the adoption of the Attorney General model rules and Division 15. where it discusses the um contested case process doesn't mean we're going to change everything uh or that we're going to radically change everything it's just the scope is potentially uh any aspect of the contestants process that we are allowed to change we this is the time this is the time to consider making that change so we're not we're not putting any boundaries on uh that at the moment the objectives of this rulemaking are kind of just primarily to make it more efficient uh and as part of doing that uh I I'm gonna table staffs you know ideas but one of the big ones that I that needs to be kind of let out of the bag now is that we do in uh strongly intend and we do want feedback on this but it is our it is our intent switch from the adoption of the Attorney General model rules to the office of administrative hearing rules uh which uh where it where it makes sense to do um and I will be sending out a chart that kind of goes over the a comparison between those two sets of rules and and hopefully once you get that document you'll see why we want to make that change but um the this rulemaking was going to be primarily focused on the other rules that aren't part of that incorporation um so just the rules that you see in division 15. so um and then as part of that process we're going to be we're going to be trying to identify in remedy areas where the existing rules have failed to provide sufficient Clarity to participants in the role making process and have become points of contention kind of not not for any real good reason other than that the rules aren't clear enough so we want to make sure that for uh whether you love the outcome or not uh hopefully we can all agree that that that the the rules aren't vague and and uh obscurus to the intent of of how the process should go and then uh just to be clear really the only thing that's outside the scope is everything outside division 15 and division one which is primarily division 27 where it talks about the contested case rules for the amendment process we have the amendment process rulemaking coming up very soon and so we were going to do anything that relates to the contested case process uh four of the amendment process we're going to be addressing at that time so um just makes it simple because in division 15 we're gonna it's it's up for gain did anybody have any questions I mean this is gonna the scope and objectives is going to be the whole the whole rack so I don't necessarily want to get two to the weeds here but does anybody have any questions any kind of high level questions about what this rack is is all right so it is oh we're we're ahead of schedule which is great uh so to keep this orderly I I basically what I want to do is sort of similar to uh the way we introduced ourselves is I want to just kind of go through I'm just going to call on you one at a time uh and if you don't have anything to share um that's fine um but I'm gonna be calling on each member of the rack to affirm that they don't have anything or if they",

        "text": "grid and community resilience center pilot grant program uh like i said we borrowed ideas from oregon in our petroleum planning and we're not shy we researched new york connecticut new jersey rhode island maryland massachusetts because people get all mad when we research california they're like that's not the same so we looked at these other folks and we designed a program memorandum next slide please where we outline the strategic objectives and i just want to point out you know the biggest thing was energy security and clean energy equity um these two us are are sort of the biggest issues because this is born out of this risk assessment from this atmosphere that we have in wisconsin where we're vulnerable to directions tornadoes flooding big blow downs that are harder to predict than hurricanes that you can typically see coming for quite some time but we're also we're really concerned with disadvantaged communities and how we can make sure that we're serving them appropriately when they don't have the upfront costs typically to invest in in so i'll go on to the next slide and we defined critical infrastructure your your definition in law is probably similar to ours is wide open what's a microgrid we told people what lifelines are next slide please and we borrowed from the new jersey board of public utilities uh these definitions for microgrids so that we could give tiered funding basically we also threw in the definition of a community resilience center because we found that initially i thought of community resilience centers as a single facility with battery backup and solar could be a hydrogen fuel cell could be any kind of backup um we put our memo out for public comment one of the big comments we got back is hey we want to be able to call a level one two or three microgreater community resilience center and we don't think that it should just be this this sort of level one definition so the public spoke we listened um and next slide please in the 15 uh awards that we made to these eligible applicants and it was and we really got everybody from tribal nations to uh the university of um to hospitals airports non-profits uh and we really you know previous speakers talked about targeting those partnerships and it's so so important nobody's doing this alone we really wanted everyone to work together on this and and we did find that we had great success with the sort of 15 folks that we that we awarded we've just gotten those next slide please we've just gotten those studies in and they will be loaded to our uh we've got an interactive story map on our website that i'll be sure to send a link to it's not quite updated with all of the all of the studies yet but um way up north the bad river band of lake superior chippewa they've actually been cut off by flooding before they've been an island in lake superior they already have three microgrids they did a feasibility study to see how to link those three microgrids because one of the electric co-ops that serves them uh has no room left on their circuits for more distributed energy so as we look at building out small-scale renewables we need to think about those types of things especially in a state like wisconsin where we don't actually plan directly with our utilities there is no integrated resource planning so we do a lot of policy by project like this but we're really excited to see things like the water treatment facility the wastewater treatment facility the mobile microgrid that we saw a feasibility study for that will bring up 5g and internet as well as three different facilities so a lot of exciting stuff i've got a few case studies um and i'm at my ten minutes so i don't really need to go through all of them um i would just say that it's it runs the gamut from urban to rural and um and i'm happy to take any questions but i know that we're running short on time so i i will just end it there great megan that was really really and insightful thanks for coming and sharing um do we have any buddy with any particular questions dave raised his hand dave go ahead thanks megan that was fabulous presentation i'm curious about the utilities roles in the microgrid feasibility studies design what how did they participate were they leaning in on this what can you help us whether they embraced this opportunity and and worked with customers locally help us give us that dimension if you would that's a great question dave thank you um we re we made a requirement that folks had to have a letter from their distribution utility in order to what we didn't expect was that a consortium of our municipal utilities was actually driving a bunch of the projects which i thought was great to see them not necessarily trying to own that we do have one investor-owned utility in the state that has a tariff for microgrids northern states power that operates as exile energy in wisconsin has a microgrids tariff where they own the equipment and it's sort of like on bill financing or microgrid as a service and and they have kind of uh pushing that they did the eau claire water treatment study but uh or participated in it so we definitely had good participation from utilities but they were not eligible applicants so it'll be really interesting to see with this 40101 d money that's coming out the grid resilience and reliability money that is a formula to states it it also says you can build microgrids for resilience and i don't know what oregon's getting but wisconsin's only getting about five million dollars that's not a lot to harden the grid just you know in the grand scheme of things so if we were to expand the microgrid program or try to implement microgrids with it utilities are kind of the lead there um i would probably be and and when our colleague from bonneville was talking really made me think about the co-ops we're also doing a low-income community solar program with the co-ops who who agreed to do virtual debt metering for these two specific arrays um and and they have expressed some interest in putting storage on those to see if we could get a more energy burden kind of reduction for folks if the community solar was more resilient but um just in general we've got a lot of positive feedback from municipal and cooperative utilities not so much engagement from the larger investor-owned utilities hopefully that's helpful and i just like to see a cow with a fart backpack on so i throw that on all my slides and you know we all like it megan we all like it i promise um great we have another question from orianna do we have time for this question kristy yes we do okay great i'm curious if you looked at other definitions of resilience like community stability or definitions that extend beyond just the emergency kind of reliability issues yeah that's a really good question um and more on the sort of bouncing back and shortening the period of time that uh folks in the community would be inconvenienced by a power outage we did and we left that very broad and part of that is because we're at the public service commission of wisconsin so anytime you sort of put a definition out it's gonna go through five or six hundred lawyers and uh a whole chain of command and it typically becomes a very i don't want to say inoffensive but an extremely broad and hard to argue with definition sort of like that critical infrastructure definition but i think we could do a better job and i think again as we look at the infrastructure act money we're going to have to come up with specific metrics to show what resilience means to us and to show why certain projects would be impactful because doe says you know we only want this grid resilience money to be invested in projects with the biggest impact what does that mean for a disadvantaged community i would say that that bad river project has a huge impact it's the difference between you know having the lights on and being able to run oxygen machines and being able to operate normally and not and you know possibly loss of i think you're right we should be more thoughtful about the way that we talk about resilience particularly when we talk about equity and resilience great thanks all right i think we got through our hands raised and um i don't see any other questions really great to hear ideas from other states this was a particular request from our state legislators to hear examples from other states and we really appreciate megan and wisconsin for making the time i'm from illinois which wisconsin people don't love illinois people but illinois people love wisconsin so it's really great to also hear from your home um all right so um we are ready to move on from this uh presentation section of the agenda um and if anyone has any other questions for our presenters feel free to put them in the chat or email me or stephanie and we'll get them and then share them with the whole group and thank you to all the presenters for those that are still on the line for being here yes thank you and somehow we are back on schedule so thank you to everybody for your help with that all right so next up we're going to show you um some preliminary results from the community renewable energy grant program i know a lot of you are interested to see how that has gone so far um applications for the first set of opportunity announcements totaling 12 million dollars were due on friday july 8th um and odo is thrilled to report excellent participation in this first round there were 68 applications submitted 34 of which were planning applications and 34 of which were construction applications and as you can see it was a good mix of resilience applications versus non-resilience applications um requested grants totaled around 27 million dollars with advanced requests of about 7 million renewable energy generation plan from all of these projects was around 30 and applications were received from all over the state from counties public libraries community colleges fire departments irrigation districts tribes cities water and sanitation districts consumer owned utilities public universities and state agencies odo is currently working on the eligibility and complete completeness review for all the submitted applications and after this is complete we will move into the competitive review um so are there any questions about that no i do have one question that says angela from oca it looks like the total requested definitely exceeds what's available um i think so yeah is there an opportunity for some of those applications to be funded but at a smaller amount or is it sort of a take the take it or leave it kind of thing",

        "text": " people can share maybe what I'm missing or feel free to elaborate on that list of topics um where you might be the more appropriate person to talk about it than I am if there's questions or anything that comes up so in the interest of making this Snappy we can go to the next slide and um uh we have uh like I mentioned we have our own bill that we're putting in and um it's essentially um a combination of some technical fixes to recent legislation with potentially some more substantive um pieces to it as well uh so um first of all one is very relevant to this particular group which is and may have already been talked about today in fact um probably was I'm sorry I I um take some time off on Friday so I couldn't be at the whole meeting today but um the natural and working lands reports we just don't think that we can meet the deadlines in the statute um due to getting Staffing hired and how long it takes to Do Contracting we don't want to you know produce a a product that's below the standards that you all expect from the Department of energy and what people also expect from the climate action commission and so um we're leaving in place the deadlines for the report related to the Natural and working lands fund that I'm sure you spent lots of time on earlier today but we will extend the deadlines for what I'm kind of calling the studies um and so uh those deadlines will all be extended by a year they're all a little bit different but essentially kind of fall right at the end of this com of this year and one Falls I think January 1 of next year something like that so we'll roll all of those over for a year and have all those studies to you all um or you'll be you'll be looking at them much sooner than that but they'll be released and final um about a year later so in the fall early winter of next year 2025 into that January 1st 2026 I suppose so um does anyone have questions on that did you all talk about it already and everybody's okay well we just it was just covered very briefly okay so if anyone has any questions on that feel free to ask um I'll look for raised hands I'll keep going unless I see anything um so so that's one piece of this this package um you may know or I think you've been briefed on the energy security plan that is currently um being developed by our uh nuclear safety and emergency preparedness Division and um there basically we had there's both Federal direction to complete this report and state Direction at the time the state Direction was provided we kind of took a guess at when we thought the federal money would come to fund that particular process and um a deadline that made sense with that in mind the federal funds were significantly uh longer to arrive than we expected and so and then the deadline for the federal report is later than the deadline in state law so we just want the state law deadline to match the federal deadline which would move it to September 30th instead of June of this year and then um we also have a a modest change to the community renewable energy grant program this is a program that's funded I think 59 projects in 25 counties over the last two years um and those projects are either smallscale renewable energy projects or small scale renewable energy projects with a resilience benefit to the community and there we prioritize both those resilience projects and environmental justice communities under this program um we're pretty proud of it we think it's a really great program um but we kind of found a little glitch as we've been starting to have projects get underway um we realized that while Our intention was that applicants their public bodies or tribes or consumer owned utilities uh we're often partnering with say a developer or a nonprofit the developer nonprofit was funding the project and then the idea is at the end of the projects when the Project's done we pay out the grant to the applicant and then the applicant can pass through that money to whoever's been paying the bills for the project we don't have a problem with that happening but the statute doesn't allow for that to happen so just a tweak to make that fit what we expected and what we we thought um thought would work work um so that's what's in the base bill um Senate 1525 I also just want to quickly flag that will um almost certainly be adding an amendment to um to deal with our community heat pump deployment program this program requires uh that the funds go to a regional administrator who then administers the program and pays for heat pump installations in those regions we have some regions and some tribes that are unserved and um actually there's a deadline today but I imagine we'll have I think a region at least and some tribes that are unserved and so we want to take the funds that are in that account and transfer them to our rental home heat pump program and then have them earmarked for those unserved regions so that we can get those monies out the door ourselves versus having them just sit on a shelf and never get spent in order to um pay for what can be life-saving um technology for folks FKS in certain areas of the state that would otherwise not have access so um I also just put in here there's uh a likelihood that there could also be some additional changes to the community renewable energy grant program we're working on those we've been hearing about them from others and and seeing what what will come of those but just wanted to flag that for those interested in that program um and more to come any questions on our technical fixed bill just full disclosure there I'm mostly meant to just make sure you knew about the piece that you all care about most of that first bullet but want to make sure it's always a chance to give transparency to what we're doing when I get to talk to you all um we can go on to the next slide then Christie oh I do see a hand yeah go ahead we can go to the next slide and talk about it if that works talk about whatever Senator denum wants to talk about this is Senator Brock Smith Oh Brock Smith I'm sorry I just saw Senator D and made an assumption oh no problem I know that uh when when you uh presented the coastal caucus last month or earlier this month I can't remember yeah um you spoke about part of my district not being within the program I've had some conversations good and um so I understand that you just said the deadline is today uh but I'm hoping that we can still uh find an active partner um and so I'd love to talk with you offline I've been meeing out but just been buried yeah Fair yeah I think we might have an application in for your for your region so I'll find it I'll find more out by the end of today but I'll reach out to you offline yeah can you shoot me an email and that'd be great absolutely good to see good to hear from you so um moving us on um other topics we expect in 2024 I know you've all been reading along and this is where I was hoping if there's people that you know they're running these particular pieces of legislation themselves might raise their hand and speak up if they know more about them um uh we know that the governor has a really clear top priority around housing production and that does include an incentive for climate friendly new homes um we know there's been a big workg group and lots of conversation around a bill that would allow um energy facility sighting Council uh jurisdiction for Standalone battery storage um we know that there's a bill out there that would on federal land where there's NEPA review um National Environmental Protection act review that would say that's the review there and FC would not also review on those projects um there's a concept around standby generators and energy um reliability uh there's I believe this is one I hear about from Kathy most of all there's a forest lands Workforce study bill that might be floating around there's a clean energy manufacturing concept um a floating offshore wind road map and labor standards for floating offshore wind projects um I don't know if Senator demro is on the line today or not but um Greenhouse G submissions goals are also something that was started out in the Oregon climate action commission Bill last session and came out kind of at the last minute and my understanding is he's working to bring those back and then uh that'd be pretty darn relevant to this group so stay tuned on that and then finally one I've just kind of heard about in The Ether a little bit but there's a bill that I it sounds like would require reports by utilities on um their progress toward forming or joining our regional transmission organization and with that I just want if there's other um commission members that know about other Concepts they want to share in this space or want to talk any more about anything I mentioned Now's the Time and otherwise I'm happy to hand things over and let you move on just a very quick mention um I've been in touch with Senator demro and the folks that are uh interested in advancing the forest land Workforce study uh to look at ways that we can make uh those two Workforce studies the one that's authorized out of uh house bill 349 and uh the interests that's uh more specific to Forest lands uh work together and complement one another so that that dialogue is is started and ongoing and um from what I have seen it that that bill could really add some depth and value to the workforce study um that we're doing and and vice versa other commission members want to weigh in with other Concepts that are being considered I don't see any hands up Amy you okay don't NE great no I don't see any other hands up at this time here just hoping it means that it's a nice quiet legislative session and there's no surprises all right you're such a Dre thank you thanks for having me today you bet thank you moving to next steps um uh just want to reinforce that um We are continuing to look for new Commissioners and uh director Benner dropped the link to the place where you can go and apply if you if you're interested in being considered for an appointment I think the it she dropped the link at about 1204 in the chat so uh you can find your way back to that and and um click on that link um we will be uh doing an orientation for new members uh as as one or more as folks uh on board uh as Amy shared we are",

into looking at what are some of the revenue options that are um possible for the city moving forward I've noted also in italics some of the work that is happening around the fiscal year 24 budget development process one important thing to note here is that that is fully outside the scope of the revenue task force but we obviously those are um thematically related to each other so those are noted here as well then in March we're moving into doing additional Community input we're going to have the community survey going out in March this is when we'll also be finishing up peer benchmarking and best practice research and that Community survey is really going to be focused on understanding and getting a representative sample from members of the community Community uh to understand uh Community priorities and inputs for this work that will not be an open Community survey rather that will be run so that it will be statistically significant and representative of the community more broadly we will also be holding task force meeting number three on March 18th when we'll be fully into deliberations with that group if you go to the next slide we have the last four months of this work work so in April this is when we will hold Town Hall meetings uh we have those on the 10th 16th and 23rd two of those will be in person one of those will be virtual to increase access and the goal of those Town Hall meetings is going to be able to provide another very broad moment for Community input and engagement we have some more targeted pieces in terms of obviously the work of the task force the focus groups and the community survey but we want to make sure that there's an opportunity for any any member of the Salem Community any Community stakeholders to be able to show up learn more about this process and most critically provide feedback and that's what will be taking place at those Town Hall meetings in addition we'll have task force meeting number four which again will be focused on deliberations meaning understanding there's a broad spectrum of Revenue options which might be the best ones to focus on for City of Salem in May that's when we're going to move into developing the task force developing their recommendations and so that task force meeting number five will be happening on May 21st and that's when this group will really start to wrestle with uh the question of what Revenue options do they wish to recommend and bring forward to City Council in June again that will be the primary focus we will have two task force meetings then on the 6th and the 26th to ensure that that group has sufficient time to um really deliberate and come to a good set of recommendations to bring forward one thing to note is that we do expect that the task force will have uh work between meetings we don't anticipate that all of the work will happen just in these meetings so there may be additional work outside of that that they will be participating in as well to ensure that they're well set up to U make the best use of that task force meeting time and then finally in July moving into August this is when the recommendations will come forward to city council we're having a dedicated session on July 15th on this topic and then we note that there will be a council meeting on the 22nd for additional conversation and obviously that can move um throughout the rest of July and into August but really that is when the work that will C culminate in terms of that task force recommendation will be brought forward council so that's the timeline update and I can keep moving into the next I think there's only one more slide before seeing if there's any questions so I did want to give an update on the task force selection process so we opened up the task force application uh in December and it was open through the beginning of January we received 157 applicants and thank you so much to everyone who filled out the application we so appreciate the engagement that we saw across the board really impressive slate of applicants that came in as part of this process each member of city council has been asked as you know to select two appointees and a potential alternative alternate rather for consideration at the board and commission's appointment committee that will be taking place tomorrow during that committee that group will select 20 to 30 members who will be broadly representative of the Salem Community that is the goal so that that committee will review the applicants and make a recommendation that recommendation will then be brought to City Council on January 22nd for appointments so that we'll be prepared for the January 30th meeting so it's pretty quick turnaround time we very much appreciate all of your support to move this work forward so that is the last piece I wanted to share apart from on the last slide there are some next steps that I've already referenced doing that task force appointment will happen on the 22nd then we hold the first task force meeting on the 30th then we really move into February into that focus group selection and the second task force meeting which will be on February 22nd and the next time you will hear from me generally will be at the next Council status update on February 26th all right are there any questions councelor Gwen I had a couple um the meeting tomorrow is that a public meeting that will be broadcast on YouTube and all of that yes I believe so and same question goes for task force meetings are those going to be public meetings broadcast for the public yes thank you that's it are there any additional questions councelor NC thank you I think my questions are along the same lines as counselor's Gwen's there is a lot of interest in the transparency of these meetings and what I'm hearing from you is in addition to the great points raised by councelor gwy that there are focus groups town halls and a community survey that are also up for discussion as part of this task force did I hear that right because that was a barrage of information all at once thank you so much for allowing me to clarify so the task force is the primary place where when we opened up applications for direct interest in addition so we'll be selecting members to to go there in addition to that we're going to be doing additional recruitment to select members for focus groups so those will be very small groups per Ward where we'll be getting um information back we want to make sure that those are representative groups so that will be a recruitment and selection process uh similarly the community survey will also be done in a statistically significant way which means that it will not be open to every member of the public rather it will be targeted to ensure that representation however the town halls are going to be the the other uh in-person event opportunities that that all members of the community will have to show up participate and provide feedback I anticipate that at those Town Halls we'll have ways of gathering input for members of the community whether that looks like a survey or just an open space where people can share their input so we will be designing some way of capturing that so that we can come back to both the task force and to council and really summarize here the themes that we heard through those Town Hall meetings in addition to that we as the Moss Adams team are always open throughout this process to hear additional input obviously from community members at any time but that the town halls will really be the formal way for any member of the community to come and provide feedback thank you are there any additional all right thank you very much thank you and now we're on to item 5B and I see Courtney Knox bush is approaching the podium on that one good evening mayor Hoy counselors um as noted my name is Courtney Knox Bush and I work in the city manager's office and I'm here tonight to give us an update you have a report in your materials called 5B and it is a draft of the policy agenda or the city council work plan for the coming year 2024 and so I'm just going to go through a couple and um to talk a little bit about what is ahead of us potentially so this is a follow-on conversation from a work session that you had in November I see some nodding yes um and uh so what I want to do tonight is just share with you some of the feedback we heard and how we incorporated that feedback into the 2024 policy agenda the draft before you tonight um the bulk of our conversation was focused around the progress that had occurred in 2023 on the priorities that were identified for last year and I'm going to show you um generally where we are again you see this often this is just a reflection of the B uh cycle that we do annually right now we're up in Winter where we're presenting to you a draft of your policy agenda and that work plan informs the budgeting steps that are to follow and then it feeds again we get community input around the fall time and we present that to you and then the cycle continues and continues so that's where we are right now this is a very awkward table excellent and so here is um the bulk of the feed back that we heard in November the first thing to notice is that you ask that we re uh order the four key priorities that shape your uh work plan for 2024 so you can see that we've done that here and then the next bullet about incorporating some new ideas in community engagement um you were speaking about overhauling the boards and commissions to remove barriers to participation you also mentioned that you'd like to see um an expanded sort of representation of Safety and Security um particularly because the work session in November followed a conversation about a community um violence reduction initiative and then in the Sheltering section of your priorities you asked um that we advance housing that is more affordable so you'll see that reflected you asked that we Infuse accountability and compassion in all of the strategies um and you also asked that we work to preserve services for the most vulnerable there was also a brief mention about um including housing options in the housing options including um protections for mobile homeowners and that's something",

        "text": " think it's important to evaluate that thank you thank you council member I'm and I'll just respond further that the um the new permit and the new plan will be spefic specific to the site and and more specific to the phase of construction and the layout that's specifically being moved forward with um and you'll see that there are is also some language that allows for uh the certificate holder to amend their plan and and that's just to address things like if there's micro sighting changes that occur or if um DEQ I guess or the department determines that or the certificate holder themselves find that bmps that were proposed aren't uh working as they were intended to work and I just said BMP is like five times that means best management practices and includes things like yeah uh um straw Waddles and and those sorts of things that you put on the site to control soil for moving well just uh real quick since you're moving to the left side um a quick question on the codes the standards for facility design does a recent Supreme Court decision affect any uh chair how thank you uh for that question um the comment we got was specific to and and I'll paraphrase and and my apologies if I'm not representing it entirely accurately that the record didn't include adequate information regarding things like ice loading or wind loads or um seismic criteria that would go into the structural design of the facility components themselves um and I'll just the way we view that is that the structural standard really requires the council to review us the geologic hazards at the site ensure that the facility can be constructed safely and in a manner that avoids hazards and avoids hazards to public health and safety particularly um but Building Code Compliance and actual structural Code Compliance is typically outside of the council's jurisdiction so that's why we didn't review that there um the Supreme Court decision related to setback requirements um was more of a a nuanced uh argument about what land use criteria apply and particularly setback criteria um we uh the for this facility when the council approved the original wheat rdge wind energy facility um the the certificate holder had represented that it would comply with those setback requirements so um conditions already require compliance uh and we do have um ver reification of that compliance built into the preconstruction compliance process um so the Supreme Court's decision uh doesn't have any substantive effect on the um draft proposed order there is a footnote kind of explaining the reasoning and why the setbacks were applied in this case um and uh and and why they weren't in Nolan Hills um we believe that based on the Supreme Court we can probably remove that footnote but um it's really we we appreciate any input the council has on on how do you like us to treat that any comments from okay um well I'll just say so it's it's on a record somewhere uh since that uh explanatory footnote is is really just explan explanatory and the reasoning uh was based on a pending Supreme Court decision that's now been made will probably remove It Strike it um and it we wouldn't consider that to be a material change to be PD thank you I see heads nting okay great um guess I was thinking differently um that it should not be removed because it is a matter of record at you know as um and I guess um I think that's important and temporal um it explains the thinking at the time for that project Nolan Hills is a different project and it was dealt separately so it might be six of one half dozen of the other but because it was in there one time I I'm I don't think I'd remove it but just a comment thank you v share Conan um I guess if the council is split on this or if uh these are just your individual preferences we can uh take everything into consideration and run this by your legal council and the secretary and see how we want to deal it that'll work works for me thank you um any other comments on on just the right hand side issues before I move on okay you can bring them up later if you want um I can't promise I will remember um if I could have the next please thank you um I'll start with the most exciting issue always to us uh um there as I mentioned um and this wasn't really on that slide but there uh was a request to extend the the deadline for completion of the construction in the rfa1 um in the DPO staff's analysis was that um because the facility was approved prior to the 2017 Amendment rules go into effect that the pre-2017 provisions that are still in the rule applied and that the council could only Grant a two-year extension um and we had written the DPO so that that two-year extension would apply to the entire facility with the changes in the proposed uh Amendment including the new areas um the certificate holder in their comments requested reconsideration um and asked for a three-year extension um for the whole facility we took another look at this we did consult with legal counsel on on what the most defensible interpretation of the rule language was uh and determine that to be most consistent with what's in the rules um that the council could Grant a three-year extension for the previous um we approved components because uh due to um the Wheat Ridge facility having begun construction prior to the subsequent divisions um these components are uh at uh I don't know in a regulatory sense considered to be under construction um and that we would establish new construction and commencement and completion deadlines for the newly components um and those would be three years from commencement needs to begin three years from the date of uh issuance and then three years after that date for completion um if you would like to go into the nuances or the fact pattern associated with this I'm happy to do that um but I don't know if that's the best use of the council's time um just matters where your interest lies everybody okay with that councelor found but I I might be confusing to issu so we'll have two time uh time um different time constraints on different components of the same project that is correct yeah there'll be two compliance deadlines yeah and you might have to refresh my memory on the 2017 so are there the uh 2017 rules um so are there amendments I know we limited amendments and so do the limitation does the limitation and amendments apply to the new components but not the old components or the yeah thank you Vice chair con I think I understand your question but um yes the limitation on the number of amendments that the council can grant uh the new rules allow two three-year uh extensions that would apply to both sets um this would be the first one for what was previously approved so the certificate holder would be eligible to request one more um for the new stuff they would still have uh two potential extensions of both deadlines I believe yeah thank you uh super clear and straightforward for that thank you for your question by CH all right um NY you can go ahead and skip my next slide uh it's all to get get really into the Weeds on this but we don't need to so that's great oh Tom can I have slide please and then the next slide after that one more thank you um great uh so getting into um the deadlines I'm going I Tred to organize these a little bit thematically but I am still going to address individual standards um as best I can um so really relevant to the soil protection standard a public comment are uh raised concerns that potential impacts on Wildfire on agricultural soils uh including the loss of organic matter in the soils and loss of permeability which can exasperate top soil loss and ER and um erosion were not adequately addressed in the DPO or or were not addressed in the DPO at all um we uh that was not an issue that was specifically addressed under the soil protection standard um uh whether or not it should have been um well I I mean I think we agree that it is an issue it's a potential Hazard to soils uh and that's something that can be considered under the soil production standard um we do looking at the Wildfire data um provided with the risk assessment um the the record really does indicate that Wildfire risk in the agricultural areas or risk of an uncontrolled fire occurring in the agricultural areas is low and lower than other parts of the site um part of that is an artifact of the way that data is prepared and I'll talk about that uh when we get to Wildfire more um but part of that is just the fact that agricultural lands are less susceptible to Wildfire than wildlands um we are recommending well we're not recommending an extensive review of you know the literature on what these hazards are um we are recommending that uh condition changes be made to require further revision of the Wildfire mitigation plan and the Emergency Management plan um to identify how while fire supression and containment strategies will be implemented at the site to protect a number of sensitive resources including agricultural lands um so we'll be looking for or what we're recommending is that um the council require more specifics on how um farmlands will be protected during a fire event um rather than focusing on um uh enumerating the hazard um I guess this is something to considered in in future orders uh as well so if you have any discussion or questions or comments please let me know Mr chairman yes um that sounds like U councelor delin yes Mr chairman just a short question for staff are we distinguishing wildfires on agricultural land from wildfires and grasslands in eastern Oregon uh being that there are grass are fairly common in EAS ggan uh council member Devin yes uh we are distinguishing in two ways uh one is that the fire risk data which is pulled from the community Wildfire protection plan tool uh which is itself based on uh quantitative fire risk modeling prepared by the US B service um is the current kind of publicly available um fire set that is most commonly relied on for local planning efforts and other fire planning efforts in the state and the way that that model treats agricultural lands uh it's crop stubble and fields are treated as particular fuel models and I can't remember which one off top of my head is uh shows up as unburnable one of them shows up as unburnable one of them shows up as low risk um in part because the fuel loading is different than what's on Wildfire lands um I think in eastern Oregon uh we we are aware and and the certificate holder should be aware that there's typically a 2",

        "text": "away thank you chair and thank you gu um a a a few things um you know one with the Equitable development strategy I just want to acknowledge that Washington County's diversity is overlooked um you know we are the most diverse County in our state and yet we don't have the advocacy groups the Affinity groups um you know in Washington County that you have in Moma County and and especially in Portland and um and I just want to make sure that as the Equitable strategy the Equitable development strategy is put together that you pay attention to Washington County um you know and again um you know we can give examples of how um you know of just the heavy use as you acknowledged um we can give you personal stories of that if that helps but I just want to make sure that um our diversity is acknowledged and taken into account um you know with the articulated buses um you know which could be a part of this um they need 60 feet and not 40 feet of like turnout or pull out and yet um we used to have articulated buses on TV Highway so do we really um so shouldn't our bus stops already be equipped to handle articulated buses without having to do some um I guess some additional modifications or changes um so I guess that that's one that's so there's a question another question is um you know with the railroad conflict with mass transit we know that happens throughout the country and so is there a way that trets Lobby can work you know with uh the the federal agency that also oversees the railroads because I know that the conflict with railroad rideway is not unique to TV Highway in Washington County um and then you know I guess one of the things you know there are times that we look at the density and I recognize the population density on 82nd is greater than you know uh line 57 in its totality um but when I consider the fact that many times our lowincome people are pushed farther and farther and farther out then that has to also be taken into account um you know the example of a a project from Beaverton Hillsboro could work but it not from Hillsboro to forest grow and I recognize that's just hypothetical but there is a reality in there that the folks who live farther out from Hillsboro are the ones that maybe need it more um you know or if it if they again if they don't meet the criteria um that's faulty criteria for the project because as as more and more people get push farther and farther out and they are dependent on mass transit then we are um creating it difficulties for them beyond what they already experienced so you all right thank you mayor Callaway for those comments um I think I think I have four things to address Kelly Tara hoop in I think that maybe you Tara can take the question about um interaction with Union Pacific um but I can start on that too so yes um incredible diversity in the TV Highway Corridor and in Washington County generally I didn't mention that as part of the equity Coalition that developed the Eds we had groups that represent some of that diversity in the corridor so apano was involved Central cultural um adalante mueres uh Muslim educational trust those were all members of our um Coalition that developed the Eds so it's really it really is um targeted and uh responsive to that diversity in the corridor um great question about the station design um a couple things we are uh investigating whether a 60 foot or a 40 foot bus is what would be implemented here trat is moving toward um a sort of agency-wide policy where when they are rebuilding um their station locations or stop locations they're they're plan on um a 60ft bus for any line in the system um just acknowledging that there is going to be a future of Greater ridership and that a 60-foot bus um could be necessary on any line in the system so that's that's really an agency policy that they're moving toward um the other reason that we would rebuild station locations is to move toward a near level boarding platform um which is another benefit of a project like this so that you have um the ability for people to get on and off the bus a lot more easily without a gap um between the curb and where they get on the bus um it's it's helpful for folks with Mobility devices shopping carts strollers um and it also helps speed the bus up so that you don't have to deploy that um ramp out quite as often um folks are are able to make that Quick Step Up I I don't know about how many of the pullouts today are designed for a 60ft bus but um this project would um be looking to probably reconstruct most of those that are already out there um railroad question Tara um do you have any thoughts on that I feel like this is a good question for you sure and thanks for fling that mayor Callaway um the as you know many of or there's some of our stops that are really just AB buding the right of way for the railroad and that addressing that need is a key component of the project as as we look at these stops and the access to those stops as well but in terms of conflicts with the railroad and how to resolve those that's uh there are certainly some programs at the federal level like the rail Crossing elimination grant program which I know I know we've looked at for um 185th um but we do work closely with the railroads and our lobby team um was the question if there's changes we need to make at the federal level to try to address this issue of the close proximity or um what was the specific issue that we you were hoping we could look into a bit more so not a specific change but just looking to see if there were things we could work on if there was federal funds available to help with that because I know there's a lot of cities that are working with the Federal Transportation I foret which department it is on rerouting the railroad tracks and the like but I see Jeff had his hand up but I think it's you know the question all the Mayors have is the railroads the biggest limitation on addition adding Lanes so how's this bus going to function without the addition of a lane only way you can do that is working with the railroad uh but there's quite a bit of movement with the last few years of railroad safety bubbling up about getting railroads outside within City Limits and also uh make sure they're above grade but Jeff you had your hand up yeah I think the specific on this one Tera that we run into is we have stops today that sit within the 60 foot RightWay of the track now if you ask me about it I think the challenge is pushing back on that 60 foot right away to to what Frank brought up is the safety concern this is not a high-speed Railway where if a train derails it's going to skid and slam and there's a bunch of potential energy built up you're talking about a train that operates at just above a pedestrian Pace in the RightWay and if it could get enough energy up to derail um it would be like watching a steamroller come at you I I think you might have a chance of walking away from it I don't want to underplay the safety issue but I I think that's our bigger challenge is how do we push back on that what feels arbitrary and capricious is to have a 60 foot right of way just because we say so when the more important thing here is is having a safe place for if we need a pull out from a 45 M hour highway to get the bus so it's safe and and doesn't create an an extensive impediment to the highway how do we justify that in that 60 foot RightWay and I think that's where it really crosses over to your help and and our ask from you is is how do we Challenge and push back on that because it's obviously the railway they've got 60 feet that they can move you know and they're I don't think they're going to move their rail anywhere in that 60 foot RightWay um how do how do we push back on that 60 foot requirement because it's just it seems arbitrary and capricious on this particular um area and a much more important thing is is a 45 mph way to get the bus out of a 45 mph rear entry Collision condition well certainly uh share that with our team and discuss with our federal Affairs team as well as you know the stops in the right of wi issue but the access to Transit is really a key um part of this project and what we've work in community but and that would be the the follow on right that would be the follow on right because it's not only is if we've got a stop that's pushed into the RightWay we're going to need to be able to also get curve gutter sidewalk that provides access in that in that may be an ongoing impediment to the 60 foot right away so how do we not get through the first one but also the follow on that makes it carry forward are there questions for Jess Jeff yes Jess do you think if I just start collecting bottles and cans along the highway and the bus way I'll get enough money to pay for this I I I mean that's that is really the big um if I say an elephant in the room it doesn't feel big enough maybe it's a blue whale Beed in the room is how the local portion would help pay into this because I mean we're talking about a right now $550 million project which 150 of it might come from the Feds that that's just um if you had noticed in the news we just tripled our fire Levy to be able to continue our fire service and do what we needed to do so I I don't know where there's another dollar of money for this particular activity so I I think we all know it's important and we need to address it especially on the safety and the and the customer side of it when they're just clamoring for covered bus shelters but I I just don't know where we the money comes from yeah thank you marene I think that is the key challenge of this project moving forward um our real goal is that this phase to design is significantly lower than $550 million but it's still going to have a significant local match um if we uh what you know",

update perfect and um you know sharing our intents with the project and we've shared our facility plan with them so they've had a chance to look it over and we've had some uh good productive discussion on that um now that they're actually seeing the amount of effort we've put into characterizing the site modeling um the contaminant transport um actually predicting what what are going to be those levels at the River and demonstrating you know that we meet the same as the background levels um has helped to build up our our level of comfort there so um that's going to be an ongoing process where we meet every two weeks um we let them see our our ongoing design status at this um shortly after we submit to DEQ so that they can see our project designed with full transparency good that's good progress thank you appreciate that Brian appreciate that too uh and then uh the Detroit septic system as in a planning joint Planning Commission meeting last night with the city council and um some comments were made about that is do we know how many businesses in Detroit have actually applied now for the septic system would you be aware of that and how that's going yes we out of the 54 eligible properties we received 17 Grant applications and we have our uh septic uh consultant engaged on all 17 now um we just sent out a certified mailing asking everybody to submit and we've followed that up with phone calls and emails using all the contacts we have we just want to get people in the program now so that we can start working on the design because uh the septic permitting depending on the complexity could take a while some can be faster um but it also helps those owners understand that in order to design this we want to help them make the decisions that they can so that the system we designed best serves their um future plans for their property okay comment was made that if they didn't apply by May 1st they would have to go through a reimbursement process is there any technical thing is there any significance about May 1st in that program May 1st is is the date that we asked everybody to get their applications in okay um that way you know it gives us about four months to go through the design proc the design imp pering process um but everybody still is going through a reimbursement process the grant is um regardless of when they apply that that that's the process for every Grant participant is that they'll be contracting out for the septic work and reimbursed okay good thank you Comm yeah thanks I think it might be a good idea for you all to send a letter to the Detroit city council with the steps that have been taken to it's really um while I think you're doing a superb job of trying to chase these business owners the city uh also needs to H have some ownership in their recovery and they're doing a good job with what they have access to but I know that not all of them are on the same page so if we can formalize a letter and just send it to the city they can review it on the record or however they choose uh and then also try to apply some pressure to their business owners I know they're anxious to recover downtown and it's difficult for you all to be successful at your job in this space if there are PE outliers not actively engaging in what this community septic will look like um and it could be more costly for us overall if they if they engage much later in the process than early in the process and frankly I would like to not waste money because they are delayed on whatever their issues are maybe they don't have the money up front and we need to figure out a way to help them secure those out- of pocket dollars you know to receive a reimbursement in the future who knows well 17 sounds like a positive number because yeah a couple people said well there's only been two and then Denny last night said oh no there's many more in in the pipeline so I think Denny but I think that's really good is to have some standard document that they all are on the same page because the discussion last night we it was um uh the board gave a grant through our Economic Development and we had the presentation last night um from the the Visionary was what the whatever that's called the visioning process the visioning process and they they kept talking about shortterm term uh Vision versus long-term vision and you know a couple of the one of the big things was the long-term Vision was when a sewer system came in and U we know that of course I made the comment about me being live when that first toilet flush is up there but uh interesting if they if they if they can get those septic systems in they can move I think with more long-term uh planning earlier so just to be clear we do have toilets in Detroit though flush today yes septic they do sometimes you step outside and you wonder what it where it went I don't actually think about that at all yeah Bri Brian if you'd like to come up and make comment please good morning I'm Brian Nicholas Maran County Public Works director I want to provide a little Clarity on how the reimbursement process works um on this grant program mostly because I don't want to well we're constantly fighting in and make are communicating to try to make sure we um we're putting uh we're resolving any uncertainty or questions that people have right so we want to we're it's kind of a battle against um uh bad information right so um let's see so for the uh for the commercial septic grant program um just the idiosyncrasies of arpa the funding source on this means that we need to give uh we need to Grant the funds to the property owner and they have to pay the the septic installer because we need them to qualify as a benit beneficiary not a subrecipient because the rules are different for the two so what we've done in our grant program is we've built it to where um you know they'll we will have a funding agreement a development agreement with the property owner between Maran County and the property owner um outlying uh the scope of work that's approved here's the budget that's approved all of that um their installer will get that as well so they'll understand um what budget we're working with Once their once their contract is executed with the property owner and we've we uh to ease that burden of out-of-pocket expense to the property owner we've just timed the payments so when they submit their invoice to us we pay them within two weeks and that gives them the cash to immediately pay their installer and we have um progress payments built into the agreement as well so if the uh if the installer needs a um uh you know Advanced payment for purchasing materials usually there's some sort of advanced payment that the installer needs mostly to purchase the equipment uh for install um that's built in so as soon as they order it we can pay them for that and the and the septic installer gets reimbursed so that's the strategy to make sure is that all outlined in writing so that that and maybe that's you put that in the letter well it's better um you know I'm actually thinking maybe we go to city council and that way we not just do a letter but actually go present at the next city council meeting so we can answer questions and make sure they get all the information that they need I think that's important for you to do but I also know that um um we have some lengthy processors on that city council who kind of mle things over I'd really like them to have something in writing because what I have seen in this kind of space of bad information is their their interpretation of whatever's been heard and it's in conflict with whatever commissioner Cameron saying or whatever I'm saying or whatever you're all are saying and maybe there's an FAQ frankly that we produce for them to navigate when they're in conversation with the community members and also each other I think they're to have some accountability in this program because there is some bad information and it's not because it's you it's not malicious it's just there's a lot to this program and a lot to that recovery and it kind of gets convoluted in the processes and I would like to try to help them be more successful than yeah maybe a a chart that that outlines the commercial properties that are eligible and here's the 17 that have applied I mean just that kind of information so they see it it's it and we all see it together so right um we can absolutely do that we've developed that uh information and presented a lot of it so we'll we'll put that into a nice fresh package this is complex for us who are dealing with it on a weekly basis and if so for folks who don't deal with this every day it's even more uh hard to hard to keep track of yeah they want to rebuild their downtown they're in a hurry to do it the community is pressuring them to do something and the technical details are uh difficult even for me who have sat in front of front of you multiple times listening to your presentations kind of to deliver so y um we have a draft uh agreement template that we've developed for this program so when um applicants first meet with us that's one of the first things we I mean we Orient them on how the process works",

building yes and so will it stay like that or are you going to have to pick up that floor and put it back down every time yeah so this is a portable floor and it's almost like a huge puzzle so when they will it will be stored excuse me stacked in pieces okay all numbered and then when they're ready for an event they will lay it out and we're trying to get the the process of install and removal sort of timed because it does take a little bit of time and their staff is getting used to that but I think we've got it down to about a day and a half at this point so for sure so is the floor owned by the Expo Center or by travel Salem I travel Salem yes do you just like continue to store it there and do they charge you for that they don't they don't charge us for that um and we're getting a credit for them so when we bring in events to use their space we'll get a credit towards refurbishing the floor so it's a wonderful partnership they've been really great like we do with our fair and our training okay yeah okay great so I'll keep you posted as we continue to hopefully bring in some really great events because of this flooring the last couple of things so we work a lot in the social media space we work a lot in the public relations space telling our story trying to bring real life characters and experiences to our consumers so we featured the Silverton Christmas Market in the Oregon garden we did places to capture stunning fall photos and that got a ton of traction as well there and then we did 16 dreamy Hot Springs you might visit and that was featured on MSN lifestyle a couple more just samples of what we did shampoo State Heritage area the beer here celebrate Oregon craft beer month and then Smith Creek Village offers cozy Forest lodging and that was featured in The Oregonian so I think that's all I got for you today and I'd be happy to answer any additional questions you might have great any any uh questions for Angie I don't think so so Angie did you share the pickleball tournament with us uh last time you were here did we hear about that and all all the stuff that happened with that yeah no we haven't reported out on that yet that will come in my last quarter report for you oh okay but I can just give you a quick blush um this was our third year doing it um the first year we had a little over 100 participants second year we had over 300 and this time we had 461 participants so we had to actually kind of Midstream adjust to two separate venues but our primary venue was illahee they have a premier pickleball court yeah it's beautiful and uh so we're trying to build the West Coast's largest pickleball tournament currently we are the largest indoor tournament in Oregon and so we're continuing to try to build that and bring Economic Development to the communities so thank you for asking so I know the uh sorry Mr chair please yeah keep going I know the um uh Detroit Lake Community Center is now restored and they haven't they haven't really got the I don't think we've got the agreement between the foundation and the city totally we don't have any hotels up there but our our staff is working really hard on getting septic systems in to get some hotel we have four hotel rooms I guess County staff yeah yeah yeah County staff is Public Works is working really hard to get sewer system or septic systems installed for uh the commercial uh down there it would be really interesting to keep that on the radar for um smaller like basketball or volleyball tournaments for the high schools and I know there's not a lot of places for them to stay but even if it was a regional like between Bend Bend in Salem and there was something that could be done there where they travel and even if it's for the day so in your Sports Marketing uh in the high school interaction there think about that because it's really beautiful now that it's been restored and could be used and helped them with some income as well as bring some attention to what's happening in the canyon with the rebuild going on it's wonderful yeah have you toured it have you seen it I haven't and actually I I'm going to need to get my staff out there to go take a look at it we should have that on the radar we should be able um you know pitch it yeah and you and on that trip we can help you with that on that trip when you do it you might want to stop in Mill City and see the new gym that that prayers yeah first put a lot of their products into there's a gym there as well so there could be yeah kind of a regional tournament in the canyon for for uh you know probably high school that'd be wonderful there's a gentleman in our community called Chris roach I don't know if you know who he is his dad's an old basketball guy coach and and Chris follows suit but he puts on the capital city classic um every December but he's somebody that I would try to bring into the loop on this because he's very well connected and he might know of some he might want to do something himself out there so let me investigate that but that's a great lead I appreciate it sure yeah thank you thank you thank you Mr chairman thank you for your time thank you Kelly

none of those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye commotion passes okay we have one item one item on under action today we're going to receive an appeal of the hearings officer's decision the nine conditional use permit case number 22-041 Silver Creek solar LLC and consider whether to schedule a public hearing for May 31st 2023. good morning good morning commissioners So today we're here to discuss accepting an appeal of the hearings officer decision denying conditional use permit cu-22-041 Silver Creek solar um so this was for the establishment of a photovatolic solar power generation facility on a 10 acre portion of a 30 acre parcel and a farm Timber Zone located at 3840 Silver Falls Drive Northeast just outside of Silverton on December 8th 2022 planning staff issued a recommendation of denial to the hearings officer on December 22nd 2002 a public hearing was held the record was left open until January 12 2013 and additional submissions were permitted through January 26 2023. on April 14 2023 the hearings officer issued a decision of denial the hearings officer determined that the proposal did not meet Marion County code as the Board of Commissioners repealed code sections regarding photovitalic solar on March in March of 2018 ordinance 1387. on April 28 2023 the applicant submitted an appeal to the board of county commissioner's office with a statement and appropriate filing fee the options uh for consideration for the appeal are to accept the appeal and remand the matter back to the hearings officer accept the appeal and schedule a public hearing the suggested date is May 31st 2023 to meet the state mandated decision or deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer decision denying the request and staff recommends the Board of Commissioners deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer's decision denying the request as there are no Provisions in the zoning code that will permit this sort of solar facility and I'll stand for any questions you guys may have any questions my only question is for the board because I was not here in 2018 and I've not decision but if you could provide context that'd be helpful sure Mr chair from me please uh so this goes back to the legislature in two thousand fifteen Maybe passed a bill that allowed solar farms in efu we didn't even know we didn't even know and all of a sudden our uh we had these solar Farms popping up in efu areas and they are uh put where uh PGE or whoever has uh infrastructure so and uh we we had a big hearing about it we had farmers in here and and um you know it's obviously a situation where some Farmers wanted them because they could make you know money on uh issuing their land the challenge was uh really high uh value Farmland was being taken up with these and I think and I'm going to speak for myself I I was the legislature won't let you build a house on 80 acres or less unless you can or whatever the number is unless you can produce so much income but yet we're going to start taking away farmland for renewable energy that um uh you know could be could be a problem so you weren't here yet were you okay so it was Janet and Sam uh yeah commissioner Carlson and and it was unanimous we had a big hearing about it uh and uh we we voted to because the the legislature allowed us to opt out of this okay so we said go put it in efu land on the east side where your trucks or whatever so basically we we stopped it from um back",

        "text": " of a bill to suggest the sunset yes and where was Washington County were we in support of that sunset or the the 20 cap yeah I see it the 2015 legislative session was an ongoing negotiation of what could and could not be lived with um I think at the end of the day Washington County wanted to maintain game chair as a program and therefore accepted the terms that the legislature proffered but it was in a very long and complicated negotiation so it's one of um places where I don't believe the County's position was particularly happy with this agreement but it was better than losing the program altogether yes this chart is fairly old it actually um is one that Greg found from prior to the 2015 cap and sun setting and it's really hard to read so but the key takeaways here is what we were expecting as local governments out of Sip and gain share was that that red line is the property tax that's abated so our revenue losses and then the green bar chart above shows what we were expecting to gain through the game share program over time and you'll see that it was you know expected to go up and up and up and just shy the estimations at the time were by 2020 fiscal year we would be getting just shy of 50 million dollars but something happened on the way to 2020 called um cap and that hit us at 16 million dollars and really set us um to have a really different relationship a fixed cap a fixed cap and that is a but the red line continued the red line continued because the property tax abatements continued because everything had been negotiated expecting danger to continue down the path that it had been um the other key thing that changed which actually doesn't matter as much because of the cap that was put into is that they changed the calculation to not include retained jobs because the political conversation at the time was that it was really hard to measure that and therefore seemed suspicious to some people if you Google the headlines from the day the word boondoggle comes up a lot I don't think that that's a fair assessment of just the level of investment that we have brought into the state through our sip Investments and that gain share it really is just a drop in the bucket of what we provide back to the state so 2015 included the sunset the cap and removed retained retained jobs yes I was my next slide so just to be a little bit clearer here in 2015 as the chair just summarized um that Senate Bill 129 really did modify game share um to cap the payments at a 16 million dollars which is not indexed it is not Revisited at any point in time there's no plan for revisiting that in um at in 2015 it also limited the payments to new jobs that are tied to a Civ project as opposed to trying to calculate what is actually retained as a result of Investments and it established it established that 2024 sunset for the gain share program and then in 2022 we worked for a six-year extension but ended up with a one-year extension because politics are complicated in short sessions and Aaron it says cap payment to any County at 16 million but that doesn't mean that Washington County gets 16 million the a jersey geography of Washington County gets to get a million dollars and we are going to talk about how that is so this is important we really need to include the word geography okay yeah I agree because it looks like the county gets that so because our rural colleagues for Rural sips there's a 10 million dollar cap I there's some there's or maybe it's the 10-year cap there's there's different Caps or terms that's the word I meant to use for Rural sips they think we're rolling in the compared to them and they are really enjoying their rural steps um so um and so we're having to tell the story to our AOC colleagues and this is beyond the lit this is to every steering committee which is all County Commissioners then the ledge committee and the board that we're not seeing 16 fixed 16 million and and um it hurts I think because Genentech was a rural sip there's also controversy over that that piece I I think that that's died down but yeah but I don't think our rural colleagues I think the Royal colleagues still remember that so as an unfair utilization of a royal sip oh okay yeah yeah got it I have a question about historical knowledge uh the point here it says capped payment to any County it's a stimulant then you mentioned geography how do we we're defining County versus geography do you think so it's not 16 million dollars that comes to our general fund it's 16 million dollars that we've distribute which is the district to the taxi everyone in the county everyone that would have received the property taxes related to that project to the chairs we'll get to that distribution to the chair's comment there you're saying there's counties that actually get just certain amounts just for the county not to share with the everyone in the county how other Counties have managed their rural set payments in the Sip and the gain share payments they've received back is I think up to each County how they distributed we could keep it all right we negotiate it with the taxing districts that are impacted so that's why I use the word County there is because it is a county who is we'll get to in three more slides from the legislative history we're going to look at what that has done to the budget well it's a perfect intro so on the next slide this is a graphic that we shared we shared with you a couple of years ago as well but what I like about this is you can see the first three those represent the Sanibel 129 I think that's right 7.29 prior to FY or the gain share program prior to the cap so this was the amount that was coming to Washington County the organization not Washington County the geographical so this is the net amount that we were receiving from those green bars that were projected in the earlier grass this is the county county specific as an the 2016 cap you'll notice here was it 9765 and FY 16 and basically continues at about nine seven it drops down to nine two nine two all of these lines in green are actuals and this was through fy21 so in FY 22 and Beyond we had just projected at 9.2 million the actual FY 23 number that came in is about 1 9.1 million and I'll explain why it's declining here in a moment the bound yeah the balance of the 16 million goes elsewhere which I'll show you in a minute as well I just wanted to ask a question before you move on from this go ahead is there any way we can see historical documents of FY 2014 2015 what the investment of those dollars were yeah we have those in fact I'm going to show you a high level of it but we can also share some detail later if you'd like okay so uh next slide is how this is getting to the question about how do we actually distribute the gain share funds and not to oversimplify but it's largely distributed the same in the same method the same way as the community service fees underneath the Sip agreements and that's essentially by tax code where these invest where those Investments are made those tax codes are the ones that are used those overlapping taxing districts and how those dollars are distributed so it's the same as it's used the same as the Sip and those that currently affect the gains Fair distribution are the three that you see up on the screen now the 2005 2014 sip with Intel and genotech the 2006. okay so again this is a graphic that's been shared with you before right can I you talked earlier that the 2005 set was activated in 2010 goes till 2025 but has hit the cap in 2017. so why are we still the Sip distribution with regard to that since it's essentially run its course and instead follow what's already activated with the 2014. the 2005 was activated in 2010 which means it runs through 2025 right the cap refers to the amount of investment they hit there 25 so the way my understanding and I will look to Tom and he can correct me when I get anything wrong um is that the way we negotiated the Sip agreements is that the terms of 2005 stay in place until it runs its 2025 course yep so that the 2014 terms the 2014 sip terms do not come into play for purposes of payments to the county or distribution agreements that were reached in the 2014 sip until that 2020 or 20 2005 sip agreement actually closes in 2020 yeah in five thank you thank you okay so this slide is one that's was shared with you a couple years ago and the numbers the specific numbers that you'll see up here aren't as important as the distribution of numbers so this was the FY 21 actual distribution of the 16 million dollars collected under gain share and you'll see that the county of Washington the organization was about 9.2 million and then the distribution of the rest so the difference between fy21 and fy23 is a couple of key components I just want to let you know is that all of the I believe all of the other taxing districts certainly for the county of Washington have slightly declined so Washington County has gone from 9.2 to about 9.1 million but the urban renewal IS 268 000 that has actually grown to 472 000 which you would expect under an urban renewal District to grow that's why they're there education that's yes yeah uh game share accrues to the local government bucket of property tax collectors because the income taxes that are raised pursuant to any sip agreement backfill the state's general fund which then gets pushed into the education budget which is how they've traditionally backfilled any property tax abatement program and so when we increase the income tax revenue to the state by over a billion dollars that's the that's the bucket that the education is backfilled through and in addition in during that 2015 negotiation while it wasn't included in the bill there were other conversations about making explicit increases in continuing service levels related to education trainings um see the um for trades and other",

this um programmatic agreement hopefully has gotten the attention of somebody in Washington DC because they are going to review it um the other thing I wanted to comment on real quickly is um the um anyway I could go on and on with cultural surveys there are problems with not giving specific details about what mitigation is going to be on and on and on um I went through the changes in the site certificates uh when they change from the site boundary to the micro sighting Corridor obviously that's a big deal um they're not requiring mitigation for ADN fatalities that are not within the site boundry they are uh they changed the historic Properties Management plan to rely on the the federal one um they are not notifying ODFW if um there changes to the fish passage that occur within the site boundary now they're only looking at the microing area so there are no indirect impacts being reported um they're not requiring subsurface soil and geological conditions beyond the micro sliding area the rule specifically says that they're supposed to look beyond that um sighting area into the the area surrounding it um are see I went on and on Wildlife surveys are being limited beyond what the rules say which I think it's a half mile for Habitat they're supposed to look at they're not going to do that it's half a mile beyond the site boundary they're now looking at just the sighting Corridor um let's see they're not doing preconstruction traffic studies on Sage grous so they have nothing to compare with when they decide if their traffic impacts to Sage grous um they remove the preconstruction requirements for surveys of bats I did do a written report on this because bats are nocturnal and if you're thinking that they're going to identify bats by just wandering through um during the day it's hey Miss Gilbert gonna have to catch you on and I could continue but uh obviously there are a lot of problems with the changes I hope you really pay attention Okay thank you for your testimony uh we have um anyone else in the audience uh present to give public comment tonight this item okay and Nancy could you check uh the phone and the webinar good evening can you yes uh we hear you could you uh state your name and address uh yes um and there'll be two people uh speaking from this um recording my name is Fuji krier Fuji k r 60366 Marvin Road LR Oregon tonight I am here representing the stop B2 Coalition which is a nonprofit public interest organization with over a thousand individual members and eight organizational members representing thousands of additional individuals I'm sorry I'm getting feedback did you have a question no it sounds okay at this end okay okay sorry thank you um I think I first I better interject that I will concur with Irene Gilbert um that her comments that our written comments officially stop B2 Coalition which were sent to Kellen uh earlier um should have been included in Irene Gilbert's written testimony as well uh she is the Stop's co-chair I'll just put that in there that we concur with her testimony earlier um our comments are in writing with I hope specific specificity enough to reach your bar uh tonight I'll just comment at a little bit of a high level given the interest of time I just want to say first that Idaho powers latest Amendment rendition request for Amendment two is a wolf in sheep's clothing an expansion of a site boundary from 24,000 acres to 96,000 Acres a 300% increase is striking stop completely objects to the whole premise of this land grab schema created by Idaho Power it is filled with terminology obfiction without Legal Foundation the company is trying to strategically position themselves even gaming the fsac rules on amendments to either cut corners or violate land owners and the public to process rights to the Future by using ADR or administrative determination requests something like that ADR process which are a shortcut process in the future the company is also gaming the public and public officials by not providing adequate maps from which the person could meaningfully participate and for land owners to even understand what's happening on their land all of this toask the fact that the request is a massive is it's just massive and stop believes that this intent is really to speed up sensitive negotiations with land owners in order to corners and cut the land owners out of the process stop urges coun to either deny rfa2 or remand rfa2 back to Idaho Power to complete their landowner negotiations and engineering design changes adopt the stop B2 recommendations of conditions here in other in the writing which we believe will be more protective of the land owners in the public and to allow Idaho Power to return with more real realistic Amendment requests that are specific to changes in Parcels or facilities that are inside or outside the already approved micro sighting Corridor as was done in rfa1 while using the type A amendment process that demonstrates compliance with all of the FSX rules and standards that's our request and I have one more and I guess it's a formal request on the record here tonight that there may be an extension for even a few days if not a week for the people who have not been able to fully put their writing uh to you um and for example Mr Myers who just uh testified um if he could send you the rest of his stuff tomorrow we would request an extension past this hearing this evening thank you thank you Miss krider was there Mr krider yes there certainly is okay and could yeah state your name and address please sure uh 60366 Marvin Road LR Oregon and today I'm speaking just as me not as stop B2 um because don't want to take more time since the organization got their five minutes but I kind of want to speak kind of more openly and and first I'd like to apologize to the staff because at your last meeting I stated that the staff had all the kmz maps that Idaho Power had in the map sets and I was incorrect and I'm I apologize for speaking out of turn there because that is one of the issues that you'll see is significantly brought up in our filing is that the maps are not capable as currently presented to give land owners adequate information to make informed decisions about the impacts of this transmission line on their land and I go into some detail showing you screenshots of what's available doing comparisons and give you a quiz to find a certain preserve and put it together in its whole so that the maps have some issues there are solutions so I I I hope that you'll listen to us there um I also feel that our processes now have a rush to build and I know the agency is under pressure to improve and speed up the sighting process uh there was earlier mention of other agencies becoming more efficient to FSX requests and that is because of your work to get them funded to have people in those positions to do the work that's required by law the problem is we came in before those people were in their positions so kind of some things that should have been done didn't get done and we talk about that and threatened and endangered species um I would also land owners are not nimes um they're conservationists the people the land owners that are pushing back truly care one of the land owners I'm working with um he's choosing you know he's he's offering to move the line away from Morgan Lake Park so that individuals are not impacted and certain cultural um artifacts are not Disturbed he's taken a hit on his land putting it in the middle of it to preserve something he's a meanwhile another neighbor that um I had worked with um worked with Idaho Power proposed an alternative route within the new site boundary Idaho Power came out had the laptop walked GIS mapped the area sent back Maps saying okay how's this look and then last Thursday they called this landowner Idaho Power in-house attorney and said hey I need an offer by tomorrow and by tomorrow I need to know what discount you are willing to offer me on the rate we will pay you for the easement and it was not a percentage it was a fixed value and the assessments for the land had not been done yet and I have some more information on that but Idaho Power sent to these neighbors these land owners two weeks prior a good neighbor letter explaining how this process was good for them and that they should support it meanwhile this is what they're doing and Idaho Power is telling you oh the landowners want this have any of you asked for any names any numbers is it one land owner or is it 10 land owners we don't know when I have asked Idaho Power for this information it is privileged information between the company and the land owner boom door closes so I also know that this is outside of your jurisdiction that's what we've been told from talking to staff when we talk about Idaho Power there fancy footwork they're bullying but with what they're doing is the people are just what what you're doing by saying this is none of your responsibility you're leaving the people to hang out to drive and let a corporation blackmail them and my suggestion to you is if you want to represented citizens of the state that you will deny this request and that you will vote in favor of a process that is involving the public from the GetGo you guys do a good job but I think there is a better way to do it thank you very much thank you Mr crer okay um Nancy that is there anybody else on the web X so uh Wendy King you have your hand raised I'm going to go ahead and unmute your mic Wendy you're ready to make a comment Miss King the Myers family I live at 1337 Southwest pmus Avenue Apartment 303 Redmond Oregon 9775 there are a number of",

        "text": " want you to let Diane and Mark know that I applaud Clean Water Services focus on that collaboration and certainly improving those relationships not only with the city of Hillsboro but I'm assuming you know that's going to be with all the cities in Washington County so congratulations and good job on that appreciate that yeah these are the the statistics you showed for Hillsboro are pretty amazing I knew that obviously that the population had significantly increased the way you demonstrated there I just didn't put a 55 number to it it's pretty amazing for that and you certainly upgraded your mayor you know that there was some problems before but yeah but yeah no congratulations on this we look forward to continuing this very positive relationship thank you I just appreciate the information I appreciate the fact that uh both parties have come to the table in such a collaborative Manner and hats off to you Joe for for your work in this as well I think the creation of the kind of a new approach by thing mother Services was at the right time so thank you thank you commissioner trees I just have a uh the Allison Craig presentation and thank you everyone for being here the October presentation the city of Hillsborough presents the IGA to the city council here also is that when our board expects this idea to be to I think we will come after we're done at the city the city approved IGA from the city of Hillsboro Council that we would then bring to you so you would be second and then in the event the Board of Commissioners have changes how does that work does it go back to the city council again then I would think I don't anticipate I don't anticipate way of changes but just wanted to depending on those changes we would probably have to go back to the city of Hillsborough so and I also anticipate you seeing the the final document earlier than before okay it's been acting on it so if there's anything that jumps out there's so many eyes on this from different perspectives and I've always said the dividends for this process is going to play out over the future we're going to have an updated agreement which is great because our current agreement is you know outdated was written at a different time and place it's more about the relationships that we've built I really feel when there's an issue that comes up because there's always issues in the City of Hillsboro OR or next month you'll hear from Beaverton that we know each other now and we have a better sense of each other's roles and we trust each other and we'll tackle those together so instead of two different organizations we really are working more as as an extension of each other that's the real dividend that I see from this this effort over the last couple years and the benefit beneficiaries are there are all of our residents in Washington County yeah because when there's a problem and you've never worked with the counterpart from another organization and your first discussion is to address a problem but I don't know who Raheem is I had no basis to know what he does or what's important to him that's a little tougher now we know each other and there's a level of trust and we're working on a variety of things we know what their priorities are and how we as clean water services kind of fit into that puzzle and how we can be a partner and help them achieve their Community goals that's really the dividend that I see that's going to play out over the rather than a document oh we have a problem let's pull out you know paragraph 10 what are the rules so yeah maybe maybe perhaps this I don't know if this slide could be so that people know when this IGA is coming to the Board of Commissioners could be updated just so that um people who go to the side and don't want to listen to the video they can just see it but just that's super minor and Allison I can relate to the growth changes that you talked about especially the South Hillsborough I live in Aloha and I see I especially Reeds Crossing how it's blooming and I remember being that like empty lots with a whole bunch of birds that we used to see and um and now they're houses and just Kudos is developers out there in Washington County how you know I know our board engages conversation around the permitting process and and how long that takes but then I see Reeds Crossing and how it's you know there's no housing and then there's houses now so it's just just amazing and as well as the North Hillsboro side but I definitely see and live and breathe on the south Hillsboro development congratulations to the City of Hillsboro Raheem to your leadership and to Robbins and and the upgrade of Mayor that former mayor Willie now commissioner Willie mentioned but I as I opened that and a lighter question were you there with city of Hillsborough when commissioner Willie was mayor sadly no I've been with the city for the about four and a half years okay I think maybe it's sad this is a sign of like the cities growth Allison's position didn't exist a couple years ago her position is new as the division main as the division manager over the storm and sanitary division just going to our growth and our staffing has to grow as well and um candidly without Allison here we wouldn't be at this point having this conversation so it's also prayer leadership too congratulations thank you I was going to count the number of times you said collaborative it was a lot and so um hopefully in the future that that we don't even have to discuss that that's just a given it's a standard of doing but um what I've I know Joe knows this and I can't mentioned this before but my my dream is that you become a customer for all of the area within your not only your UAA you know the your Urban growth boundary agreement but also in any growth areas and it's uh we would have one bill to you every month and you would handle all permitting all of all of the issues within that area so that truly you're a customer of what was intended when the whole organization clean water performed and that's a organization that does what and treats and transmits to the plants and later it became storm water we don't have to be in the retail business as I call it and maybe we shouldn't it's always better when I was a mayor many years ago and that was always a rub I mean we didn't need clean water in our areas Even in our expansion areas so I I guess and my dream if I want to say that would be that we look a little more holistically a little more futuristically in saying you're not defined by your boundaries today you're depending on what your boundaries and aspirations are can we come to some kind of a understanding or agreement that maybe you they're your customers not ours and maybe you do the permitting instead of us and we still have to take your phone so we don't want you dumping motor oil but we have to have that collaboration to make certain that everything is you know cleaned up before it hits our plans because it's very expensive if you don't I think there's a a different look we need to have that we keep looking boundaries as today and I think we're going to look at batteries and what you want if you don't want those boundaries then they shouldn't be in your growth area agreements they shouldn't be in your early growth boundary expansions we should say all of that is yours how does that become yours in our vernacular and how do we send you one bill you Bill them all and obviously there'd be some conversation for that but then there's also some way for you to take and permit so that you're not they're not coming to us and so if I'm way out that's okay because I tend to look out a little bit further and I had a conversation about this very topic yesterday with some new guy over there in Hillsboro Steve Callaway or something like that but anyway Steve and I were chatting we're at another meeting uh from The Gorge together and I said could you expand to that point he said very interestingly I think we're there so I hope that you get and I I know it's too soon for this one but maybe not I mean maybe you ought to take your blinders off and look at something a little bit more expensive so I'll stop with that no thank you that's I think that's pretty much in line with what we're looking at um in fact I think you'll see the spirit of that in some of the new changes that we're making making in the um taking on some more permitting responsibility and would you mind before we leave because I I mean some of you have worked with a long time so if not but I'll start with somebody I did Bob just introduce yourself so everybody in for the record I don't did we do that earlier I remember catching everybody's interesting yeah I don't know if we did that but we certainly can my name is Bob Baumgartner I am the director for Regulatory Affairs at Clean Water Services that'll turn it over to Jamie Jamie Hughes I'm a program manager also in Regulatory Affairs Water Services and I am Allison brixing the division manager of our storm and sanitary sewer program and I'm Raheem harji I'm the deputy city manager here with City Hillsborough thank you just for the record and we all know who was here anything else that the board has thank if not thank you very much so much thank you thank you is there anything else we want to chat about today anything coming before us anybody has anything any last bites take the rest of the day off okay what are you doing what you got to do yeah all right I think you're supposed to provide some",

        "text": " so I think there's a real benefit to the region or Industries to have this sustainable shouldn't be that hard sustainable supply chain available to them because they their demand is there um they want to reduce their carbon footprint um they want to be able to show that and so this is a benefit to them to being able to have this resource any questions on this one I have one I don't want to get into the detail but you've been talking about this for 20 years because I've talked to you about it before yeah uh on the uh finite resource that's a little misleading it is finite and that uh you only have so much capacity to produce how much I mean you can't you couldn't supply all of the metro area for instance oh absolutely not no what are what are you saying when it's not it is not a finite I think what what we're saying is if you unlike producing something in the earth there's only so much in the Earth's crust if we could take it all um there there's an there is there's no limit on how much we we can't realistically produce it all but we're Reus using versus extracting new so it's kind of a recycling you're not talking about your supply okay yeah yeah that's all right yeah okay Bruce so um when we investigated this one of the things we wanted to make sure we did before we went too far is is is look at business models and what seemed what would make sense for us for an RNG project usually at our treatment plants when we build improvements the business model is it's all on us right we we design it we build it we operate and maintain it we pay for it Etc in this case uh we decided that what we wanted to do was have a business model where we serve up the gas the biog gas and the partner that we uh bring into the project does everything else they are responsible for treating the gas they're responsible for injecting it into the natural gas pipeline uh selling the gas if if they aren't going to use it themselves Etc and so uh we went with that approach because in well in part it was because we um didn't have the expertise uh that it takes uh to do this both in terms of uh you know uh cleaning up the gas to a level that the pipeline can accept we also didn't know the gas market we didn't understand you know what it takes to play in that and to deal with the environmental credits that uh you create when you when you have renewable natural gas there's there's quite a paper trail for those credits there's a lot of things you have to do in order to to prove them are you saying that the partnership goes back to the uh bottom line to the biograss membrane treatment as well yes okay I think that so so everything from the treatment system into the pipeline is respons they're responsible got it thank you sure so just getting into this a little further with the U the the uh business model that we selected and comparing it how to how we normally do things uh you see the CWS design build operate that's what we normally do which I just described the public private partnership involves bringing in a private partner um economics uh speaking of Economics um you know we wanted a situation where uh we weren't having to be at the mercy of the market we wanted a partner who could buy the gas from us pay us a fixed price for it with inflation adjustments if we're going to do a long-term Arrangement and not be a in a situation where you know we don't know what the future looks like and so forth so we we were we were risk averse in that sense um we also in terms of our role uh wanted to just serve up the gas and be done with it um if we were involved in in every step of the way approach uh we'd have to find buyers of the gas we would also have to make sure the gas meets the very stringent pipeline standard that Northwest Natural has for for bringing gas into their pipeline system and of course we'd also be responsible for Designing and and and and instructing and and being responsible for o andm and so forth on the system so um and then when you look at flexibility which is basically you know how much room do we have to change course if future conditions change since this is this is likely to be a long-term Arrangement um you know we wanted a situation where uh if things came up that required improvements or more money spent we could at least cost share with a partner on instead of having to be responsible for all of it uh we would also want to make sure that we had a right of first refusal in case someone came in and wanted to buy the system from our partner and we also wanted to have certain termination rights um and you know those are important but if you look at it from the partner standpoint they're investing 10 12 million in this project they don't want us to run uh and uh you know be left high and dry so this is something that requires some some negotiation um if we were to do the project ourselves of course we'd have complete freedom to stop it abandon it do whatever we want uh but also be assuming a lot more risk and so uh we didn't want to do that and and that's basically in a nutshell why we chose the business model that we did one of the things we were concerned about as we looked into RNG further was is this realistic I mean can Society potentially produce enough of this stuff to actually um displace a lot of natural gas in in the nation's pipeline system so uh we did a little research and we found a couple of reports uh the first first one was actually that's not a DEQ report it's an Oregon Department of energy report from 2018 that basically said there's enough potential sources in Oregon to supply all of the residential customers for gas in Oregon um I think it's important to point out that uh wastewater treatment plants are one source of this gas but we also have landfills uh there are other Technologies besides digestors uh which are I don't think quite ready for prime time but uh lots of research is being to use things like Forest waste and agricultural waste and so forth really anything that's organic could be fair game to turn into renewable natural gas um looking at Northwest natural's website they believe that uh combination of RNG and hydrogen and efficiency uh gains could make the gas Network completely carbon neutral they are doing work on hydrogen uh right now they have some Test Facilities for that uh there's a a certain amount of pipeline space that you could allocate to hydrogen um not a lot but it would help uh in mixing it with RNG to uh to displace uh fossil natural gas currently in the in the United States there are 757 RNG projects uh up and running uh and in 2017 there were only 50 so a lot of progress has been made of course a lot more needs to be uh made as well what those projects are they all putting the RNG into uh gas pipeline for communities or are some of them just within like industry direct pipe location to another industry that's a good question and I don't know the answer um well I think that level of growth yeah is is significant in that time frame um but I I wanted to see a probe uh to see if a majority of them might be with gas companies getting that product and recycling the natural the RNG right uh or as as I understand it RNG allows Northwest Natural to take advantage of additional capacity in their existing pipeline that they currently can't utilize so it's really a double whim if I'm I am correct in understanding okay thank you yeah appreciate it and I I think one thing that's being done with a lot of this gas is it goes directly into tanks and it's used to fuel vehicles so it's not going to be in the pipeline in that sense yeah okay all right thank you yeah so uh we issued an RFP and uh we chose Northwest Natural to be our our private partner uh there are several reasons why we think they make a good one first of all you know they're a longstanding stable uh utility business that lends itself to a long-term relationship you know when you issue an RFP some of the people who propose maybe these quick and dirty llc's where you've got some investors who want to make some some money in a hurry and uh maybe aren't the best people to use for a long-term Arrangement also the RNG use would be within Northwest Naturals pipeline system uh so it's local uh we wouldn't be dealing with someone who wanted to sell the environmental credit somewhere else um Northwest Natural is also very motivated to have our they have a 30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction uh goal by 2035 in the product that they sell um they're also able to offer us a fixed price for the gas that was really a meaningful price uh we couldn't find that with other proposers um and it's important to point out that there was a new legislation that was passed in uh 2019 called Senate Bill 98 that allows Northwest Natural to buy RNG and actually invest in assets that create RNG and U basically pay the cost uh with the rate payer base that they have before that they were limited they could only pay uh the fossil fuel price for any gas they put in their system and since RNG cost more to develop they really were shut out of the RNG Market until the law changed um so uh that's that's an advantage that they have and that's why they could offer us a fixed price and someone who's a little more entrepreneurial wouldn't be able to do that they wanted to sell us the gas on you know market conditions indexes it could go up and down and and so forth so that's a big issue in relationship to an investor owned utility where it's on the investors to provide the the revenue based where this is customer based uh my other question is was this partnership uh did this have to go through an approval process at opuc as well uh the the project will have to go through one after it's built so the partnership didn't but the capital piece will it will yes okay yes Northwest Natural uh also you know has RNG front row Center in terms of its ability to uh to deal with climate change and uh and and so forth um I think it's essential that if they're going to survive they're going to need a lot of R in their system uh we have of course as I mentioned a goal they have of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%",

These conditions are imposed today under two different tracks. First is the conditional rezoning, and I know I'm addressing them in reverse order, but we're hearing them concurrently. So the conditional rezoning, I know we have, I haven't been before you utilizing this mechanism before, but in 1985, the legislature passed a special act allowing Marion county and the commission to consider conditions voluntarily proffered, which is the case here, by the applicant, that would be incorporated into the ordinance approving the rezoning, and then be enforceable by the county in perpetuity. So it would be a code enforcement violation, for example, or a permit would be denied if the applicant came forward doing anything inconsistent with those conditions. So what we did in that respect. Oh, historical note, our senators at that time were Karen Thurman and Dick Langley. So it's been a bit. The conditions that we've proffered, I'm just going to read them verbatim into the record, are first, the use and intensity of the development of the subject property shall be limited to a one story, 6008 square foot convenience store and gas station, which shall include no more than eight standard fuel pumps with no more than 16 automobile fueling positions. That's eight pumps, each with two positions and five truck fueling positions. And we're going to look at a plan in a moment that depicts that. Number two, improvement shall not include parking spaces for commercial vehicles exceeding 16,000 pounds. So no truck parking. And the 163 agreement goes much further. We'll get there in a moment, but from a conditional zoning standpoint, you can rest assured there's not a place to park a truck, much less to go inside and sleep or get a meal or use the restroom. Number three. All buffers shall meet the description of an a type buffer pursuant to section 6.86 of the Land Development Code, consisting of at least a 30 foot wide landscape strip and at least three shade trees and five accent or ornamental trees for every 100 lineal feet or fractional part thereof, together with shrubs and ground cover. When feasible, the foregoing shall be accomplished through preservation of existing trees and vegetation. And right now, it just happens. I think it's on my screen. Could we get this pulled up on the main screen if possible? The portion of the property that we're talking about, the southern boundary, is the tree line. Underneath that 24 da dash zero two. Tight the pointer to. Oh, yes, ma'am. Help. Now I'm going to pull a gooding and try to figure out how to use this thing. Yep. See, I told you which 01:00 a.m. i. Holding down. This is a gooding special here. He's already left. He can't. He's having trouble, too. There you go. All right. Thank you for bearing with me. So what I'm getting at is it's hard to see the tree lined roadway, but there is a very nice tree line on our southern boundary and also a very nice tree line along the entirety of the frontage on 329. So we have an existing buffer, so we'll be able to preserve a lot of that. In any event, those are the conditions of rezoning. So our request as it relates to the rezoning is to rezone based upon those conditions in your packet in front of you. And I've placed a stack at your desk and we're going to work through them. I apologize, but you'll find one that has a cover letter from my office. That was the letter proffering voluntarily our suggested conditions of rezoning. So as a first step in a threshold matter, Commissioner Zalick, I appreciate your questions. I appreciate I've been dealing with the same thing, and I want to point out early that a lot of the opposition has pointed to maximum intensity of this. You know, since we. I wanted to take down a larger prop, larger piece of property to provide open area and make it fit. And in turn, we were criticized for the possibility of building buckies. And that is not factual. That is not permitted. Our conditions of rezoning would prohibit it. We would not be granted that permit. So those conditions would guide the confines of what we are proposing, which is a gas station and convenience store. Next, I'm going to blow through this, but if anyone would like me to slow down and go into greater detail, please stop me. The other mechanism to ensure that we are compatible and that we are not going above and beyond what is agriculturally related is our 163 agreement. Now, before I get into it, there are two big. There's one major distinction between these two methods. The conditions of rezoning, unlike a 163 agreement, can't be negotiated in the course of a hearing. So I can't. That would be contract zoning and other. We can't do that. So those conditions are what they are. Now, the 163 agreement, as you're aware, during the course of the conversation of the hearing, if you have specific concerns or would like additional language, we can incorporate that because the chapter 163 specifically provides for these development agreements to be able to be negotiable during the course of the hearing. It's a legal form of contract zoning. It's a belt and suspenders. So, chapter 163 agreement, you will find that behind the letter I just referenced, there's both a clean draft and a redline copy I shared with Ken, Mister Wayrock, right before. There are two very minor changes that I'll reference as I run through it. Honestly, the first page, you all are familiar with 163 agreements that entitles the developer to the described use, which is what I've just described to you, subject to developer obligations. The first change that's not reflected in that red line, but is in mine is just approval of the traffic study. And that is. That is recital h. And so otherwise, the first two pages are identical. There's a lot of legalese and reps and warranties before we get into the meat, which is in paragraph four, bottom of page three. Can we have the PowerPoint, the racetrack PowerPoint, please? I'm going to skip ahead in this for a moment. So before we get to that, I'm going to go through the permitted use. And it is simply the use constituting a gas station, a convenience store that shall not include truck parking, showers or bathing facilities, sleeping quarters or automobile, truck or service uses. So those are specifically. It's specifically required to be simply a gas station and convenience store as we described. She cannot exceed one story. And then the dry vials have to meet the concept plan and we'll get to the concept plan. But that's a general depiction of the concept plan showing green spaces. These are all, by the way, referenced in exhibits, also to the developers agreement. So we have to be consistent with the concept plan that is incorporated as an exhibit. 5.4 just repeats those limitations on pumps that I told you a moment ago. 5.3, which I skipped, prohibits parking of commercial vehicles over 16,000 pounds trucks. 5.5 concerns preservation of open space. And the red line that you see actually came out of planning and zoning commission. We thought it was a good idea and racetrack jumped on board immediately. We had previously provided for all of the western portion of the property. And while we're looking at this image, I want to tell you there is a. The top of this image is our west boundary. West of that, there is significant area between 329 and our west boundary that will remain a one. So in addition to our buffering requirements, there is going to be property reserved. A one west of us and south of us, and it's a 27 acre parcel. So significant acreage providing additional buffering on those sides. But when I come back to the language, the open space that's in that proposed green space is limited to and to Mister Zalek's point. Utility infrastructure that will be on grade or below grade stormwater facilities, which will be done at our expense. And we'll get there in a moment. But just natural vegetation, landscaping, buffers and yes, a three board fence. So I will tell you, it's in no one's interest for trucks to park on our septic field. That is something racetrack is probably more concerned about than anyone. And there will be a three board fence. That was more appealing than bollards. Bollards was the other thing we considered to address that concern. There won't be any trucks on the western open space. But the red line language that came out of PNZ is the last sentence, which provides that upon request of the county, we, the developers, shall prepare, execute and record a conservation easement or similar instrument approved by the county attorney providing for the perpetual conservation of open space as described in this section. So that will be permanent. Some of these are repetitive, but in 5.6 we get back to that type a buffer. In 5.7, we require architectural design standards that essentially provide that it needs to be consistent with what we've done here in the exhibit and then in 5.8. Luckily, you all know this, but when I go to other jurisdictions with land use projects, I use Jim Coolyard's language for dark skies requirements because our code's so good when it comes to lighting. And so of course we'll be. We'll comply with Dark Sky",

        "text": "e e hello everybody Welcome to the uh Southwest Regional meeting for organ energy security plant um this our last meeting of the Road show so we're glad you're able to come um a little bit of logistics first um this meeting is being recorded uh so if you um by by being here you uh acknowledge and accept the fact that you're getting recorded um for folks in the room if there's an emergency there's an exit right out this to the right um and with that we'll get started um do we want to go around the room and introduce ourselves we'll do it after this next slide okay so my name is Tom Cecilia I'm the Hampford hydrog geologist and fuel specialist with the organ Department of energy uh I'm joined by my assistant director Max Woods Dr Casey Stedman and Andrew eworth from our Contracting team um and we're going to be talking about the energy security plan uh so let's uh that's who's going to be talking let's go around the room and figure out who else is here uh starting in the room yeah the only one Steve Vincent with the V utilities welcome and do you want to read through all yeah so everybody I'm just going to go down the list call your name please feel free to unmute and just provide a brief introduction um so we'll start with Erica good afternoon or good morning my name is Erica Mason work for the Oregon Health Authority Public Health division Health security preparedness and response as a hospital preparedness uh program Regional Emergency coordinator thanks Erica next one is GT o sorry if I miss so no you did good o good morning everyone GT o from Oregon Department of Emergency Management I'm the Southwest uh preparedness and coordinator great thank you uh Melinda Melinda can you hear us right we'll move on um we'll come back to you uh Phillip hi Philip now uh research and planning uh for the preparedness section o great thank you um Ricky hey good morning can you hear me okay yep great uh Ricky Hoffman I'm with Oregon Department of Emergency Management I am the Southwest mitigation recovery regional coordinator great and then lastly Rob there are two Rob so if it's two different people think I think I forwarded the link to Dan yeah Rob randis Public Works director for County yeah and I'm actually Dan Mock I'm with Josephine County at just using Rob's link evidently no worries um we're admitting one more person but we'll go back to Melinda you want to unmute if you can no worries um and then lastly Anna I just saw you joined please feel free to unmute and provide a brief introduction hi my name's Anna Murphy um I'm part of the Halen Aldridge team that did um some of the um planning for this project so I'm mostly here to observe great yeah thanks an thank you so I just as anide I think at one of the meetings last week uh there were four Maxes so understand having two rounds okay um so a quick overview of what we're going to talk about um just an overview of the energy security plan the project timeline overview of the methods then we'll take a quick break and um go into some preliminary results and then uh put you to work uh helping us rank mitigation strategies um we're going to be using a program called slido throughout the presentation um so during break you can uh there's a QR code that you'll be able to connect to slide up uh so first I want to talk a little bit about um who we are as Oregon Department of energy uh we're a One-Stop shop for all things energy in the State uh we uh have uh a data repository and Publications for Technology reviews um we do some some regulation um and um make policy recommendations to the legislature um the division that Max and I are in is the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness division uh we are the state's lead Agency for um response for radiological materials in an emergency and also for fuel supply in in an emergency for the state um which is why the energy security plan is a good fit for for our division um so today we want to like I said talk about what we're going to talk about so we can talk about it um we're going to share the project progress to discuss some results and then get your input uh you've met some of us um max and I are with the organ Department of energy we've got um folks from our Contracting team which is CNA partnering with Haley at Aldridge um representatives from both on on the called um we also worked uh closely with Oregon Public Utility Commission who is the state lead for electricity and natural gas emergency response uh so they had a lot of specialized knowledge that we're trying to utilize in the plan and then you um we know that all emergencies are local so it's important to have the perspective of the people who have have to live through um energy insecurity um to make sure that the plan works for you um it's not just a top down approach here so the energy security plan um is um in addition to just being a good idea to have um it's a mandate by uh both the federal and state legislatures um the energy security plan is uh was included in the infrastructure investment and jobs act to have all states and territories right one of these plans uh you have to meet all six of these goals and um the US Department of energy has contracted with Pacific Northwest National Lab to be sort of the evaluator of those goals um and uh the federal government provided some funding to all the states to do that and that's what we're using uh to to this plan uh they also uh said that if you don't meet all of these goals they can withhold future funding from the state so we have some incentives and other incentives to get this done and get it done well um and addition uh the state legislature through Senate Bill 1567 U gave uh Oregon Department of energy a additional um task to do uh in addition to the infrastructure investment and jobs act requirements we'll talk about that in a little bit uh so the goal of the energy security plan um is on the screen here uh the blue text comes straight out of the the federal uh definition we added the red for Oregon because it's important to be able to afford um whatever recommendations come out of here um we know that uh communities that have the financial ability to apply mitigation measures and and Harden their utilities um most likely have tried that and um and will do so in the future but those communities still need to have uh resilient structures and systems but might not have funding resources available so one of our Visions for this plan is to lay out some structure which then could be sort of shovel ready projects and could be used by um folks that might not be able to afford it to apply for federal grants or state funding uh to implement some of these mitigation measures um because we really want to have sort of a resilience and uh SEC energy security Equity throughout the state not just um for the folks that have abundant resources so in order to get this done we're pulling together all of the information we can find um and trying to synthesize it into one um easy reference so we're going to be using plans um that have been put together by different entities throughout the state um in some cases we're directly linking those plans in other places we're we're just going to be summarizing it um we're also going to be doing a little bit of data collection we've done some a lot of data collection and uh and some targeted analysis uh that our Contracting team will talk about um and we know that this is going to be uh a living document and we're going to be periodically revisiting it and we'll talk about sort of the strategy there in a little bit so I mentioned the uh additional homework that the legislature gave us the state legislature um through Senate 1567 uh some of you might be aware that there's another part of 1567 that directs the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to look at um seismic strengthening of uh large fuel tanks uh specifically in in Portland area um at the CI fuel Hub um but we also have a job to do and that is it's related to Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and looking at places where there's publicly owned facilities uh that we could increase fuel capacity um or recommend increasing fuel capacity so we're not talking about replacing the the Portland terminals but just um having uh instead of maybe one week's fuel supply at a public works yard maybe they needed a second tank so they could have two weeks and then they'd be two weeks ready in the case of Cascadia so um where we're where we've been so far is in heavy data collection mode um we had uh some surveys with the public sector and the private sector um we had um Outreach and engagement surveys thank you for all of you who committ uh contributed to that in the past um we're going to keep on collecting information even after this plan is published so we can make it better next time um and uh if you want to track sort of where we are in the project uh the QR code that'll get you to the website uh and a little tiny URL and then you can sign out to our mailing list using the email address there uh for you in the room there's also uh the QR codes over here so you don't have to wait for this slide so what's left uh this is our last uh meeting of the Road show where we visited every U OEM region in the state so all six of them we also had a meeting with tribal governments um we still are working on assessing the fuel storage capacity and recommending areas to increase that uh we're working on getting our plan ready for September 30th deadline from both the federal and state uh legislators and then every year we're going to be looking at this uh what needs to be updated and every for the federal government and the state required us to look at every other year so there's a lot of really good work being done in the state um there's um an environmental justice Council that is sort of defining what environmental justice means for the state in the next couple years um there's work being done on community resilience hubs uh there's work being done on County um energy plans energy resilience plans so we want to make sure that as new information is done uh new work is done by state partners and County Partners we we have a me a method of incorporating that work into this plan so we we're providing the best service we can for our uniion um so any questions on the the fire hose that I",

        "text": "all right good afternoon everybody hear that can you hear that in the back all right good afternoon everybody thank you all for being thank you all for being here today for the Marion County uh state of the county address thank you for to the city of Kaiser for hosting us today and thank you to the Marion County Commissioners for making time for us it's great to see everybody for such a great event here today I'm Mike Keane and I'm a shareholder at Garrett heeman Robertson and have the the honor of serving as a set Core board chair this we have a lot of visitors in the room today so I'd like to tell you a little bit more about sedcore which stands for the Strategic Economic Development Corporation which is a non-profit organization working with public and private Partners to build up and diversify the mid Willamette Valley economy said core's only focus is to grow and showcase economic development in Marion Polk and Yamhill counties by bringing together traded sector jobs and creating wealth for the local economy since 1982 sedcore has built and strengthened positive and productive Partnerships with industry leaders businesses business advocacy advocacy groups Community organizations educational institutions state and federal agencies local governments and said core's mission is opportunity and it is built upon the founding values to listen be creative act with agility and build to last this is done by thoughtfully cultivating relationships and working with Partners across all these sectors to keep and attract high-value jobs and capital investments in the mid Valley we do this by connecting people to resources and to other individuals and a phrase we know someone for that we do many many events like this and they're made possible by our sponsors said core would like to thank PGE for being our sponsor today and making this event possible thank you and I'll hand it over to Teresa Haskins past said core chair thank you very much thanks everyone hi Danielle foreign so I'm Theresa Haskins as you just heard I work at Portland General Electric my colleagues if you'd please stand I have some really great teammates who are here today from PGE and most of them work here in the region in the local office and so if you have any questions that you don't want to ask me ask them right so why do we invest in a forum like this there's a lot of things that we get asked to invest in and I think maybe since the start of this one we have been um I don't didn't fact check this but I'm pretty sure we've been the sponsor from the beginning and it's because we really value the relationship that we have with Marion County and with all the counties we serve which there are six of but being a local kid I care more about Marion and poke and Yamhill I have to say but you know everything from wildfires to Emergency Management storms capital projects large instruction whether it's roads or or water systems or whatever PGE has to partner and does want to partner of course too with Marion County and many others and it takes that kind of collaboration because we increasingly face constraints challenges working in the right-of-way having space for where we put these things that serve the public whether it's PGE facilities or or County facilities so I'm really excited to hear what the Commissioners have to say today and especially in this environment where we are experiencing a huge amount of growth throughout the Willamette Valley and we'll increasingly need to work together and be transparent in how we do that so thank you for for the opportunity to once again invest in the Forum so I am going to now introduce the Commissioners so first up and you don't have to run but you could like make a quick Pace to your spot up here if you'd like Danielle Bethel there you go thank you oh well I guess Kevin and column are gonna you know follow yeah anywhere you want is great so I'm going to do a quick intro here Danielle was elected to the Marion County Board of Commissioners back in November 2020. she's a local Kaiser girl um she co-owns Bethel plumbing and as a former Vice chair and director of Salem Kaiser public school board of directors and I'm not going to read through all of the things that that Danielle has interest in like the other Commissioners as well a lot of interest a lot of passion and what I want to hear is is what they have to share about that but in particular I would note that Danielle is a graduate of OSU which is always a good thing she lives in rural Marion County with her family and she has experience background with Marion County Fire District Oregon Public Utility Commission which I didn't realize we need to talk and the Oregon disabilities commission and she currently serves on the Career Technical The ctec Advisory task force Ann is a rotarian okay next I think I'll introduce Kevin next Kevin wants the short intro like this is Kevin the county commissioner and like introducing the president of the United States he said yeah that's all we need to say Kevin's been at these um doing our our state of the county addresses for about nine years at least and uh is a former member of the House of Representatives for Oregon and has been involved on said Core board and many meetings with myself and others and chamber boards and Detroit like Planning Commission Detroit Lake foundation board Oregon Governors re-entry Council Marion County Public Safety coordinating Council Regional Solutions advisory committee with the state of Oregon so many many things along with being a business owner um so welcome Kevin I did add to that sorry and then yes thank you and third let me introduce Colin Willis and Colin was elected to the Board of Commissioners in November 2018 and re-elected in 2022 and he served as the chair of the Board of Commissioners to through two major disasters federally declared or not doesn't really matter they were huge disasters and that's the covid-19 pandemic and then the Santiam Canyon wildfires so I really appreciate what that took out of all of you but your leadership in particular calm and he is involved with sedcore on the board here and has um is active with the Marion County budget committee the Housing Authority board the 4-H and extension service and what else do I want to highlight I think I want to highlight that before he came to the Marion County Board of Commissioners he served as an aide to the U.S Senate joint economic committee and represented small businesses entrepreneurs and non-profits as a business attorney so I appreciate that business background and he currently serves or volunteers with Catholic community services which is a non-profit dare to meet so I'm going to leave it there and let you guys take as much time as you need until you get the the yank I suppose I don't know which one of you is going first and it might be better to hold it but you can try this if you just a few thank you I'm not shy with a microphone and or a stage so we'll make it happen thank you Teresa and PGE and said core for hosting this event I um my previous life actually before I became a county commissioner actually the year I ran I sold an event planning company so I understand sound and how difficult it is for event planners to get it right and I'm actually going to move this because I feel like it's in my way and it's bad for pictures I'm just saying so um I just wanted to touch a little bit on the relationship that we have with Portland General Electric you mentioned the two major disasters that most folks know about the wildfires and the ice storm and Tony's here from Salem electric and probably other utility providers in the community but one of the things that I have learned most about being an elected official is that you're only as successful as the Partnerships you have at arm's length and we really do have a great relationship with Portland General Electric also Salem electric and others um my very first year as a county commissioner the ice storm hit in February so I was in I was in that seat for like 35 days and I was able to pull my community-based hat on as a chamber director and just kind of a Grassroots Advocate and get people's needs met and it was our partnership with PGE we had folks like Teresa Wendy valise others who were literally on speed dial for the Commissioners and our team responding all across Marion County which was the epicenter of that ice storm and I just I just want to say thank you again and then we had another issue last year where you know you guys your emergency response team is very communicating and transparent with the challenges that you're facing and I think that's important in a relationship because if I don't know where your downfalls are I can't come meet you there and that's our job as a county and County Commissioners is to show up where our people are and make sure that we're filling that Gap and so I'm going to talk a little bit about the passions that I have and the work that I'm focusing on as a county but before I do that I just want to introduce and welcome and thank a few people that are in the audience and first I just want you to acknowledge that there's a lot more elected officials in Marion County than the three of us so if you are an elected official that works in some facet of Marion County would you please stand mayor Hoy you should lead that way thank thank you if you haven't had a chance to get to know the different elected leaders in your own Community or your neighboring Community I would encourage you to do that because we're all a giant neighborhood and they're elected for a reason they have a passion that might you might connect with and they can help you over and out to whatever that connection looks like if you work for Marion County would you please stand Well normally I would love to just go Name by name and tell you a story about every single person that stood up Kevin told me I couldn't because I'm supposed to not talk for 20 minutes so I'm going to limit that but I also just want to mention that Betsy is here from Senator merkley's office sorry I'm sorry you probably just took a bite at food I appreciate you being here who's here Fritz is here Fritz Graham with congresswoman salinas's office um I almost got that wrong but I'm quick on the Fly Fritz used to work for a different person we love Fritz Marion um and then also near and dear to my heart Tom Hoffer and Corey filardo Salem chamber CEO and Kaiser chamber CEO would you please stand thank you okay enough with my",

that had been mothballed and they put them to use in this new place in oregon where they um refurbish them some put some new blades on and so rather than just have these go into the um into the trash bin we'll say they were able to put them back and they've been running well now so it's sort of inspirational for me great thank you so much and then i'll um go to mark nystrom and then i'm going to

house district 60 state rep which is now i think 37 of the southeast corner of the state look forward to conversations and learning so i'm going to take the easy way out on your question i'm going to say whatever small scale renewable that we can put forward in the future is my favorite project i love it solutions oriented all right i'm gonna keep an eye out for mark nystrom to turn his camera back on when he's ready um but we'll move on to mike mcarthur mike macarthur the executive director of the community renewable energy we've been advocating for small-scale locally owned projects for over 20 years we learned about this opportunity through the odo wind working group back in the early 2000s and we learned that it was possible through the public utility regulatory policy act for farmers to be able to loan their own wind farms and my favorite example of that is one that exists here in german county called patu nine megawatt owned by a family here from german county multi-generational family here on their wheat wheat field in their wheat field and they're selling their power so i think that's a good example of what we hope to achieve more of great thank you next up natalie hi everyone my name is natalie rogers i'm the i she her pronouns and i'm the climate and natural resource manager for the city of milwaukee i'm really excited to be here i am tasked with implementing the climate action plan for the city of milwaukee which includes a 2030 goal to be uh carbon-free generation 100 for our community so um really excited to be here i would say my favorite small-scale community-based renewable energy project is actually in milwaukee uh we do have the largest solar array on multi-family housing at least of 2019 uh and at our waverly greens apartments and i think that my favorite thing about it is that they um also have high tree canopy on the side so it kind of balances our tree canopy goals as well as our renewable energy goals so very excited to be here today great thank you so much hey y'all um can you hear me okay okay cool my name is nikita daryanani i use she her pronouns i'm the climate and energy policy manager at the coalition of communities of color or ccc um a project i recently learned about and one that i think is pretty cool is here in portland um in the culley neighborhood includes solar panels and i think storage two on saint charles church so i think that's really exciting and i'm looking forward to being here um and learning thanks great thank you so much um let's see i feel i feel i want to test out mark and see if mark nystrom looking at yes you sound great thank you um this is not the first time this has happened to me on webex um hi everyone i'm mark nystrom i'm i work for lane county i'm the climate strategist here we get to work with seven utilities in lane county so uh i don't want to leave anyone out but uh there's a couple that i'm really impressed a couple of community solar programs that i'm really impressed with central lincoln pud has a great one out on florence and uh uh emerald people's utility district has a great run down in uh tickets between cresswell and cottage grove uh with uh working with uh st vincent de pauls so happy to have both of those here in our great thank you so much and then we are at orianna hello my name is ariana maniara i use she her pronouns i'm the energy climate and transportation manager at verde which is a community-based organization um that does some project-based work in the colleen neighborhood in addition to statewide policy advocacy thanks nikita for the shout out to one of our projects uh the saint charles church project um i think like representative owens uh i'm excited about future projects as well and in particular we're developing three different community solar projects in the colleen neighborhood um all of which we're hoping to achieve cooperative ownership uh so that the community who are subscribers and members of the community not only get the the bill savings benefits from the projects but also are able to build wealth through the dividends associated with the project uh finance and and benefits great thank you so much rain peace hi everyone my name is uh rain feast uh viatoro and i'm with blue green lion my favorite project would have to be the rooftop solar at the ipw48 union hall so i think for me at booming alliance we work with labor environmental groups roads we always look i always love uh you know net zero buildings or on top our uh depression fall thank you and then uh ryan uh the director of customer and energy services for central electric not-for-profit electric cooperative in central oregon serving approximately 29 000 members and i would say my favorite there's a few favorites the micro hydro comes to mind for three sisters irrigation district and then the other that's pretty neat we did in 2016 our community-based solar which is 133 members bought into but i think the reason why i appreciated it was the accessibility and the opportunity to to you know quarter panel purchase options all the way up to our largest which is 24 panels one member has so it was a really neat project from an accessibility standpoint great thank you so much i was wondering if we might just like perfectly nail it because senator dumbo was coming about a half hour late but he'd be here when we got to him but he's not yet so we'll go to ready to tom i actually think that the others that we have left on here haven't had a chance to join us yet this morning i do want to give dan or zach a chance to see if his mic is i think it might be yeah uh hello everyone can you hear me we sure can okay so i finally figured out the microphone on webex but i don't have the video working yet we'll get there so i apologize for that i'm dan orzek i'm the general manager of the oregon and clean power cooperative we do community financed renewables in i would love to say uh we've done about uh two dozen community finance projects in the state solar and solar plus storage projects and i'd love to say that they are all my favorites um but i'd like to um give a shout out to the uh low-income solar uh low-income housing solar project that ryan sheehy and fleet development has in i believe in oregon trade electric co-op territory so i call that community solar but of course it's in a cou territory so um not in what we think of as a community solar program but um fleet uh battled entropy in several federal government agencies to make that project work and i think has really done pioneering work with solar and low-income housing great and then i think we also have um let's see dave moldall should now be able to participate thanks chrissy dave moldal the senior program manager with energy trust of oregon manage the custom renewable energy generation projects largely hydropower and biopower there are so many fantastic projects to point to but certainly want to underscore the amazing fleet of co-generation projects at the state's water resource recovery facilities that are generating about 50 000 megawatt hours of combined heat and power electricity renewable energy power for municipalities as well as the incredible potential for inconduit hydropower projects that have been identified through the irrigation modernization program got a lot of opportunities before us great to be on this group thank you so much and then um last but not least we have um mike from oregon cub is joining us bob jenks is uh filling a seat until staff i think is hired that he wants to fill the position right mike and you're here today for for that's correct thanks christy um we do have a couple job postings open so dealing with some turnover internally but i'm here today filling in for bob for the moment my name is mike goetz i'm the general counsel of the oregon citizens utility board we are the advocate for the residential rate payers of the investor-owned utilities throughout the state and um one small-scale renewable project that i had the uh the pleasure of visiting a few years ago is out in lake county in lakeview oregon um where the the hospital and a few of the schools have been retrofitted for uh geothermal heating there's a lot of uh there's a lot of um like hot springs and kind of geothermal activity in that region and they've been able to harness some of it and yeah it was a cool project to check out great well thank you so much for sharing that are there any members of the study work group that i missed you can raise your hand or go off mute and i'll also look at the attendees list to see every once in a while it's hard to log in as an attendee so if i missed anybody there you can raise your hand and i can bring you off mute this is steve huffleman i signed in late sorry i had trouble getting one no worries thank you so much for joining us we're sharing our best example of a small scale renewable energy project and from what i hear you've been responsible or helpful with a lot of them do you want to give an example for us well there are a couple",

        "text": " heard from different stakeholders to require that public notice be given that we're requiring the information requirements for the noi and the application be revised to require the applicant to provide that contact okay um next is an issue related to the construction of the three standards that we're looking at essentially the scenic resources and recreation standards uh limit the scope of council findings to resources within the analysis area identified in the project order the protected area standard uh does not require that kind of limitation and to improve consistency between the three standards we're recommending that the scenic resources and recreation standards be amended to to remove the reference to the analysis area basically next are a couple issues that were raised by stakeholders during the rulemaking project uh the first is that uh we got some comments that the study areas so that's area that needs to be used in the analysis for the noi are too big for facilities but especially for renewable energy facilities solar facilities in particular we are not recommending any changes on that time that i can go through kind of some of the thoughts and alternatives that we considered uh we also got a recommendation that the council limit the study areas to just areas with within oregon's borders so kind of clip them at the edges of the state we're also not recommending changes related to that next and there's two issues related to kind of the the date uh the dates used to determine when things are are applicable and or when things are things so this first one is that in the protected area standard um there is currently a limitation on the council's ability to consider uh or basically the definition of protected area doesn't include anything designated after may 11 2007. the idea might have been that we would keep the rule up to date but that hasn't happened and since that time there's been a lot of new protected areas uh designated so we're recommending that we remove that date um allowing the council to consider impacts to any protected areas that are after that review but also established during the review of a proposed facility and so i'll get into that a little bit more during the more detailed conversation the next issue which is issue four is that the protected area standard contains a list of categories of protected areas that fall within the the council standard um but also some specific examples and some kind of sub lists and those sub lists are incomplete and out of date in many cases we've proposed some kind of mostly administrative changes to remove all the specific examples and make the rule just a list of categories and hopefully that will be more clear and will reduce the need for future rule making to keep things up we considered an issue uh to whether or not the council should add uh outstanding resource waters designated by the environmental quality uh protected areas under the protected area standard um for a few reasons we are recommending against doing that uh and i can describe those reasons more later um issue six is that uh we had looked at some of the language in the exception from the prohibition on citing a facility within the boundaries of a protected area uh for so certain transmission lines and gas lines can be cited within a protected area if a certain extension is uh i don't know some of you may remember the council had a discussion about the wording of that exception some time ago uh and we are proposing some clarifying language in response to the discussion really issue seven is that uh the scenics resources the scenic resources standard does not basically include scenic resources identified as significant or important by state land management plans but it does include uh resources identified by local tribal and federal plans so we are we are recommending that the council of in the standard to include state plans and uh regional plans as well and i'll describe in more detail and then this is the final kind of summary slide uh which was all new issues raised during the process uh and one was just related to the applicability of any new standards several stakeholders were concerned that if we were to change the standard while a project is under review it would prejudice the applicant for that project we discussed a lot of issues we discuss some options to kind of address that in a more general way but while we are that the council specify in each of the rules that we're recommending for changes now um that that the rule will only apply to uh new new applications and requests for amendment um so i can describe that further but again this is the second of the two issues one is related to uh what do you do about the applicability of standards and rules and what is what do you do about new designations of protected areas um try to make sure to keep those clear um the issue nine is that a lot of people uh raised concerns that council's scenic resources standard and i guess all three of these standards that consider visual impacts need to be more specific in the methods that are used to assess visual um we had a lot of conversations and quite frankly uh i think there was a lot of agreement that there there could be improvements the way uh the council or applicants i guess conduct their visual impact assessments um but because of that's kind of technical and and not well the technical nature of the issue and the lack of consensus about what specific uh methods would be appropriate uh we think that a separate rulemaking would be appropriate uh just to address that issue and i'll talk about that more kind of when we get to the next steps uh and then finally we had one comment that recommended the council clarify the criteria for identifying important recreational opportunities um again i think we agree that in principle there could be some improvement made but we didn't actually hear any specific recommendations from stakeholders on how the rule could be uh so we're not recommending changes now although we may um bring this issue back in the future um and then one thing that's listed in my staff report and i didn't list uh in this um but is related to ms gear's comment is that a lot of people kind of brought up the issue that we have standards that protect the different kinds of protected areas and some of those protected areas are designated to protect their ecological values i guess and the kind of impacts we look at are typically impacts to human users and a lot of people said we should be looking at maybe impacts to habitat i think this gear brought up specifically impacts to native plant and things like that and so they just wanted us to be looking at the psychological values and ecological impacts as well as human user impacts uh particularly when we're considering the evaluation of protected areas designated to protect ecological values which is a mouthful um we don't have a specific recommendation or really even issue kind of associated with that concept now but it was a theme that came up many times and it's something that i think will definitely carry forward into our application process review rule making uh when we're looking at all the standards and kind of maybe looking at how these standards interacts with the fish and wildlife habitat standard and the threat and endangered species standard uh to see if there is really a gap in what we're reviewing and if there's some way that we can improve um the way that we look at these resources specifically okay so that was uh the quick rundown uh there's any questions now i'm happy to answer them otherwise we'll can go through these issues a little more slowly and uh in a little more detail thank you are there any questions for christopher at this time okay um so the first issue as i mentioned is related to notice to proper uh protected areas managers the council's rules kind of have noticing requirements at several points throughout the citing review process i like to think that those noticing requirements fall into three major categories um the first category is that in several places the rules require um solicitation of comments and recommendations from reviewing agencies those are typically our state agency partners that might have subject matter expertise over a particular area we'll get them to comment on the dnoi to identify the initial scope of the review and then they will be involved in the completeness review for the preliminary application to make sure that uh all resources have been addressed and that any important issues are uh the second big category is public notices uh which go out slightly less frequently than the reviewing agent thing notice but also completely throughout the process and it's it's a way to inform the public about the proposed project and also give the pro uh public an opportunity to raise any concerns um that they may have with the proposed project and then the third category is property uh owner notifications which as you all know uh gives notice to people that own property immediately adjacent to a facility um so that they one know what's happening right next to them and two so that they can raise any concerns that might affect their personal interests as well there is currently no requirement that we would give notice to a protected area if that protected areas just in the study area a proposed facility unless it was already considered a reviewing agency or it happened to be located within the property owner notification distances uh which are typically uh between 250 and 500 feet for our and that that's from the the site boundary or the edge of the property that the site site is on uh but still it's not a very big distance uh when we're considering the 20 mile study area for protected areas um we looked at three different alternatives and in a nutshell those are one taking no action and just relying on those existing notification requirements all right two um specifying that anytime a protected area is identified in the noi uh or in the asc that the manager that protected area is a reviewing agency and will be asked to provide and recommendation at all the times that reviewing agencies is asked to provide comment and uh and then three requiring that public notice be giving to the protected area managers at any time i wanted to give you all just an idea of what the universe of protected area managers are most protected areas in oregon are either managed by one of four of the federal land management agencies that's the national park service the bureau of land management the forest service or the u.s fish and wildlife um state protected areas are typically managed by one of three state agencies the department of parks and recreation uh department of state lands in the department of fish and wildlife um there's a small subset of protected called state natural areas or as the rule currently refers to them state natural heritage areas that are designated by the oregon parks and recreation commission but they're actually owned and operated by other and some of those are operated or managed by private entities uh including the nature conservancy or another land trust and sometimes",

        "text": " it almost doesn't really matter because it's visible to the the community there it's benefiting the community there through savings we have two low-income apartment complexes that are linked to it where we're just donating this the subscription 100 so it's like 100 for the tenants and we are embarking on a community energy planning process with energy trust and um we are hoping to someday get to the point where when the power goes out for 10 hours like it did last january um we can actually maybe use this local generation to plug in and provide some backup to key buildings so i think unless you're you know if if you're not building it in hometown like community solar allows you to do then you really can't get there on that sort of resiliency so it's not a player yet but i i'm hoping that in the future we can work with utility to to make something like that happen awesome thank you so much ryan we really appreciate hearing from you and we talked a lot about community solar last time so i think it's definitely something that will be including the it's complicated yeah it is very complicated and uh i've struggled to understand it sometimes i'm not still not sure i understand how billing works i've been thinking about it for two years um i would just like to close with that uh in in future discussions with this group if anyone would like to talk about the difficulties of doing solar on apartment complexes which i think is an important part of the infrastructure that needs solar i would i have a lot of information on that as well so i won't talk about it today but great good to know all right thanks ryan all right um ryan i'm hoping you can stick around and see if anybody has any questions in the chat i don't see any hands up but if anybody has any questions for ryan if you could hang out for a second to see if anybody has any absolutely thanks ryan and then we can move on to the next alrighty yeah thank you ryan and in addition to sticking around for questions um you know this is really great information that we may try to pick on you as a resource for the broader work group and in future efforts as we put the report together to get any lessons learned and and potential recommendations around community solar developments on apartment complexes so thank you for agreeing to take some take some time to share with us today all right moving on um i'm gonna hear from lori hutchinson and this one is uh we'll hear about some barriers but laurie is with obsidian and obsidian have they're kind of a shining star in oregon as one entity that has learned to overcome some barriers and really develop some really excellent projects with that laurie um i'm hoping that you are she's at the um spot she should be able to meet herself yeah great okay so take it away i think i'm on uh and i had just one slide rob um uh thanks everybody uh i think well the next slide actually um yes thank you rob for the glowing obsidian has been developing in oregon since 2009 we built the first i believe we built the first utility scale solar in the state for both pacific core and uh and we have continued to stay local no matter how hard it is and we've continued to evolve as policy changes and i wanted rob to put up this slide today because it's just kind of a map of several oregon solar policies this is right outside of the town of lakeview you can see the town of lakeview in the background this is about 11 megawatts total so it gives you a good reference scale for herba projects were when we were able to get standard contracts up to 10 the projects here are it's a complex of projects that we've started build you started developing in 2009 uh the first project is in the middle it's two megawatts for pacific core um to the sort of bottom side of the picture there are two smaller projects that were built under the short-term feed-in tariff program in oregon those are both less than a half of a megawatt and then wrapping all around those two projects is eight megawatts that we did under purpa purpa you know as i think this crowd probably oh and there's one more program in oregon that's represented on this photo there's a tiny little um net meter project that serves a 4-h farm that we worked with the local community to to build also in the bottom of the picture so perpa uh is kind of in the rear view now for most developers you can still develop and get standard contracts up to three megawatts we were really participating when you were still able to get standard contracts up to 10 megawatts the main thing purple just at the state and the federal level was sort of a way to sort of grease the wheels to allow more more diverse participants in providing uh in providing energy and it really worked here in oregon we had a very successful purple wave between about 2014 and 2019 um and the the drivers of that success were the solar industry had matured enough that we were able to compete at avoided cost and then the simultaneous ability to get a standard contract from the utility for up to 10 megawatts at their avoided cost basically de-risked one of the four or five things that you need to develop a solar project and so i think our experience like a lot of developers was um we took more risks it was pretty common for perpet developers in oregon to request contracts and then try to prove out the concept uh you know with all the other diligence that you need to do the interconnection studies the land studies um cultural studies and you know the local permitting and so as a byproduct of that um you know there the the purple wave although a lot got built under it we also have a lot in the scrap heap that didn't get built and that was all part of the learning curve of developing utility scale solar and sort of feeling out the grid in eastern oregon and southern oregon brick by brick or substation by stud station by you know pulling those studies and doing the you know paying for the studies that you need to do to to learn about the grid so i i consider the short-term prepa program in oregon a big piece of where we are now with with utility scale solar it coincided with with prices coming down you know on on the more grand scale but it also drove a lot of the learning you know we were able to build out you know several developers not just ourselves we're able to build out you know portfolios of 10 megawatt projects that brought um the experience that was needed both within the utilities you know when i you know the first utility interconnection meetings that i sat through in 2013 versus you know where we are now there's just a greater level of sophistication and understanding of of how we incorporate diverse sources of power and then just other things i i was really relating to some of the discussion about um uh ahjs you know the the permitting authorities and their learning curves and i i even recall uh while i was wearing a hat as a as a representative of osea the state industry association i remember an eastern oregon um code uh uh inspector calling me and saying you i'm getting applications not who can i talk to like i don't i don't know i don't know how to evaluate these we really we you know kind of where we are now with with the wave of larger utility-scale solar stands on the on the learning that we did between 2014 and with these perpa projects purple was rolled back by the public utility commission um i i think it was premature it was you know that basically it it kind of you know the the utilities were pushing back on the numbers of of purpa applications they were seeing and the public utility commission fell in favor of the utilities and and cut back the cap for the ability to get a standard contract uh they cut it back to um three megawatts and that was in 2016. so basically you know people who had contracts in their hands then were you know had a few more years to build out those contracts and so the end of the purple wave was basically at the end of 2019 when those projects were either built or they fell into the scrap heap so um like a lot of developers we have evolved when we saw that purple was dying in 2016 we decided to go bigger and so we're we did um put in an application took us a couple of years to get it together but we did acquire some land and put in an application for a project that has gone through fsec and now has its site certificate that's really audacious thing to do for for a company of our size so sticking to purpa i wanted to just quickly go through some barriers that i think apply to small scale in general i mean the main thing is and i and i don't think actually too many people have spoken too much to it today but like the scale of interconnection requests to the investor owned and to bpa is just off the charts from where we were five years ago um for example we have a smaller application in with pacific court in lake county where we've built several we've usually been one of a handful of in the interconnection queue and there are 3 000 uh just in that in that study area that pacificorp is looking at and that's mainly larger projects uh some of it's on behalf of pacific core themselves they're looking at doing pump storage and so the access to the grid for these scale of projects is kind of a you know it's a it's a pretty precise shot right now there's there's so much power trying to get out of you know the less populated areas of oregon and back to load area and um and the problems that we're seeing all over the country with with transmission and and an old grid that's being you know that we are you know we're investing in as we go but um you know to the scale of bringing all this power out of eastern oregon or wyoming or montana um that's a that's a much greater thing that's needed so i suspect that smalls you know there there won't be a next purple wave even if we fixed all the other problems without sort of uh",

programs Enterprise Zone tax credits in its initial push or push that off to the end of session pushing it off to the end of the can really leave the phoneable to not being able to leverage the important piece that is for us as we see the significant resources to be able to take on any other burdens that might come out of the rest of the policy choices that they're making um and so overall I think that the county really needs to step forward with a clear method that in pursuing this opportunity we need three things we need to have that continued partnership with the state in the gain share program be a part of this package and it must be brought up the current payment and then index for the future second the state has to find those resources for local governments to do the work that will be required related to the rest of the package we be it infrastructure planning um land use planning any sort of thing that where the local government Bears responsibility there have to be resources that come with it not just to pay for the physical infrastructure but for the planning and processing around it and third that any sort of land use choices that the state is going to make needs to come with sideboards that protect those plans for the intended use of supporting our fifth application and our eligible Partners so if we are going to make heavy Investments of time resources planning public conversation around anything related to land use there needs to be sideboards that really protect the process both for purposes of speed but for longevity and long term so I just wanted to throw that out there for you guys to start to have this discussion make sure I haven't gone too far afield as we continue to have these conversations but really the key message is it have to be a package that fits all pieces that affect local government at the same time we can't afford to not know that game share and sip won't function for us if we're required to do more work and turning that's the first big issue there's a second big set of issues that I'd like to briefly raise as well so yeah so really good summary uh Aaron and uh what I want to checkpoint with the board is are you all thumbs up for this this three key message subset for what we need in this process I think I'm fine do I I don't understand if there is land planning I and I can get down to the super sighting between us uh are they going to carry the ball and are they what is that part of what we're talking about so I think if if I could take a crack at this Erin uh what you're talking about the sideboards is that that's yes yes on the sidebars board side this super exciting to use that word is for a very specific purpose right okay and I agree but we need to be clear between locally and state what the purpose is and making sure both in the short-term immediate term and long term that if for whatever reason the specific uh time frame doesn't work out or said companies decide something different that the intended purpose is what is operationalized as opposed to oh well it's just sitting there let's put a shopping mall on it or something the land usually go back to what it was yeah that that it's it's been designated for this for this specific purpose and that purpose should stay with it for the long term or revert yeah yeah that I don't have a problem with that person I'm thumbs up that I I I I do have a question along with this are you looking for Testimony at this point Aaron or how let's agree on the bullet I'm first thumbs up on the bullets if everybody's thumbs up on the direction that you've proposed excellent thank you for next steps thank you on that so on next steps I think um what I'll do is I take that and I will kind of create some sort of written document and we need to and I'll work with all of you on figuring out who can be available there is not a request for Testimony quite yet but that is forthcoming because they are trying to get this package put together I think what needs to happen next is organizing how we speak to our delegation about the importance of that need particularly on the game chair piece because that's the piece that's most vulnerable right now and so I'll put together a plan for having some of that Outreach being done by each of you to show that across across our board there is agreement on the position of Washington County on how we are going to pursue this opportunity and what we need in return for it as a go ahead so we Road tested some of this these draft messages yesterday you know pretty pretty clear uh information there uh some uh the committee has had their very specific topics the one on Monday was on industrial lands piece I think I remember it right yes um one of the things that I'm looking out for Next Step wise is the Willamette water supply project both sorry I should keep my mask on spoke about their infrastructure need for the drinking water to be used for any such Advanced manufacturing plant but we well know as the board of Clean Water Services that there's the outflow and that there's infrastructure costs related to that let alone some new Advanced manufacturing site with surface water but that doesn't I'm not too worried about that um so I wanted to make sure that we provided our teams with the direction to cover that base so that we're part on the CWS side as part of the equation for what the local infrastructure need as well yeah yeah you're all comfortable with that yeah yeah okay and I will be chatting with Mark and Tracy and Joe about how to kind of quantify some of that and what the overall need clean water services is in this process um as soon as we're all available which turns out to be Monday um I think for next steps with the legislature this is really about getting our delegation motivated to push for us as part of the package in the near um and figuring out when it is the best time for us to testify before the board that Washington County provided the partnership comes from the state side is a is a partner in this conversation so if I might to to help for lack of a better phrase Corrales a little bit on this so it's February 2nd in February is a little bit of a short month but it also has a few other things going on so three of us as the rolling agenda sheet says will be traveling to Naco for us four of us now that's right so each one of those line items under the February 14th column needs to be updated ASAP to reflect what days you're going to be mine for example says February 11 to 19. this isn't not an optional request folks here's why um Aaron and uh Zucker need to know who's going to be and able to respond physically uh to meet face to face let alone by um so I know for example that after my Naco work the 11th through the 16th that I have I need to go do family things I can't make phone calls then uh so they're really asking uh to have our act together and if you're on vacations that's just fine no problem we just need to be clear with them about our availability that's all does that make sense yes but I would like to just say for me and me only Erin if uh I I'm going to be taking days ahead of the Naco conference but if you need me I will be in internet so if there's a need reach out to me Megan knows how to get a hold of me I can be I conversely can be available so I need to Megan yeah and you you're good at corralling me sometimes could you just put together a table for Aaron Doyle um for the availability of the five of us the wins and the house that'd be awesome thank you very much as we try to make it as easy or easier for you less complicated for you as possible thank you for that and we'll get that coordinated and I appreciate Megan's help she's great at um corralling me as well so um so if there's no further questions on the semiconductor stuff I want to move to a second emerging issue that's kind of come up in the last 24 hours for it could I could I ask one quick question on the semiconductor I haven't looked at the agenda for the ledge committee on uh Monday for AOC is will this come up at all in AOC in your in your crystal ball in my crystal ball no for a variety of reasons um but I haven't actually looked at the agenda for the financing governance um yeah I'm still putting together the Community Development natural resources pieces of my brain for tomorrow and public safety for tomorrow oh yeah there's a lot tomorrow um so uh there has not been a move at AOC to push this I think there might be something around the long term Enterprise zones and if that is all in the Wheelhouse of the the counties that they are paying attention to right now I think that they're um we instead turn to the Eastern Oregon counties Association and their external lobbyists that they paid for separately outside of AOC to provide that partnership on being fair because they're another big user of the Sip and gain share program and having skin care extended for 10 years with the cap affect them don't affect them just because of the income tax revenue but the long-term stability of the program really does so that I will work with Rocky on that so but um I just want to be prepared thank you yeah and if that changes I will make sure that you have that information as quickly as I hear it thank you moving on moving on the other big thing that has come up in the last 24 hours which caught a number of us that Lobby in the local government World a little bit by the price which will have potentially some profound impacts in the Metro region it's um bills that have come forward around taxation um and",

        "text": " to subsequent development. That will happen at some point down the road. That is not part of this application, but we would apply those standards to future development if and when it came in on the site. I hope that answered the question. That does answer my questions. And again, I just bring up those concerns because of the actuality of the communities there. Even though we've done everything accurately, it still doesn't mean it doesn't have impact to the surrounding area. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Any other questions? All right, do we have any discussion? Yes. Is anyone else concerned about the impacts of those surrounding businesses with increased industrial traffic that potentially can take place there? I do not. And I know that this area, my understanding was, has long been an industrial use, future industrial use, and when Metro brought it into the urban growth boundary, that was the decision that was made at that time. And this application is consistent with that. I do think that in the future, to address your concern, we may want to go out further than 500ft, given the size of those parcels and the proximity to that urban rural divide. But that, that isn't the case right now. So that's something I think a future council can consider when industrial land comes in close to the rural part of our county. So. But I'm going to vote yes on this because it is an allowed use. Applicant did everything correctly. We process this correctly, it's. I don't think we have a choice but to approve this. Any comments from folks online? Yeah, this is Councilor Sanchez Aleto. Just since I'm not there, I just wanted to state really quickly that I did have an opportunity this week to watch the previous meeting and to hear the discussions and votes from the things that were on the agenda last week as we move forward. And in regards to this, as far as concerns, I think I have more wonderings and concerns. But I have been through a process as an educator where we are neighbors with industrial companies or other sites. And luckily, especially in a community like ours, it's always been very cordial, there's always been a connection. And so I would not think that it'd be different. Hopefully, moving forward, especially Hillsboro is very fortunate to have a strong partnership with the Hillsborough school district as we developed, having that at least dialogue with the folks that it would impact and so. But I do agree with Councillor van Vernon said about perhaps a discussion. I don't know where it would be in regards to this. Sounds like this 500 foot piece would be a completely different process to even discuss or possibility of change at any time in the near future. This is Councillor Alcare, and I agree with Van Bevern. Van Bevern also. But I don't know why we couldn't consider making these changes in a more timely way. And I also think that at the time when this area was first established, that we were likely facing different environmental circumstances than we are possibly facing now. And so I think it would also be mindful to start taking a look at whether or not we need to reevaluate what we consider to be sound natural resource use of these areas. Thanks. Thank you, councilor. And to wrap up the discussion, you know, I don't have concerns about what can go on that, you know, what can go there. It's less than ten acres, so it's not going to be a huge industrial facility. I thought it was 9.74, but even so, it is not one of the multi hundreds, if you will, acre sites. And, you know, having. Having been a principal up in North Plains and worked closely with Roy Nickerson and Dave Getling and others have visited that school many times, you know, that there are. There may be light, there may be noise, but there is definitely a smell up there already because of the dairy. And, you know, and when kids, you know, would ask, what's that smell? The response was always, that's the. The smell of money. And so there are already, you know, agriculture uses there, you know, which provide unique characteristics of the country, I guess we can put it that way. So I think, you know, that this will work nicely. I would caution, you know, having been on the planning commission for a number of years, I would caution changing this or going beyond this or going outside the state law for notification. You know, that 500ft is from the edge of the property. And so if a rural piece of property, another farm, another. Another field is within that 500ft from edge to edge, that farmer or that landowner gets that notification. And so even if we want a thousand feet, that just might mean you're farther into the field, but you're not notifying any more people in the area. And as soon as we change our practice and then it becomes a precedent. So if we do it a thousand feet for this, then all of a sudden we open ourselves up to challenges as to why we didn't do it for a thousand feet for this request and this annexation on and on. So I think we would be wise to follow the state law and not go outside that. So the last thing I want to say to be clear, I agree. I respect everything that my fellow counselors have shared. The reason this specifically gets brought up for this agenda item is because of how market Marion acres being directly across the street, which is a part of that 500 foot aspect, it's the livestock I'm concerned about, which is their livelihood that's there and affected by the increase of traffic. So that's one thing I wanted to make clear and that's why I advocated for this specific agenda item. Very good. Thank you. So any other questions? Discussion?

        "text": " level all of this is in an effort to also reduce our risk should we should we have the ious incorporate equity and resiliency considerations into the iou risk frameworks and to what extent so that we can potentially support not only our resiliency goals as well as our uh renewable goals and our reliability goals but also our environmental and social justice goals this is where we are at we have begun workshops to to discuss the kinds of metrics and definitions that we might want to incorporate we have uh had one workshop on the interruption cost estimate tool we are having another workshop on the resilience node cluster analysis tool that identifies the social burden index the social burden index is an index that potentially well that does provide insight as to who is working hardest to get their needs met based on the time and money that they're spending in disruption and uh the tool has the capacity to in this way reflect historical inequities that have been thus shine light on that so that we can potentially provide mitigation measures build the rectification of that into our grid planning processes we'll be continuing with these workshops through the end of this year a staff proposal will be submitted in q1 quarter 1 of that's all and i'm open to questions great thank you so much roseanne this is all very interesting to us i'm sure um you said you already mentioned an answer to angela's question that indeed this was legislatively mandated um do we have any other questions and just so folks know we have about 45 minutes left and three presentations so i'm going to answer anything yeah i guess there's a few questions in here okay so yeah um go ahead so in track one um and two of our um had the ious develop a local government portal where by it's a restricted to local governments and tribes to access this information but basically the portal provides information from the utilities capacity of the grid where projects have started to increase capacity or address issues it also shows areas where public safety power shutoffs which is the planned outages in response to hazard events that might be occurring in might occur and what areas were impacted so it has information that local governments can access and use information use that information to inform projects that they might want to take on in order to increase their own local resiliency what we are looking to do is uh we are engaged in a project where we're trying to identify helpful would it be to local governments to be able to communicate to the utilities what their priorities are and where those priorities are in their local geographical areas so that utilities can take this into consideration when they're determining their decision-making protocols or they on either their de-energization plans or alternatively in their investment coincidentally at the same time that bi-directional communication piece would also help local governments understand what the utilities are doing and what they aren't so local governments can um leverage resources to provide that that resilience thanks roseanne i'm going to ask a couple i'm going to ask one more question that's a quick one and then we have two more um if it's at all possible us to be really mindful of of being concise that would be awesome um just given the time um angela wanted to know what the name of the power outage tool is the power there's one is called a power outage economic tool poet and that is being developed by lawrence national labs and the other one is the interruption cost estimate tool um calculator ice calculator and information on that can be found just by googling those okay great cool and then we also have two questions from grant so for undergrounding are you looking at that mainly for fire prone areas or more currently because wildfire is the largest and most broad hazard in undergrounding is there's a very large undergrounding project being proposed by pg e although the protocol their decision making protocol for where those investments are currently going where they're thinking of is not has not yet been determined general consensus is that it should be directed towards areas where it would reduce the potential for starting fires or allow for other areas to stay energized because there are some times when transmission lines or sub-transmission lines have been had to be de-energized in order to reduce fire the possibility of starting fires areas that have been safe to energize have indirectly had to be de-energized so undergrounding would potentially help in those areas okay great and then this last one and again um just um if there's other resources that you can point us to that'd be helpful too this has been like so helpful to think about potential options for oregon when looking at microgrids have there been conversations on community ownership and operation or will this be incorporated into utilities as a way to improve resiliency and reliability and then that'll be our last question um the answer to that is both um and the consideration of what what we're talking about community when we talk about community ownership our community microgrids we're talking about in front of the meter that are in front of the point of common and would involve more than one customer currently there is uh one project called the redwood coast airport microgrid that is a in front of the meter microgrid was just commissioned last week that provides power in times of disruption to more than one using both utility distribution infrastructure as well as private ownership these this topic and is more quite complex and is part of the track four conversations on multi-property tariffs and also the microgrid incentive program and you can get more information on that on our website if you look at our resiliency microgrids webpage and the track four issues well thank you so much for making the time roseanne we really appreciate having you and if you want to hang out for a little bit and see if there's any other questions that pop into the chat feel free but thanks for being here and then we'll go ahead to the next presenter and just a heads up that we've got like 40 minutes now for the last three presentations so i'll probably when you see my face come up it's me being like hey it's been 10 minutes how are you doing do you want to pause for questions go for the whole 15 talking your choice all right and it's a great segue um bringing up the redwoods that will be discussed a little bit in not the next presentation but the following one um but for now we have another exciting micro grid to discuss um kevin is going to talk to us about the beaverton i'll give it over to you guys good morning everyone kevin whitener with pge and uh oh thank you um i'm with in pge a group we call our grid edge solutions team which is finding ways to integrate renewable energy and um integrate in with that energy storage and resiliency opportunities and so a lot of our projects are sort of um you might think of them more pilot kind of projects um trying to get these up and running so that we can get some learnings under our belt um and be ready to employ all of the the nice analysis that folks like roseanne is doing you know to justify and understand the economics behind these if you would the next slide please so just a quick history here and i think kind of an interesting history is pge embarked on this technology about 11 years ago we built an r d facility we called the salem smart power center um it was a five megawatt battery with one and a quarter megawatt hours of storage so in terms of real usefulness um you know on the grid it was pretty limited because it had such a small energy capacity but starting 10 or 11 years ago pge started doing uh some technical testing of this system on our distribution grid we did some islanding we did some grid we tried you know some experiments picking up the load on the feeder so it was a front of the meter kind of micro grid attached at the distribution and we just gained a tremendous amount of understanding about these systems and i think it was fortuitous that we did that in addition to that pge you may be familiar with pge's dispatchable standby generation system which is where pge utilizes our customers um standby generators um for grid services when they're not being used in the event of an outage they're being used for grid services and pge has had that program for about 15 years now and it's really been a stepping stone to understanding these more complex microgrids that pge is launching into if you would change the slide again so this is one of our more recent microgrid projects that we launched into referred to as the beaverton public safety center um it's actually it's a police station in the city of beaverton and we worked closely with this customer and added that to the micro grid so clearly a behind the meter micro grid it's structured a little uniquely in that pge owns the battery um and of course the the city of beaverton owns the solar and and the diesel generator but pge did the work in terms of integrating those systems together and making a micro grid out of it next slide please so you were looking at an artist concept there here's an actual drone photo that kind of shows the and you can see they have lots of great up on their roof if you look at the lower part of the photo there you'll see the the diesel generator and the battery and you can go to the next slide okay so people always want to know what do these look like um this was a lot of one fun aspect of this is that what looks like a truck container in front of you is actually the one megawatt four-hour battery provided by a company called powwin in tualatin oregon so we're really excited to be able to do this work and pge is is uh learning and investing and we're doing that in partnership with a local manufacturer of uh energy storage products so um we're really fortunate in our area we not just pow wind but we have another battery storage manufacturer right in our backyard in wilsonville so there's a lot of and manufacturing expertise that's that's coming to oregon and that's pretty exciting so if you would the next slide we were we were in the infancy of doing this when uh i just really appreciated roseanne's presentation because they've done such great work into getting in the details of of planning these resources and understanding the economics behind them and pge was doing this without maybe",

with their election right now then we will review the land use requirements and we will work with Lynn County to seek their input on if they were going to conduct the review what are the requirements if there's anything that's unclear how they would interpret and if they would issue conditions what kind of conditions so we want to seek their input on this as well next slide okay I'm going to turn it back over to Nancy could you could you skip ahead to the applicant slides please I'm gonna I'm gonna make one more announcement because I know some more people come in so we had a lot more people show up than we thought um we recognize you're coming in probably still early than what you um but late from the starting if you if later on once we're done with this we you want us to restart this we'll restart this whole presentation uh with fewer people in so you can either stick around you know kind of catch the rest of this or come back in a little while and we will restart this thing all over again yes I'm sorry I should have made that announcement earlier this is being um so if anybody wants to watch this um we will post it onto the project website if you know of anybody who was not able to make it tonight you can import them to the project website um likely it'll be tomorrow but it could be a day or two before it gets posted but yes the entire thing will be posted on the website yes it is way back yes it is people can phone in people can I don't know how many people are participating remotely but yes okay and with that we'll hand it over to the um for their sites uh good evening everyone my name is Paul Hicks I work with tetratech engineering um well I am not the applicant I work on behalf of the applicant uh in in a few things one is working on developing the application for site certificate that's being discussed tonight the other is supporting doing the environmental survey work that's being done for the project and other aspects that might support permitting for the project so that's my role our role is Tetra Tech and appreciate your time this evening and good after or good evening my name is Brian Tran I'm the development manager at Q cells and I'm the applicant for the money Creek energy Park project next slide please so we have a few things on our agenda for this PowerPoint um if we could just go ahead and move on to the next slide please so I work for a company called Q cells uh Q cells is a vertically integrated solar developer based in or wow for copper graded means the design and produce our own solar panels uh we have a team of which I am a part of actually develop solar projects throughout the United States and we have our own construction Manatee who oversees the destruction of our projects um two things to note is that our panels are actually produced uh here in the United States we have a factory in Georgia where we produce all our modules so they are us made and we actually minor own silica material solar panels here in the United States my team we focus on development of projects solely in the United States and our EPC team is actually ranked uh up 10 in the United site please so we're here to talk about a project called money Creek uh money Creek is a proposed dual use project that is sized at 199 megawatts with a battery storage component we're hoping to uh also incorporate sheep grazing on this project as a dual use component it is located just about eight miles south of closer to the Coburg area just north of the Coburg Hills area our study area is or the facility site boundary is what we're calling it is a roughly 1500 Acres this includes areas mainly for study so when it comes to environmental analysis bread endangered species Etc this is kind of the area that we're focusing on with our preliminary studies and desktop analysis we're kind of thinking it's going to be closer to 1100 Acres when it's fenced uh currently the project is non-irrigated dry land uh dry crop and it's currently growing rye grass it's fortunate we can't grow rye grass and have solar at the same time but we're hoping to keep the project in production or the the land itself in production um the land is 100 leased from the landowners so we did not purchase any of the properties for this project right now um we're thinking that construction would start no sooner than the third quarter of 2025 and it takes about 18 months for construction so we would be most likely done by the end of 2026. if for the substation there is an existing substation there it is called The Diamond Hill substation it's 230 KV and we already have gone through the process with the utility uh to go ahead and connect our project at least with an agreement what we call a large generator interconnection agreement next slide please this here is a facility site location kind of like a vicinity map the area that is aligned in black is the study area that we have um and it might be a little bit hard to see but it is just west of Harrisburg and north of Coburg next slide please um so not that one we can't make updates to that or change it but we we have a the computer screen uh once we're done here we can zoom in we can zoom in on a lot on the properties um if anybody wants to kind of stick around and and we can kind of walk you through that a little bit later sorry East okay so this map is a little bit more zoomed in um kind of like the site uh layout or overview everything in Black is our study area um and it might be a little bit hard to see there but there is a green square that's fall like a line long green square is the existing uh Diamond Hill substation and one thing to point out is that there is a vertical blue line on um just to the one last object that is the I5 so the project itself is solely on the east side of I-5 and some of the infrastructure in this area does also can we that is the road but the substation itself is named Diamond Hill next slide please okay so moving on to the need this project um we we didn't start from we didn't kind of just throw a dart and just landed where we are today there's a lot of extensive research that kind of went through this to get to where we are um we've know that there is a need for generation of electricity less of the um this project itself would be able to power approximately 30 000 homes in the valley um we cited it here uh mainly due to the close proximity of the substation that means that it's right next to the existing infrastructure we want to have to build miles a mile of uh infrastructure to get there um and it just makes it there's capacity already on the substation so we had it through extensive list of criteria which I could talk about our process in a little bit there's definitely need for and then again we we Define our landowners to lease us their land in order to get here uh where we are today so if you don't mind moving to this is kind of like a different type of thing that's the same thing that our counterparts on the over here have shown us already um purpose is that we are going to start or have already started on our and that was going to be started in Spring and will continue summer but if pay attention to the first exciting Mountain facility um how we got here today is that just a great local grid analysis we have a set of criteria that we look for when it comes to substation side effects um so we have a bunch of Engineers kind of run that for us in whatever state or area that we want to potentially build in and then they go ahead and give me a list of stations like LLC this could be anywhere there's a couple and after that we had to go ahead and speaks for just look for uh any whether threatened in your species Wetlands things of that nature and then so we go from a list that's maybe about 2 000 and we go down to maybe five and then after that we actually do landowner Outreach that is us getting a list of contacts and mailing addresses from the county uh doing a lot of mailers phone calls and then doing a lot door knocking the entire process takes about two years it could be anywhere from sixth year or six months to two years um and then at that point we had to assemble a team um and then we submitted the noi so it's been two years in the making to try to get to this point where we are today but even then we're still right smack dab in the middle or in the beginning of it at this point we're doing a lot of community outreach trying to get to know the community more see who the key players are get in contact with them have face-to-face meetings with them get some more opinions um but as a Todd and Chase have already uh reiterated we're at the beginning of this and we're here for public comment and we want to hear your opinions please hope please hold your comments we have a formal q a plus just to recognize we have a lot of people or at least some people online so you're gonna have to come up to the mic when you're ready to comment so people online can hear you as um so please hold your comments but we will take all of your comments and next slide please so I was talking about some studies that we didn't do this is a list of the field studies that way to do physically on the um some of them started earlier this spring some of them will start in a few weeks or just in the summer and these are expected to be done by the end of the summer next slide please so this here is uh the study area um Todd and Chase had",

        "text": " webinar Kellen Target weather senior citing analysis analyst at the Oregon Department of energy will provide an overview of the amendment process and changes proposed for the amendment request miss tardyweather you have the floor for the for the record Kellen tardy weather senior citing analyst Oregon Department of energy thank you Vice chair how um and I want to welcome um folks that have joined us in the room here tonight and online and I'm just going to get underway with my presentation overview here oh I do want to say there is a little bit of lag in between when I uh um because I'm running the PowerPoint presentation there's a little bit of lag in between when I change the slide and then when it goes on our screen here in the room and I imagine online so um just bear with me but if I'm talking and you're not seeing anything just give it a give it a couple seconds so this is um generally what we're going to be talking about tonight I'm going to be um describing what the approved facility is or and the citing process I'm going to go over what the amendment request is and then we're going to um the the steps associated with the draft proposed order and the comment period on the draft proposed order um we're then going to have a public hearing where Vice chair how is going to be the presiding officer both he and I are going to provide an overview of the requirements for commenting on the DPO um and then we'll have the public hearing so and this is not specific for b2h this is generally the format that we have for any hearing on a draft proposed order for type A amendments um and so the the certificate holder whose Idaho Power will be will have an opportunity to provide comments on any aspect of the DPO they'd like um members of the public will be allowed to provide um oral testimony or written testimony and then Council will be provided an opportunity to um make comments or con uh or concerns that they have and then um it'll end with an opportunity for the certificate holder to respond to any of the council or public comments so for folks that are not familiar with the energy facility citing Council we call them f-sec or Council um and the council's process is intended to be a Consolidated review so it's a place where a energy developer or an applicant or a certificate holder can come to get the various permits necessary to construct and operate an energy facility in one place the council is made up of seven members that are Governor appointed Senate confirmed folks with a diverse array of backgrounds from all over the state myself and my colleagues in the siding division at the Oregon Department of energy are staffed to fsec we provide legal and Technical review project management and do things like we're doing today um uh to assist Council in their review and decision making folks that are familiar with the process this slide is a little bit small uh so I apologize if it's hard to read for the folks here in the room um this is very typical of um this is for an amendment but anybody that's also used to seeing an application for site certificate we have the same process steps uh functionally Amendment follows the same process steps that we do for an application for site certificate both a preliminary Amendment and a preliminary application are submitted in a preliminary form and we go through a rigorous completeness review back and forth with a certificate holder until we deem a Amendment complete and then we post the complete Amendment and use the information from that complete amendment to draft findings and recommendations in a draft proposed order when we issue that we issue notice excuse me and then that stems a comment period uh with an in-person hearing from pay amendments which is why we're here um there and then there are additional steps there are still more steps I'm going to talk about more than them later but one of the takeaways for folks that I want them to see from this is that we're about in the middle of the process there's still more to go this is not the this is not the end um to when Council makes a decision on this amendment so just a quick overview of of what the approved facility is so back in September last year Council approved the application for site certificate and issued its final order and executed a site for site certificate for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission in that site certificate in the final order it approved what was then called the proposed route that came the drought which again hard to see in this figure which is the the red line and then part of the application included several art um and so those now uh those Alternatives had names like the Morgan Lake Alternatives which is now just the approved Morgan Lake alternative um and then um and then there were several rebuilds associated with that approval as well um the related or supporting facilities uh included with the transmission line include several access roads it also includes multi-use areas which are construction sites pulling and tensioning sites communication stations um also in that approval Council approved a longhorn substation in um and then this facility crosses um five counties in Oregon so what is in request for Amendment one okay so um let's see a request for Amendment one the certificate holder is requesting functionally to add in more Alternatives so just how in council's final order where Council approved the kind of the the main route and alternative routes that allows Idaho Power in its final design to select either route so here um Idaho Power is requesting additional routes to retain the the flexibility to then construct those routes so um uh rfa1 combined 8.8 miles of transmission line route reroutes in three areas and about 46 miles of uh modified Road reroutes and we'll show we'll look at some maps and see that a lot of those roads are kind of associated in just a little bit of a bump out of a previously approved Road um and then uh Idaho Power also requests to amend site certificate language now um and that is in rfa1 now in the draft proposed order um folks will see that the department actually makes several recommendations for amended condition language too and a lot of this is just um kind of like looking and reading the condition understanding what it applies to and to make it more clear and better implemented there's also descriptions and rationale for those revisions in the draft proposed order and make a note when we get to the slide about this okay oh oh that's real loud um uh when I get to the slide where we talk about the scope of council's review I'll kind of try to remember to touch on this but if it is if it's uh pretty much anything in that draft proposed order is open for for comment so um if folks would like to comment on any aspect of that draft proposed order they may do so okay again a little bit hard to see in the room um but this is the little Juniper Canyon alternative in Morrow County the Shaded area is the approved route um and so we can see here this is just kind of a little bit of a bump out extension of of that approved route uh the little Juniper Canyon is a 1.4 mile alternative and the the segment it would replace is 1.3 miles so this is 0.1 miles longer than the approved route then here this is going to kind of stagger in here it is in the order kind of going from north to south and then the this is the true blue Gulch alternative in Baker all right there it goes so this is what I call like the elbow it kind of comes down from the previously approved route and then turn to then connect back up with the previously approved route um the true blue Gulch alternative is um 4.6 miles it would replace um 2.9 miles so this would be 1.3 miles longer than the approved route and then lastly we have the Durbin Quarry alternative we're down in malheur county for this and this is similar to that little Juniper Canyon it's just a kind of a minor adjustment from the approved route and this was to avoid impacts to an ODOT Rock Quarry and this alternative is 2.8 miles but but the associated approved segment is also 2.8 miles so there's no difference in in distance with this alternative okay so this is my my scope of review review slide I'm gonna I'm gonna try to leave here we're gonna go on a little trip bear with me and I can't see anything oh no okay hold the header all right there we go oh well there's a lag so bear bear with me it's all part of the the the grand scheme of things here we go okay and share okay all right and we're gonna do what um we love doing in our industry is staring at some rules let's see if I can make it bigger okay so this is the um in division 27 this is like where council's um rules for amendments are so this is what we look to when we get various amendments because as council's um amendments to site certificates come in kind of all forms and shapes and so um so really what the question is the question that council is answering um so this is the the preponderance of evidence right to to Grant an amended certificate Council must determine that the preponderance of evidence on the record supports the following conclusions so now this is for so here under a so when we're adding area to a site boundary the question is that are those are the portions of the facility added to the site boundary do those comply with the count with the laws and Council standards so that's that's really what we're looking at for this because we're adding areas to the site boundary and then for B you know this is a construction deadline extension so this is not what we're looking at here but this is just kind of to compare the questions a little bit different of what council is finding depending on the amendment and so really for a construction extension we're after considering like changes in fact or law that it the question is does that the facility complies with all Council standards um and then we we don't need to relay this too much and then so for any for a request for Amendment not described above then councils would be finding careful it'll stop there we go that the facility with the changes complies with the loss so there there is that I'm going to try to go back so I wanted to go through that I don't know if Council has any questions but I just think that that is um interesting and it helps guide um",

        "text": " of the rules um you know I think we agreed probably with a lot of of the comments that Mr Kreider made um but it you know it's not just an overall General cleanup of the rules if it was we would be doing a lot more work than we're proposing here um please remember that this is just phase one of three phases of rulemaking with an intended sort of outcome it's really just setting the stage up for phase two and then phase three so while it is a cleanup of the divisions you know that Chris is talking about today um it is sort of narrow in its scope to really set up the the phase two and the phase three um which are more trying to get the you know application um requirements and the standards better connected and and you know these really help that um by pulling some of the information out of you know the you know division 21 the application requirements division 22 the standards you know in order to then you know set that up for the next phase so again not to say that Mr kreider's comments weren't good and we probably agreed with a lot of Mr kreider's comments just not in the context of this particular rulemaking thank you for that for that right uh thank you madam chair thank you secretary Cornett and um to Echo what chair Grill just said um if any of the council members do have a question or or would like to comment on any of these rules please feel the feeder interrupt me um my participants pane is on a different screen right now so I'm not looking directly at you also uh just speak up and I will um being happy to answer any questions chair Grail uh this is Kent yes I share how I think this might be the appropriate time for a couple comments I um as it relates to a recent application that we dealt with that uh a number of us land use wonks we're getting into the Weeds on the on a goal three exception and I use some probably poor language in when we were in the hearing process and said you know this needs to be buttoned up and um and my uh comment there was to the applicant and not to staff and this phase one the purpose is to separate and to make it easier for an applicant or a member of the public to understand what the applicant must do compared to what the staff must do through the citing process and um and so I felt kind of bad that it seemed like the staff really uh went back to work to the drawing board and to get it to where it was something that um the council agreed upon uh met the test and I'm just wondering that I thought should have been work that the applicant did and maybe this isn't the place for that distinction to be made when the applicants got to go back and do some additional work to make it clear that they're meeting the requirements of the rule or not so that's my question kind of this main phase one may not be the place for that but since this is the one that's kind of I thought was to understand what the applicant must do compared to what staff must do I wanted to raise this as just a discussion point any comments so do people know what I'm referring to as far as when we really were needing more from the applicant I'm not sure the applicant provided a lot more the staff worked it around to get it to where it was acceptable to the council but um that wasn't my intent I wanted the applicant to do a better job of providing the information clearly to us Chris I can respond to that um so yeah thank you Meister how I don't think we were confused by your comments um so if there's any concern that you had that we were confused um we we were not so we we were clear about that but but in terms of how that uh applies in this rulemaking it it does it doesn't really apply in this this specific rulemaking okay but getting into and it goes back to exactly what I was saying is this rulemaking sets up phase two and phase two sets up phase three and really phase three is going to be a set of rule makings um looking at the specific standards and the specific application requirements and so your comment right now really you know I think has applicability towards phase three when we get into say the land use standard and so that will be a question where we look at the land you standard and say you know based upon statute obviously you know are there any changes that we should make to the standard itself and then looking at the standard what are the directions and and Clarity if any can we make to the application requirements um so that really what you're talking about you know will come out later on in phase three when we open up the land use standard I don't know the answer to the question if we're going to do anything but that's where we'll evaluate that to say again should we can we make any diff uh changes to the standard and then again you know how much more clarity can we put into you know into the um the application requirements um which then feed into that standard so so we will get to that question um but just in phase three okay thank you uh that's what I wanted I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing an opportunity at phase one to deal with this uh and it sounds like just hold my horses and wait till phase three I appreciate it and uh yeah we were like I said we were clear on your comments or at least that was great okay thank you thank you guys remember how yes I hear Vice I hear council member Condon I think or is that councilmember buyer buyer this is constantly for buyer and just I really appreciate the effort to clearly outline the responsibilities of the applicant and the department and I think Vice chair has comment that we carried that through as we look at the standards is going to be really important I think it's makes for a cleaner process for the applicant provides some ease for the department and also helps the public better understand who is responsible for doing what so I think we're setting a good a um outline for moving forward with any rulemaking thank you thank you for that comment okay Chris I think it's back to you thank you chair girl and I will just add as a you know the former rules coordinator and uh someone who's still thinks about the rules a lot um you know to the extent that the accountant Soul can um think of of what sorts of evidence that you want to see um when we get to those other phases of this rule making you know the rules can certainly be amended to reflect findings of adequacy for evidence and um findings that set the standard for the applicants burden of proof as well as standards for what substantively uh needs to be happy during the design construction and operation of facilities but uh that's all I'll say on this um I'm sure Tom will also be very interested in this conversation so we'll make sure he he's aware um and if you can move to the next slide uh we did get a comment letter from renewable Northwest um there had been an early recommendation to use tables to some summarize some of the rule requirements particularly the noticing requirements the staff is recommending that we publish these tables on the website but um the recommendation to include them in the roles themselves is not moving um in part because of some of the Secretary of State's requirements about rule structure and and how you can display tables in the new electronic uh rules system um renewable Northwest recommended to adding internal references about where language has been moved to um so you know giving a formally at uh oer 345 kind of reference staff I think agree so that could be helpful in the short term but in the long term it really isn't uh necessary as people get to use the get used to the new structure of the rules um so we're not recommending adopting that change but um Tom has prepared a crosswalk document I believe similar or or the one that's attached to your sap report and we'll post that on the website as separate renewable Northwest uh recommended clarifying weather applicants were required to attend informational meetings on a complete application um staff did make a change clarifying that that is the case that applicants are required to attend all informational and then um the renewable Northwest also saw clarification on where the new requirement to provide a public notice to a uh the managing agency uh that that administers a protected area appeared in the rules um staff uh staff to provide that clarification in the staff report I and just to clarify that is another substantive change but that is one that Council had already committed to making when we completed the protected areas we're making last year okay and uh next slide please um and then the last comment we got was from the Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association or osea um their comments were generally positive although they did raise some concerns with the changes uh I described before about coordinating with the applicant on the distribution list for uh or the notice of intent and the preliminary application um I already talked about that a little bit so unless there's other questions I can move on okay next slide please um so since you last saw the draft proposed rules there's been just a few small changes um one of those is that we are not recommending to renumber the contested case rules right now um the council will be looking well staff will be bringing like I can contact the case rule making that's already on your schedule uh to you in the near future and we just thought it would be appropriate to address those rules and not rule making particularly since uh some of the current rules um maybe amended or removed um so just to prevent a duplication of effort there we are proposing to weave those where they are for now um the second change is the removal of the notice chart suggestion as I just uh stated and then some updates to references to the new rule for the appointment of special advisory groups as I kind of discussed we are also proposing to remove the distribution list requirement in general um the rule already states that the distribution has to include the reviewing agencies for the department and the rule for reviewing agency says that the council or that the the department has the discretion to adopt um additional reviewing agencies on it in addition to the mandatory reviewing agencies that are already required um so this distribution list requirement was kind of a um no longer no longer necessary in nope sorry uh next slide please um this is what I just talked about so one more slide thank you um",

potential for it but i i don't know a lot about that and know that it's a topic that's under discussion currently i'll also mention that in a in a little bit in the slide there is a topic on economic development where this might come up again i also see kathy has her hand up so we'll go ahead and unmute kathy for me is that a yes yes we can hear you thanks okay i had a follow-up to my question about uh allowing fishing um since we have some offshore with offshore wind not necessarily floating but offshore turbines on the east coast um what's the experience with whether or not fishing has been allowed to continue in those operating areas so there um you know there is the the construction and within state water there are five wind turbines in in operation and then there's also been the constructions of two two turbines um that was the block island wind wind project and then two in federal waters um with a as a research project off of virginia and so we're starting to see um what that looked like but there is still fishing that occurs outdoor these these turbines um so there was whether or not um for the construction of um the turbine there could be a buffer area to exclude any type of activity while while these these devices are are being installed and and even to that extent i'm i'm not sure if there was a buffer um implemented i know there has been examples of that in the world around the world um but we uh we are still seeing as proposed in in the construction operations plan of activities and its environmental review there is fishing within the projects area and also do we have any experience from uh europe as to whether they keep their fishing going they've had the offshore wind a lot longer than we have so that's a that's a good question i think they're um i don't know the answer i think where where this becomes a really interesting question for the west coast specifically is the floating offshore wind energy technology with the floating platform and the associated cabling mooring and and a dynamic c cable that that's suspended in the water column um and there are a few examples of floating offshore wind that are that are worldwide and i don't know the answer for that for you know how fishing is in within that okay could you make make sure that that's listed on the inclusion of questions that need to be answered um i wanted to go to a question in the given the speed with which the technology is advancing and the implications of impacts and so many things fishing industry recreation and commercial exclusion or preclusion of use habitat changes species impacts ocean impacts impacts to shipping ocean conditions uh marine mammals and birds what is the rationale for not keeping the lease areas as small as in order to learn as much as possible and then find answers to those potential impacts before going larger and then lori commented that that's a good before we go to the answer there i did want to note that we have a break scheduled um after this topic and then we need to move on to the ports topic but we have time at the end if we want to revisit citing and permitting as well as continuing to welcome feedback in written form through march 25th to flaxsen's question i think um i remember whitney talking about the sort of winnowing down and getting more data as we know more but i'll turn it over to whitney to expand on that yeah i think it's a a good a good question i mean vome is under um you know we have our regulations that that dictates our our process and i think we work with our with our partner then you know as a part of our um sort of data gathering and outreach effort for the years leading up to this you know the discussion of the approach in oregon to to define these large areas for further consideration um with was the approach that's that's being taken and in the um by doing that you know we're making this the the call becomes public and area identification we you know we receive public comment it's a transparent process and and um continue to work with our partners to to narrow in these areas if if we were to take an approach of looking at a very small area um you know we're we're predetermining where that sighting should occur without all of that input as a part of both process without that full public comment period you know and and i think that having a small area um it's determined that that area is not suitable you sort of start its uh square one again in bomb's process and that you would put out a new call um so you know i think there there are pros and cons to different approaches and and by start starting large and continue to work with the with the state and the task force and um you know tribal members and then our public comment period and all of our other um outreach and engagement efforts we're able to do this this winnowing yeah thanks whitney um yeah there's kind of a tension too with um economies of scale and trying to figure out you know the commercial viability of these so i know you noted that bums noted that in kind of their background information on the call area sizes so i don't know if that that needs more elaboration but hopefully that helps not only the size for economic developer economic viability i guess but um 100 clean targets you know affecting kind of the scale of resources needed not only in the ocean but on land too so large amounts of solar could be built and kind of the same challenges with sighting and permitting are happening on land is is what is kind of the beginnings of what what's starting to come out into the ocean space thanks for that addition jason and for those of you who didn't get a chance to tune in to our kickoff meeting jason provided a great summary of the sort of renewable energy um and climate change targets that have been established in and across the west that has sort of been driving a lot of this interest um i wanted to go to a hand raised from karen go ahead karen yeah can you hear me great so um i wanted to go back to the question about fisheries being excluded and just wanted to add to whitney's description which you know which i understand and thank you for that information but i wanted to add that some fisheries will be excluded by practice regardless of whether there is a regulatory prohibition and some of our west coast fisheries uh that might be might fall into that category would be things like ground fish trawl midwater trawl where you have large nets that are the tool the fishery uses to the catch those types of fisheries gear do not interact well with large structures in the water and would lead to significant loss of fishing gear which then could potentially cause secondary entanglement with protected species like whales and birds and so that essentially could be a group of fisheries that even if it's not prohibited from interacting you know from fishing and around the structures by practice would not be logistically feasible or smart for an individual to use that kind of so i think that's important to keep in i think that until we have um ideas about the types of fisheries that might successfully interact within the turbine areas i think from from my perspective as a fisheries manager i'm i'm anticipating that fisheries would largely be excluded writ large from these areas so that's that's just kind of how i'm approaching thinking about potential impacts and and interactions even though that may not be 100 percent and then i also wanted to to just add that i think that the large to small process the winnowing process is really important and the call areas that are out right now need a lot of work in order to narrow in on the right areas within them that would be minimizing impacts and would be good for the energy industry and so on and there's an additional concept that i heard that i think should be part of oregon's consideration in this study which is phasing in projects not just the winnowing down good areas but then once you start starting with a project that's that's at the appropriate economy of scale as jason but perhaps even the entire three gigawatts all at the same time um and allow a stepwise phased-in process so i really appreciate that that question and i i think that should be a consideration in the study thanks thanks karen um another question from laurie and then i think we're going to need to uh break for uh 10 minutes before moving on to the next topics but just a reminder that we have hopefully time at the end if you want to revisit any topics and we're welcoming written feedback um on this discussion today by march 25th so lori's question is will the state apply the same standards for esa impacts to offshore wind development as it does for terrestrial industries several esa species have significantly restricted industries like forestry and oregon can we expect to see the same approach used by the state to ensure esa impacts from offshore wind are minimized not sure if um andy or or karen from the state want to weigh in on that um yeah i'll go ahead and take a crack at that one um we will carefully consider any of the consultative advice and review that happens in association with the production of a of an eis from boem when they are looking at project elements and their interactions with natural resources specifically whitney mentioned consultations with noaa or consultations with the u.s fish and wildlife service and when the state is conducting its federal consistency review we will look carefully at those documents those would be part of the necessary data and information which should be required for the state to make a review decision whitney do you have anything",

        "text": " to us to make changes in the proposed order that doesn't mean that that shouldn't be the right choice I'm just telling you the reality of it so you're not obligated to have the review of the DPO tomorrow that could be done at a future date but if you're interested in keeping that on the agenda then you just need to be thinking about the timing you know how you know what's what's fair to you know Miss Gilbert anybody else to be able to respond what's fair to the certificate holder and being able to review and respond what's fair to staff to be able to review and provide you know responses to you and what's fair to you to be able to legitimately review all of that information that's that's kind of what we're getting at Mr chairman Vice chair I would say it would depend upon whether staff felt there is a benefit for the council to review the proposed order tomorrow but on the other side of this in terms of extending the the deadlines uh the council has heard all the testimony that's provided orally I doubt if all of us have read the written testimony that has come in since some of it has come in during this meeting and some of it is a little bit more lengthy than the oral testimony so I think if the council is potentially going to bring up issues they should have adequate time to at least read the written testimony and I don't think any of us are planning to read it tonight to be quite honest so that raises the question kind of this other information aside whether to remain you know to have the record remain open do you feel that you have um Time by tomorrow during that agenda item to review the written material I can only speak for one person one member probably not because I'm because we're going to be going through the other agenda items before that and unless I'm planning to get up earlier than the 6 45 a.m tomorrow I'm planning to get up at uh I don't think I'm going to have time to read it actually in detail thank you Vice chair how um just looking at our emails we have uh received two additional um comments the b2h and Miss Greer's and then this Gilbert's we've had the trails Association of comments for another day for about a day and I I haven't looked at it in any with much Steph how are you feeling for the record kill and tardy weather uh I'm feeling great thank you for asking um so just I'm gonna I'm just to outline because we've kind of heard a lot we've heard several comments in the table of contents for stop b2h's um comments um I'm just gonna go through they they organized it very well good job guys thank you it's 17 pages so they raise issues of access roads and piecemeal review issues of maps creating an inability to review the RFA with a specific specificity uh changes to Wildfire plan non-compliant re-evaluation of the required Bond as necessary non-conform conformance with Oregon's Forest Practices Act changes to helicopter use requirements removal fill requirements significant changes in the requirements regarding the blasting plan and landowner notification and that's in the main body and then they have two attachments that are supportive of the forest Practices Act item and then Susan Gear's comment is focused around the rice glass Hill area that is a protected area now under council's rules um and so uh we are we're prepared and comfortable to continue with the review of the DPO tomorrow um we just we could give Miss Gilbert until 10 a.m and then maybe Idaho Power until 11 A.M um that does not again that and so what we would what we would do I have slides prepared right in my staff report prepared that Council had um that is pretty lengthy um it is contemplating council's review of the draft proposed order and then what we would really try to do is focus in I would kind of pivot the presentation to focus more to be responsive to comments raised and um what the applicant and applicant responses understanding that it's we wouldn't have like draft language ready in the proposed order to look at but we would be kind of unpacking those issues a little bit more but we are comfortable with being able to do that tomorrow so if I can throw out an option which would be pretty much exactly what Kellen just um and then we could start on the review of the draft proposed order tomorrow and maybe we could conclude with it but if you then felt maybe there's not enough time you know the days going long you didn't have an adequate time we could get through probably most of it tomorrow and then we could postpone the rest either to the next council meeting in August or because there might be sort of smaller remaining items we could set up a virtual meeting prior to the next council meeting where we could then finalize the remainder of those items if we aren't able to get through it all um thank you I at the risk of offending Ms Gilbert and with all due respect I'm there you've been probably involved in this process certainly a whole lot longer than I have but um it strikes me that um that you didn't know that you could comment on it and it was a DPO you know it there it was a draft proposed order that always allows comments for any anything contained in it and so I don't I'm a little bit concerned that um you didn't know and what we could have done to mitigate that um and given counselor Rose comment um do we now does that open it up if we allow this does it open up to everybody or anybody who says I didn't know I could make comments so and I I don't mean any disrespect because I certainly appreciate you your Engagement full engagement in this I think I would actually it's not my microphone can you hear me no it is I I think it's fair because what you're trying to get at is did she have is there a good cause for her requesting the extension that's what you need to put on the record if you think there is good cause and council member Conan is spot on because this this is beyond just this request this has impacts on future on such requests in the future so people will look back at this meeting say they granted It for Miss Gilbert what is the good cause she's alleging that the notice in some way was deficient what she ought to do is look at the notice and figure out do you decide that it was deficient in some way should she have known that she had the ability to comment on changes and conditions if you don't agree then you should reject it if you agree not only are you allowing her to extend the comment then you essentially are instructing staff to make revisions in future notices yeah there's a suggestion there is that an easy thing to pull up and let us take a look at the notice that was sent we can certainly bring the notice up the the legal requirement in the rule does not talk about that I mean I think Kellen brought up the rule language we can certainly bring up the rule language it talks about what needs to go to the note is but that specific it doesn't talk about specifically in an amendment the idea that somebody can comment on conditions that is not in the rule yeah okay so our our again you can take a look at the rule language you can take look at the notice none of it's going to contain that information and it's not legally required to contain that information okay so it's basically what you're saying is past practice it's uh we well I mean we follow the requirements well we go well beyond the requirements of what has to be in the notice to try to provide enough information but that's just I mean yeah that's just not that's not required and we've not put that in there yeah and there's there's a whole host of things in an application or an amendment that it would be an impossible list to try to describe what people can comment on and I think as we talked about everything in the DPO the draft proposed order is available to comment on um so I have the notice up here on my and I I guess it's I mean it is a kind of in inherent that if it's a comment period on the draft proposed order that you could comment on anything in the draft proposed order um but here in the I mean we kind of specifically we talk about the transmission line roads and then modifications of uh site certificate such conditions is this what you're thinking this bless you all right sure how thank you I think this is pretty specific what it what it includes what rfa1 includes and then how to raise an issue but it is of the whole Amendment request and the draft proposed order it doesn't limit it anyway it doesn't talk about any limitation in here to to anything right it's general knowledge General right free to talk about anything yeah if I could Point your attention to the last sentence under the subheading description of amendment requests it says rfa1 also seeks approval to modify condition language for several Council Rowe you said the from the legal standpoint of what we're doing is looking at whether what's the wording again standard is good cause so do you think there's a good cause to extend the deadline yeah counselor buyer at the risk of being kind of ornery um based on what we have just gone over and based on what we know I would suggest that we find that there's not good cause to keep the record open and again no disrespect to any of the people who provided comments but just understanding that we set precedent with every action we take and this probably doesn't rise to the good cause um test or doesn't meet the good cause so having said that I would suggest that we close the public comment as originally stated in the written materials I think it was at the close of this hearing and allowed the applicant to respond by 10 AM tomorrow based on comments from staff it it suggests to me that they can at least tee up the key issues for us tomorrow and we could then review the draft and make recommendations to staff regarding anything where we thought they needed to do a little more digging um and again thanks to Miss Gilbert for raising these issues and it's another one of those Tom I'm looking at you where uh thinking more about our processes and Clarity and what information we provide to the applicant and the public it's it's something we need to think about so that would be my recommendation I don't know if we need emotion or what you would like uh I mean I'll defer to Mr Rowe I think you could make a motion and vote on",

whole concept and I think it's a great one and I think that our citizens will find it very important I feel that it will be a great way to get more people to attend neighborhood associations and and again open up all of the doors of the communications issues that we seem to have so I'm thinking it's a great thing I think we just need to postpone it and get more clarity and make a motion next time meeting thank you counselor for the discussion counselor Gwen oh I'll be I for one am super excited about doing this I think it like um like counselor nishioka said um you're before your time when it comes to stuff like this um I sort of feel like this is going to be the pilot project where going forward are other counselors can use this as a road map and if we spend five thousand dollars I I feel like it's five thousand dollars well spent because the roadmap is laid out then for everyone else to use the information and and that guide like you know so I'm fully in support I don't think we have to wait but yeah I'll try to be brief um I think it's a good start I'm just not prepared to vote for the original motion and I support the substitute motion at this time my hope and goal would be at the next meeting we could consider something that's like a two-piece Motion one for South Salem one for North Salem or something to that effect it would help me to hear from staff uh like you know does that just simply double the cost are there any unique um you know components to including um you know the different makeup of the two halves of the City of Salem I understand there are constraints like intuitively we have to limit this to probably four counselors at a time because otherwise if we go to Five we have a quorum so uh I just think this isn't you know as ideal as I hope the next thing that we consider could be I'm guessing that Council Varney has questions about that whole scenario but that's just me considering we're an eight yeah in West Salem that wasn't included in any anywhere in those equations but in my mind they're considered part of the north half they're not okay all right all right interesting I'm not sure that the folks in West Salem would agree with that but I hear you all right so can we I'm not sure that I remember what your substitute motion is counselor nishio could you repeat it for us so we make sure that we're all talking about the same thing from The Substitute motion to delay Council consideration of this item until August 14th okay further discussion or are we ready to will the recorder please call the role on the substitute motion councilor Nordike aye counselor Stapleton aye councilor nishioka I counselor Phillips councilor Gwen nay councilor Gonzalez absent counselor hoy I motion passes all right on to item 3.3 B counselor I um pulled this tonight mainly counselor I'm sorry we just need a motion first and then we can talk about it oh sorry um so I moved that we increase the navigation project funds from 5.2 to 5.3 million using existing state Grant funds moved by Gwen seconded by Phillips counselor team Russian so I I spoke with Sarah Webb today who is the behavioral specialist and I'm not exact she does everything she's amazing I talked to her at Great Lengths today and asked how many how many folks are are housed there now she said between 25 and 30 they're bringing and some of this is redundant we've heard it before um but I think it's important that we know what's happening there and that we're highlighting the navigation Center I'm very excited and I'm happy to say that I'm going to be volunteering there next week so um just to um and I don't know if that volunteering is the right word I'm going to Shadow them to just to get a feel for what's happening there so I'm very excited for that opportunity and yeah well thank you councilor I'm really really excited to hear that you're going to be shadowing over there I think that's going to be a great experience for you and thank you for pulling this and highlighting it because our navigation Center is really you know it's just getting started but I think it's going to be such a gem in our toolkit counselor Stapleton thank you so um yes thank you for pulling this um everybody here is so excited about the navigation Center and the good work that they're already doing and will continue to do um I just have a quick question on this uh for the city manager I know that we are doing an audit on our unhoused services that we're providing and I'm assuming that the navigation Center will be included in that and I just was wondering when should the council expect to hear back on that and then also how can we set it up so that council is getting regularly updated on successes or struggles that we are facing in the services that we are helping to fund here in the city lots of questions in there and I may need some help from Courtney to uh to finish the response but we have engaged with our Consulting team from Moss Adams to develop a scope of work for that evaluation of our homeless response system uh where I don't believe that we're actually engaged in that work at this point in time and here comes Courtney to rescue me good evening mayor council my name is Courtney Knox Bush and I work in the city manager's office and for your information we are getting ready to kick off that work and you would certainly be appraised when that does happen our intent is to finish the work in January of 24 so we would be moving at a rapid pace and be ready to present results at that time but you would be engaged in some of the stakeholder interviews and engagements and Courtney just to clarify do you anticipate the navigation Center being included at this point or would it be in an episode the subject is all of our grant funding and we do provide some grant funding yes thank you so much thank you to answer your question counselor and in regards to how do we maintain that stream I think both Courtney and I recognize the importance of this as a Communications priority and we definitely look for those opportunities to push this forward uh in our Communications channels whenever we can obviously the lack of resources there constrains that somewhat but both she and I are very aware of council's Interest year and also the interest that the community has so we are trying to put that front and center great thank you so much and yeah just to reiterate I think that council is really interested in getting regular updates on the successes and struggles that each of our different different services that we're providing are are experiencing not only to celebrate but also to fine-tune as we need to or however we can help as a council so when you do get to that space where you're ready to let us know how often that would be we I would love to kind of have a conversation about that thank you counselor for the discussion will the recorder please call the roll councilor Varney counselor Stapleton aye councilor aye councilor Phillips aye councilor Gwen aye councilor Gonzalez absent counselor Hoy I counselor Nordike aye mayor Hoy aye motion passes all right on to information reports we'll go through those one at a time uh does anybody have anything on item 6A I didn't see any hands oh oh wait maybe I did counselor Phillips for the purpose of highlighting uh can can please remind us or highlight for the community what is the equity Roundtable that we will be appointing a council liaison to uh thank you counselor so this is an appointment of a council liaison to the equity round table and I know that oh miss Anderson Ogilvy is sending us a Lifeline she's coming down to the microphone right now hi Lisa Anderson ogleby your planning administrator and I looked around and everyone else said um so uh the equity Roundtable will start as a pilot project with the the planning staff and Public Works staff um we used it specifically in the beginning to look at uh displacement measures as we're working on our climate friendly and Equitable communities rulemaking we're we're having to address displacement measures as one of the projects so Eunice Kim and Julie warnicky were leading it and they had four meetings so what they did is they reached out to all the different organizations underrepresented can organizations around the city that they've worked with primarily through our Salem and said this is our idea we want to do a round table what do you think and everyone said that sounds pretty good so so we had four meetings where we presented ideas we got feedback it was really is not intended to be a big public event but more of a detailed uh kind of working group on this project and in the last meeting we said we thought this worked really well and we would like to continue it on as we go through the transportation system plan and other projects City projects if the Roundtable agreed and they they do want to continue um and as we go through these other projects and but specifically they asked if they could have a counselor appointed they thought that would provide more assurance that the items that they're raising throughout this work are actually addressed and are carried forward by City staff so it will be used for other projects besides just planning your public works as we go forward thank you that was wonderful thank you counselor thank you Ms Anderson Oakley anything else on item 6A counselor Hoy just a question um Lisa or anybody is it displaced is that the word that's used yes and how does how is that defined displaced I could explain the concept but I see Ms Anderson will be coming back in case there's probably a more technical definition than I would offer um specifically in that in that project it required us to look at planning efforts that would cause people to either not afford to live there anymore or specific projects that actually maybe destroyed housing so if you think of like a freeway going through and it removed housing for example so we looked at what kind of projects is the city done in the past or what policies have we had that had caused displacement and then how could we mitigate that in the future and so you know we kind of have a technical background to look at that but we also wanted people's lived experiences what they thought",

well as the osu radiation center to participate on the rack and then we have a couple of unaffiliated members of the public with a lot of subject matter expertise um that have also expressed interest in david smith was the sighting division administrator here at the department for many years and has a background in radiation safety and also participated on the division 29 rack as have some of these other organizations uh and then dr wayne lee is a certified health physicist that has an extensive background working on radiological health issues here in oregon and elsewhere for a number of companies including portland general electric so that is our list here and i'll just to see if the council has any initial impressions or feedback on this list if you think anyone is missing or uh if you think anyone is included that maybe shouldn't anyone have any questions comments okay then christopher here none we can come back to this if needed but otherwise um to give you a quick idea of the timeline we are uh and we're not uh asking council to approve this or to adhere to this strictly but um we uh if the council initiates rulemaking today uh we would likely begin convening the iraq in the coming months so september or october um and that would extend through february i think we're anticipating the need for somewhere between three and six rack meetings as that process is wrapping up we'd be drafting our proposed rules and would hopefully be coming to the council with draft proposed rules and a draft notice of proposal making in april for your considering that the council is ready to go with proposed rules at that time there'd be the formal public comment and a potential rule making hearing as i mentioned before uh and that would allow the council to the adoption of permanent rules sometime in mid 2022 but hopefully by july so that's what we're looking at this is a little bit more of an extended process but we do think that that should be and unless there's any other questions i'll go ahead and turn this over to the council for deliberation we have split our request into two items for your decision uh first we're asking for your i guess the council's action to initiate the rulemaking and appoint the iraq and then we've um presented the uh issue of delegation of authority to appoint other rac members as a second item i'll leave that to the council to decide whether you want to address those separately or together well i think since you asked for it to be done separately that makes sense to me if no one has any objections to doing it separately then i think we should any objections carry none may i get an emote may i get a motion for the first item yeah um chair grill this is kent and that was a very well done presentation uh mr clark um so madam chair i move that the council initiate rulemaking to amend oar chapter 345 division 050 and implement senate bill 246 and appoint the individuals and organizations identified by the department to a rule making advisory committee to assist in the development of proposed rules thank you is hamley thank you hanley we have a second any yes indeed cindy condon quick question chris um i should have asked you this earlier is columbia i didn't see columbia river keeper on um the list of suggested rac members i know they testified thoughts on that council member condon we did reach out to columbia river keeper and see if they were interested and they let us know that they just did not have capacity to serve on the rack at this time okay thank you great question follow-up cindy thank you any further comments questions well this is this is hanley um madam what about is isn't it pge that had are they you know they're not they don't appear on your list councilmember jenkins uh yes uh pge uh did actually reach out and they'd express interest in participating in the rack um we did not include them in the recommendation uh partially because we think issues related to trojan are outside of the scope of this rulemaking um that is obviously uh the council's ultimate decision thank you for that any further comments mr secretary please call the roll mercy grail cindy condon kent hell jordan truitt perry choctoot hanley jenkins yes yes carries madam chair thank you sir um the second item the request for delegation of authority to appoint additional rac members is there anyone interested in making a yeah this is kent again and i'll move that the council approved the department's request for authorization to appoint additional individuals or organizations to the rack as needed the second half mrs hanley thank you any questions comments i would just like to say for the record i i know the public has made comments about us um as council not owning our responsibilities and i believe this is a perfect thing to delegate we're all well aware what the issue is and i don't think we should have to wait to convene to continue moving the process on so i just wanted to state that for the record um there's no other questions comments then we have a motion and a second so mr secretary please call the roll terry choctoo hanley jenkins yes marcy grail cindy condon kent howe jordan troy motion carries madam chair thank you um i just want to check in with everyone are you is everyone okay but i need a five minute break we still have a little bit more to do hey well we'll keep trucking on uh our next item is agenda item i application process review rulemaking this is an action item christopher clark odo rules coordinator or request counsel initiate the application process review a rulemaking project christopher the floor is yours thank you chair grill once again for the record this is required photo setting policy analyst and the council's rules coordinator and i thank you all for bearing with me hopefully i am not putting anyone to sleep yet so um during this agenda item we are asking that the council initiate phase one of our rulemaking to review and revise rules for the application review process which are primarily located in divisions 15 to 25 of oer chapter 345. um as i'll explain in a little more detail this phase is primarily intended to reorganize rules in a way that sets more boundaries between the procedural and substantive requirements that applicants the department and the council must meet and to clarify and simplify procedures for the review of site certificate applications where possible um i do want to note that while we have a general idea of the direction that we want to go with this phase of the we would really appreciate any additional feedback that the council has on the overall direction you want to go with the rules with your rules and the procedures for reviewing scientific applications the sequencing of rule making that we're in any specific areas that you think we should address either during this phase or during other phases of the role making uh while we're presenting here so um just to put that in your minds um similar to the last agenda item during this presentation i'll be giving some background on the origins of the project and then i'll give a quick rundown of our recommendations on the conductor proceedings including even authority for rulemaking objectives and scope potential impact on stakeholders our recommended methods of obtaining public input and we again have a brief timeline here to give you before we conclude and turn it over to you for deliberation so um this room leaking project has really been in the making uh quite some time uh as sarah presented a little bit earlier in her overview the financial assurance standard um the council's rules have gone through a number of overhauls uh generally those you know in the in response to major statutory changes so there was a big change in 93 and 95 and then uh another kind of cycle of rulemaking in uh 1999 and 2002 and then a little refresher in 2012 but there hasn't really been a comprehensive overview of the citing review process rules in some and uh we kind of wanted to center this rule making around making better connections between the and the information requirements that are required in division 21 specifically we'd also like to review those application review process procedures a little more carefully so um to give a little background on that so as sarah mentioned as well the council has adopted 14 general standards that are applicable to the sighting of all energy facilities in oregon and then there are a number of other specific standards that are applicable to the sighting of specific types of uh of types of facilities many of the general standards began as specific requirements for nuclear and thermal facilities kind of reflecting the council's predecessor the nuclear and thermal energy council but over time they've been made more general to reflect the transition to i think first the gas in the early 90s and now it's a renewable energy production as the those standards evolved the application requirements and the procedural rules also did but over time the relationship between those information requirements uh and the standards themselves have become a little less clear so we came to the council with a proposal to work on a multi-phase role making project to update clarify and simplify the procedural rules for the site certificate application review as part of your 2021-2023 rulemaking process or rulemaking schedule and the council approved us to begin our initial work the project was also identified in the department's implementation plan for executive order 2004 as a possible means to accelerate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by improving efficiencies and deciding the council is generally authorized to adopt standards and rules for the sighting of energy facilities and for the implementation of oregon's we want to know that the process for the application process or sorry the procedures for the application review process are generally described in rs 469 330 to 370. and while that really lays out the major milestones that need to be met and a lot of the",

        "text": " and what what scale are we working at i just wanted to share for the group that there's a couple things in the chat in case you weren't watching um there was a comment about using cdc social vulnerability index i provided a link to the ej screen in case you weren't familiar with it um brandi provided a link to the low-income energy affordability data tool so just wanted to make sure folks were seeing that and i know you have a question later rob about tools and this is about criteria but of course those sort of match up a little bit so it's more to fly back yeah and even within tools we have to how the tool is wielded and where the tool is identifying these criteria and that's where we get into these really quantifiable identifiable criteria that demonstrate that the money is going to the right community and that's where we have the opportunity to draw some lines and rule to make sure that we were serving the right communities and so yeah i think that gets right to the um i see phil you have your hand raised and mark um i see your hand is is up i don't know if that was from before if it's a new question but maybe we'll go to phil and then mark yeah these are these are some very useful categories i am wondering about the interaction between them so for example here in deschutes county we have you know much of deschutes county would could be considered rural but there are certainly parts of it people are for example experiencing lower incomes um in rural areas than than others um you know we we have uh we have some destination resort communities in deschutes county which would certainly be considered rural but um you know i i would not consider disadvantaged communities um so yeah so i i'm kind of wondering if if the way that you use these categories is if you um you know if you meet two of these criteria you're you know more of an ej community than than another um another community that just meets one of these criteria or whether yeah or whether we just sort of use this as a an initial filter do you check one of these boxes and if so then you can be considered as part of this category or not yeah um that really does start to get at a you can envision how points might start accruing in a competitive review process and i like what you said where you know each one of these could sort of be a check box with maybe different points associated with them and like you rural is not always ej and rural is not always low income or community of color and so breaking out the this list and really letting each of these individual contribute to the way that a project seems like a smart way to go about so yeah that's that's a good thought and um going back to les's question about what qualifies as a community that's another that's another good one i mean these projects by their very nature are going to be interconnected at a single point they have the ability to serve broad areas and in some rural cases they may be serving a really broad reach of folks or they may really have a neighborhood focus and so i wonder if any of the or committee members have thoughts on what kind of qualifies as a community well i i don't have an answer to that necessarily but i just you know i put in the chat when we talk about rural we it doesn't deal with this issue of communities so that that is a very good question that i think should be uh it's going to need to be figured out i don't have a good answer for it right now because but the yeah the statutory definition that just refers to a rural area so yeah i think with that that rural qualification that's one that seems to be pretty pretty well established in some other you know areas where we could reference that yeah and and you know how about coastal communities i mean is it within 20 miles of the coast or is communities that are you know there's is there a definition that oregon routinely uses to define a coastal see that ariana's got her hand up so um yeah this is a really interesting discussion to listen to and to participate in and i think raises some really important questions especially like what defines a community and i wonder about the tension in communities self-defining and having self-determination around like what is somebody's community and like what is a community as a more collective space versus having a state agency define what a community is like i like the idea of some points or criteria a kind of a you know it when you see it approach which may not be so satisfying from a government administration but i would worry about trying to define community too strongly in ways that wouldn't necessarily be representative of how communities think about themselves in terms of the rural and coastal i've been thinking a lot about like what what what is the nature of environmental justice and how does it relate to these and to me it has a lot to do with what is the impact i think i would hope that other folks could agree that fire impacted communities are very much environmental justice communities that fishery communities are very much environmental justice communities and i think in both cases there's a little bit of a resilience how is this community dependent on the land that surrounds it on the environment that it is a part of and what does that nature look like and how is it in being impacted by the impending and increasing climate crisis both from an adaptation perspective and an impact to the well-being of that so i don't know if that was at all helpful but that's kind of what i'm chewing on right now and trying to figure out how to allow for some nuance here without while also acknowledging the need for like administrative structure that's really helpful and i mean there's there's two things that are working with us as we create the program and one is we don't have to have a perfect on day one this program will continue to grow and improve over the next four and so leaving i like what you said about the definition of the community not not really necessarily needing to be defined within rules and that ultimately when we get to the point of reviewing these applications as they roll in um that we can let communities just exactly what they mean and having a hard definition within rule may work against us so i think that's um that's a good point i see that um shannon has her hand up and um phil your hand is up as well so maybe we'll go to shannon and then to phil uh thank you let's see i was going back um a couple of questions to the excellent question of what's the scope of the community and i'm wondering if you know depending on the size of the energy you know if it's a hospital that serves a bra if it's a county hospital for example then that footprint might be the county and if it's a um community center then that that footprint might be the footprint of the reservation and if it's you know it would kind of kind of depend if it was a low income then that the community would specifically be the residents of that housing in other words um in some cases the technology itself might help help to decide and maybe there are some suggestions or definitions of that that could be provided in the rules and getting back to what orianna very rightfully pointed out it's difficult to define communities from the outside and tell folks who they i wonder if there's kind of a a two-sided if in the rules we could create some known entities for example if if the community resides within an opportunity zone then maybe that's like a de facto okay you checked the lower clearly if you're a federally recognized tribe that's that's going to be easy coastal communities maybe it's between the coast range and the pacific ocean but that there's some kind of a qualifier or you know these are all clear if you can meet these you definitely can check those boxes or to leave it open for communities to demonstrate why they think they meet some of these and one of the other questions i have and i guess this is um to direct it to some of the other members on this committee is is there some work that's being done by our office resiliency and emergency preparedness i know i saw early on a pilot study that yume wang did from dogami that was looking at coastal and water supplies and you know what their likelihood of impacts from the seismic experience would have were and which bridges are going to go down but of getting to that um where is it limited infrastructure just wondering if some of that catastrophe risk exposure work that's coming out of other agencies might be generating some tools either now or down the road that might be helpful that's a really good thought and it seems like another sort of voice for maybe keeping that community definition open especially in early opening of the program and see see what we get rolling in so i see that phil's hand has gone down and quinn's hand has gone up and i apologize if i'm not doing these in it's always kind of a quick look back at the list and but that's that's a good even like you say shannon with the the coastal communities we could between the coast range and the coast and that would give us something in or maybe maybe it's necessary maybe it's not um to go into a hard definition around some of these specific call outs within that ej in the bill so um yeah i get i think we'll go to and then mike is up next yeah i actually it's mike's question in the chat about the eligibility of community-based or faith-based organizations i think triggered my question um you know looking at these questions i started going back and looking at um the bill and it's i find myself toggling back and forth throughout the meeting because there's so much in the bill that's already which on one hand is really nice because there's a structure but it's also sort of hard to figure out where the wiggle room is for the advisory committee um so looking at this and specific criteria i was thinking okay well who are the eligible entities because that could help determine what criteria would be in play um and i i noticed that i didn't wasn't aware of this beforehand that um you know non-profits are not eligible on their own so you know for me anyway helping you know understanding eligibility and what kind of entities can apply for these grants i think would hope in determining these kinds of criteria i mean in some ways the way it's defined in statute right now it lends itself on you know to more stricter",

        "text": "1st uh and then that really kicks off what we anticipate to be a pretty intense period over the summer and fall for us to engage with others with state agencies local governments Community organizations and tribes to identify those measures uh to include in Oregon's priority climate action plan and we're shooting for a draft of that prior to climate action plan to be available for public review and comment late this year sometime around November uh and our hope is to publish this earlier recall I said EPA has said this is due to them March 1st we'd like to get it out uh and near if not completely final form uh at the beginning of next year sometime in January uh because if you recall if you notice that the dates line up the the March 1st is the deadline for uh pcaps to be submitted but March 1st is also the timeline that EPA has indicated is on or around that time when they will open up that 30-day window and that's a very brief amount of time for organizations to apply for uh implementation grants and we'd like to give Oregon entities a head start give folks more time to realize what in their within their wheel houses is in Oregon's plan and potentially eligible to compete give that give them time to develop their applications um to submit to EPA in that brief 30-day window early next year um and so this brings me then to uh where we're at here in Oregon and our approach here Zach mentioned this earlier and I just really want to emphasize uh what I think tremendous starting point we're at here in Oregon to develop our priority climate action plans really ambitious schedule uh and I think many most if not Most states don't have that firm footing that we have here in Oregon thanks to the global warming commission and your work uh and chiefly to develop the recent roadmap to 2030 we think that is the obvious starting point for us to look to at the state level anyway uh what are the state uh priority climate actions um that the commission has identified and I would note that first and foremost among those and as uh at the EQ is the implementer of many existing climate mitigation programs I greatly appreciate the first and foremost the woman commission identified the need and the priority to fund and successfully Implement our existing programs here in Oregon and so I can I think I can say was with some confidence that that will be uh that we will look to those existing programs and their need for funding or benefit from funding uh to be some of those first and perhaps most obvious measures to include in Oregon's plan and um there are many other uh priorities identified in that roadmap and we'll be looking at all of them for any kind of relevance for federal funding and my relevance I really mean is there any kind of Nexus or benefit from receipt of federal funds for that particular uh measure uh and if so I think those are going to be that obvious starting point at the state level uh and uh we also know that uh it's going to be very important for us to engage with local governments and communities across and tribes across the state to identify specific measures for for them we want to have as many eligible potentially eligible measures in our plan um to compete for those funds and a lot of organizations uh that are going to be the entities with relevance for application aren't necessarily state government I'm putting aside again existing state programs uh a lot of local fleets for example school districts and Transit districts applying potentially for uh funds to for cleaner cleaner vehicles in their fleets those those organizations are going to be extraordinarily important for us to engage with and identify measures again so that they can later than next year compete for that competitive funding um I think go to the next slide at this point Janine if you don't mind I hand it over to you then to talk about that second deliverable I mentioned that EPA has identified the state's comprehensive climate action plans great thanks Colin and huge kudos to Colin um and his colleague Whitney for all of their work on this um climate pollution reduction Grant uh effort with EPA and the Oregon Department of energy is very pleased to be a partner in this work and we sort of took on designing a high level um work plan for the comprehensive climate action plan which is the second uh it's it's not tied to specific funding like the priority climate action plan is um the EPA says it should touch on all significant greenhouse gas sources and sinks and sectors present in a state or metropolitan area established near and long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and provide strategies and identify measures to achieve those so as both Zach and Colin said we're already far ahead here in Oregon due to the work of the global warming commission and others um and in putting together this work plan for this second piece we really did again try to leverage existing work like the road map and tie this into existing work streams acknowledging that we have a lot going on already so some of this will sound familiar um from the previous conversation on the legislative items that will affect our agencies and the global warming so the development of the Oregon comprehensive climate action plan or CCAP is divided into five work streams there's four here but the fifth one is pulling it all together um so the first one is the development of a Statewide energy strategy that identifies areas for improved alignment of energy policy regulation implementation Financial investment and technical assistance to achieve decarbonizations so for those existing programs that this commission has identified that we need to be successful in order to meet our goals the energy strategy will really look at how the state can better align its work to make sure those are successful to make sure we can get there and Beyond so specifically the energy strategy will develop a robust understanding of the energy sector climate emission reduction planning efforts already underway including through utility planning efforts identify challenges to successful implementation of existing policies and programs like HB 2021 and the climate Protection Program and then look to leverage identify where additional federal and state resources and actions can help support those we'll be working with interested parties in the public also to sort of weigh the relative trade-offs of the different options to achieve these goals a second work stream is a greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy Gap analysis of sources and sectors so this will look at the sources outside of the energy strategy sources not currently addressed by existing climate policies but also where existing policies may be insufficient to meet State targets this will inform the development of policy options and considerations to address those sources third will be a natural and working lands carbon sequestration inventory so this will start to sound familiar but this inventory will inform carbon sequestration opportunities on State and natural working lands including forests grasslands rangelands farmlands title and subtitle wetlands and the parks and Open Spaces in urban environments and this work stream will really take place in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in Oregon water and Watershed Enhancement Board and we'll be working to put together a biological carbon sequestration and storage inventory that looks at the total amount of carbon sequestered through biological processes and stored in Oregon's natural and working lands fourth then is a continuation of the community engagement that will take place under the priority climate action plan to really identify the barriers that are faced by Oregon's environmental justice communities to accessing and benefiting from clean energy projects and programs and to identify the greenhouse gas mitigation measures that are of most interest and benefit to those so this engagement and prioritization prioritization of environmental justice communities will also be critical to Oregon's implementation of many existing programs particularly the community climate Investments That DEQ is working on under the climate Protection Program and we anticipate that findings from this engagement can also be used to inform other state and local climate efforts as so finally then combining the output from these four work streams will comprise that final delivery deliverable to create an action plan that addresses emissions across all sectors and sources and at various levels of government so this will involve we acknowledge a lot of interagency coordination and decision making so we plan to be working with our sister agencies through the governor's natural resource cabinet and other venues and then the application we submitted to US EPA really calls out the Oregon global warming commission which will be asking to provide advice and guidance throughout the development of the CCAP the application highlights that our members the members of this commission represent a diversity of expertise and responsibilities across many of the sectors integral to the development of the CCAP um the work will also build on existing climate action plans and climate-focused policies and programs that many local Oregon governments have already developed or in the Pro are in the process of developing um also of course looking to work with local governments that don't have these explicit climate-focused plans or programs and we'll be conducting Outreach through existing Partnerships uh and then finally each of these work streams will involve significant Outreach and engagement hopefully in alignment with Outreach and engagement being done by state agencies and other entities that are implementing climate policies to make sure we don't overwhelm the folks that we're looking to work with and sorry that took me so long but that is our CCAP overview excellent thank you director Benner and Colin for your really thorough presentation on that it's uh really gratifying to see all this work that's going to be picking up kind of where the commission was able to get and deepening and expanding the way it can touch down in Oregon and making that more explicit so thank you very much we are um but now just a little bit uh more behind than we were before I'm going to suggest given that this is a three-hour meeting instead of a four-hour meeting as we've been having uh for much of the last year um that we can maybe shave down our our time for a break um and then possibly some of the work plan discussion time so with that I can't remember if we're going to a break now or we're going to natural and working lands and then to a natural working lands and then a break great thanks Zach um so if you um Lisa do you want to go ahead and share your screen or do you want to have Zach I'll go ahead and share okay great so Zach if you can take yours down and welcome Lisa um Lisa is the primary contractor to INR who's helping facilitate all the great work that INR is doing in particular the work of the advisory committee that is helping us with this work and she's going to give as I mentioned at the top of the of the meeting uh an overview or a",

ton of pictures Tom Tom has done a great job with being the photographic historian of the daily updates on on what's happening there uh right now ec electric today they just finished their work so at Del Web we have all 12 dispensers standing uh all of the power blocks which one power block uh controls two dispensers all of the power blocks are in they're wired to each other uh we have so the 10 buses will have 12 dispensers we'll have a couple spares and we've also installed infrastructure for another eight so in the future grants with the 20 bus order we'll have 20 dispensers and some some expansion right now what we're waiting for is uh kind of an land use approval that we we moved a little bit of construction to allow uh Salem electric to do some line boring from our current uh Transformer over to the wash bay to then power and and power the Transformer uh we're hoping that that process moves is going through uh the FTA and the state historic preservation office so just getting some approvals for for doing that work Salem Electric's ready to go the Transformer will be delivered tomorrow uh and other than that we're that's our our last step there uh I don't have a a real good date on when that will be completed because there is kind of a process that has to through depending on responses that we receive um I'm going to try I know the the last presentation I think some of these pictures you'd already seen um just the trenching going down the sidewalk all the the sidewalk one of the issues we ran into was that middle picture at the top with the storm water uh the the poure of that it was poured into place was was much bigger than what we thought so we had to relocate the storm system storm water system to allow for all the conduit to go through you can see in that bottom center picture runs and runs and runs of conduit and just more the vaults gone to the uh bottom left picture is the pads on where the switch gear go and then it just kind of keeps pluging along stop me if you see anything you have questions on that's in the bottom picture in the center is what one dispenser looks like so it's one dispenser per bus each bus you can uh plug it in on either the back left or the back back right and some more standing fresh concrete board and with that I I am available to answer anything I know the answerers okay I I every time that you come up I always look at director Navaro first to see if they have any questions thank you um I don't have any question questions but I do have a um this is awesome this is a lot of really awesome work um I'm really excited at the progress and how cohesive everybody has been working together um so this is really exciting and and I just want to say thank you for for all the hard work that you've put into this thank you it takes like I said it takes the support of everybody to make this happen from We're first having the direction to the grant applications to you know to where we're at now now it's it really takes everybody and it's it's exciting okay director Davidson just a comment that I I love the the look of the buses I love the signage the Meadow Green really pops um and I also am interested in uh if I'm if my assumption is correct that we also get some revenues from using this as a less polluting kind of vehicle I would again reiterate that I would love to see us be able to use that revenues to fund a feasibility study for micromobility in the next year so thank you director Carney thank you president in know host um so I I have reason for asking this question but it might seem maybe a little off the wall um as it's not about the color of the sign it's not about the color of the sign but um I have found that often when you have a hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle there really is a desire to provide the operator with a lot of information about how efficiently it's operating and and how far it's going and all that do these buses give us that kind of that kind of dashboard of information like miles since your last charge or you know like feat since your last stop things like that uh actually it does each of the buses come with a program called vericity that that will track kind of the kilowatt hours and and and what they're doing uh we actually had a call about it today so we've got three different webbased programs there'll be one for the inductive charging the induct EV charging there'll be one for the charge point Point charging one for diversity charging and we're working on kind of building a dashboard we're also looking at how we can pull data from our scheduling software to not only see what the bus is doing but see who's doing it uh and and you know we had a demonstration from tried a while ago where they were taking their blocks they were able to just automatically have it populate with the the operator of that route and then see what their efficiencies were and so you could capture the people that really successful and see how what are they doing and maybe have them as a training tool maybe working with the the people that are struggling to you know be in the green zone uh and then there's then there's uh lots of dashboard things that were were're trying to compile uh the you know Carbon emissions reductions you know what that what that means based on our utility rates so there's a lot of pieces that we're trying to make it for both the inter internal stakeholders external stakeholders and we can I think there's a lot of things that we can we should be publicly putting out the Forefront you know what what's happening with the district and and what our zero Mission goals mean right right right on um well one thing that came up earlier this week in our scats meeting was the like a South Salem Transit signal Improvement project and um in our conversation with the folks at the meeting we talked about um how the improvements in South Salem would give us the ability to potentially expand the pilot pro project that's happening on Lancaster for Transit signal priority um and I was thinking wow if we could if we could look and see and have that visible metric of how much more efficient our buses can be you know maybe it's in terms of how much more timely they are along the Route or where they where they save time or the fewer starts and stops that create the efficiency um and kind of visualize that and use that as a as a way to to demonstrate the success um and the you know the the need for expansion of the pilot or expansion of the project Citywide um so I just thought oh maybe there's going to be some kind of sparkly dashboard on this bus or a bunch of information that would lend itself to that cause so well D director car there's there's a couple pieces of that and what's what's really exciting is we don't know we don't know we don't right now uh but we're getting close to being able to prove what the buses can do and that's that's really going to be not only for Route 11 but we're going to be able to do validation testing we're going to see uh you know when the bus pulls into Kaiser and it sits for 10 minutes how much power does it get back you know what because the the whole idea we try to do is make a bus as a bus and it can go out and do its thing all day long we don't have to dead head midday charge do all of those things uh the data that we're going to be capturing in the next couple months with just testing that's going to be in conjunction with operative training and uh we'll be able to to solidify uh the planning department will be able to use that as they're planning future expansions because now we'll know what the bus is capable of we'll know what it can do instead of the back of a napkin sketching things out guess so we'll have some some data driven decisions which is yeah I really look forward to seeing some of the data great thank you director holr did you have a question yes thank you um so you've probably told me this before and I don't remember um the the charging points at Del Web are those level two or are those DC fast charging a great question that they're a DC fast charging so they're 200 kilowatt okay uh We've we right now we have a uh portable 50 KW charger and I'm just amazed how fast that charges the buses uh everything what we everything that we've tried to do because power is time and the faster we can charge buses the quicker to turn around trying to Future proof it you know there's there's lots this is what I'm so excited about trying to get the the data to see what it does uh you know I'm I'm thinking we could maybe get to the point where we only charge the bus is to 80% pull it off and charge the next round so you don't have to keep buying a charger per bus right so it's going to really give us some ideas and some directions on how we can work with the infrastructure the space constraints the budgetary constraints and still make everything is is uh fiscally responsible as we can so yes DC fast charging I guess is your is the answer to your question no thank you I appreciate that and I appreciate all the work that you and your and the staff have done and all the partners I mean it just sounds like it's a a fabulous effort and it's great I'm going to go down a road now that you may not be able to answer all my questions and that's okay uh maybe we don't even have any answers and that's so 10 buses here 20 buses or 20 buses total on the way with 10 coming on the",

        "text": " will be located so in this instance is within the City of Medford and Jackson County the governing bodies there are City of Memphis city council and Jefferson schners those two entities once appointed will play a very important role in this process we will give them a formal letter but do Outreach with them where they identify um requirements from their local zoning ordinance or development code and comprehensive plan that they believe applies to this project they can also provide interpretations uh findings of fact conclusions conditions that they would have applied that same criteria to a similar project and we would assume to use that and understand it so we can be consistent um and then we'll work with them throughout the entire process this is actually I think a lot of our favorite parts of the job to work with counties because they have positions that are the closest to what we do so they actually um generally what we're asking of them because they do it in their own daily life so next slide thanks so as Vice chairman Vice chair Hall mentioned we are here today to request Council appointment of these two entities City of Medford city council and Jackson County Board of Commissioners as the special Advisory Group groups for the proceedings of the application for site certificate which includes a notice of intent for the loan point to Whetstone transition line project and I believe the two options you have is whether you choose to appoint them in one single motion or in a combined motion and how the floor is worse and is there this is consulate virus they're a rationale for doing it as one Motion versus two is that where the jurisdictions convenience or does it matter I I would think there might be slight benefit of doing them separate just for the record sometimes the governing bodies change like we've had a County Court become a board of commissioner so if we can keep them separate it might be easier good that's weather-wise I don't know Vice chair how are you ready to entertain the motion oh yes I uh was hadn't unmuted and I was busy talking away there so anyway sorry um if there's if there's no further discussion then I'm I can't see you uh so somebody speak up and make a motion um one or a combination of one or uh separately for the city and the county Mississippi I'm happy to make a personal motion regarding the Jackson County um so sure how I moved it the council appointed the Jackson County Board of Commissioners as a special Advisory Group to advise the council in proceedings related to the review of the application certificate for a loan behind to Whetstone transmission line as presented and recommended by staff okay do we have a second sure how this is called Survivor our okay we've had a motion and it's been seconded so secretary Cornett could you please call the rules Ken how and buyer yes Richard Devlin yes very talk to Sydney Condon yes motion carries Mr Vice chair thank you okay um so we're ready for a second motion I'm this is Catherine remember Condon I'm happy to make a second motion regarding the City of Bedford chair I move that the council appoint the City of Medford city council as a special Advisory Group to advise and Counsel on the proceedings related to the review of the application for the site certificate for the loan applying to Whetstone transmission line as presented and recommended by staff second okay okay we've had a motion and a second by um councilor Devlin so let's see um so secretary Cornett do you want to call the role or am I here and that maybe somebody's wanting to say uh we didn't hear anything here Mr Vice chair oh okay I heard a few things come through but okay so uh secretary Cornett please call the roll

        "text": " the existence of the 2019 irp is helpful in the sense that it reflects a similar understanding it's more recent but you know as a technical matter once the 2017 irp came out and did what it needed to do that was the you know the the piece that needed to be in place in order for the lease cost plan rule be fulfilled exception of the issue that we're talking about here that stop b to h has raised which is you know the one thing that is really still within the council's purview here you know a a significant amount of this has you're relying on the puc's action but the council still is responsible for determining whether the capacity has been acknowledged by the um by the puc and that is a a conclusion that the council needs to make and so that's why our our issues here have focused on that uh that definition of capacity so sorry for the long-winded answer but this this issue is the complexity of this issue has mostly to do with the fact that there's a significant chunk of the lease cost plan rule that is dependent upon another body's action on the puc's action well so this is handling again that's i thought it was beneficial to include both 2017 and 2019 from the puc and um the language is uh company second amended 2019 irp uh i don't know if the rest of the council is interested in including that in the in the order the proposed order i think it makes sense this is kent where it went um just for it to show council for the record kalantardi weather what i'm pulling up here is this is um in the hearing officer's proposed contested case order this is appendix 2. this is the evidence that was entered into the record during the motion for summary determination phase so this over here lists and i believe miss rachner referenced the comments from puc so this is the information that is added into the record and so what council can do is you know update your facts now i would have to go and pull up those i'm not sure if these are the the comments in which the commissioners you know discussing acknowledgement of the 2019 irp or is it the actual order uh i'd have to go into the record and really find that um but could give direction to do that yeah if i may um because of the the way in which this was introduced as part of a motion for summary determination which it again gets a little technical but the evidence is being introduced for a very limited purpose um and that is to um you know essentially provide enough information for the hearing officer to decide whether or not this is whether there are material facts in dispute or not i think it's appropriate for the council what was offered and admitted for that limited to say simply that is part of the motion for summary determination briefing there were references made to the 2019 irp whatever those references are and and we can leave it to staff to um to sort that to make clear that the the council is the document that it's relying on um is the 2017 irp because that's that's the initial decision so if you know the irps happen every two years but if for some reason you know it didn't happen you know we have the 2017 irp that um is the initial decision that triggers compliance with the lease cost plan rule again provided that the council finds that that the capacity of the facility is what was acknowledged council member condon um just a question for you jesse if so we have the 2017 uh irp acknowledged here if if in 2019 the puc had not acknowledged it and the reason i ask is if there's a chance of that i think it is important that we state that it was acknowledged in 2019 most recent so you i guess what my recommendation is is when discussing the 2019 irp that there is a discussion of how that came to be in the um that it was a part of the motion for summary determination briefing and that the council can acknowledge that that was um is a part of the larger record um as a result of that um but and to i guess to answer the you know kind of underlying hypothetical that's in your question what would have if in 2019 the you know puc reverses course well we would have had a contested case issue about that you know i mean this this would have been a very different discussion so um you know the i again i think it's fine to acknowledge what came into the record as part of the you know the motion for summary determination um but i think it's also important to that that is the reason that was how that was introduced and that the you know in terms of the initial application that was filed the reliance was on the 2017 um application so really all that that is happening by reference to that 2019 is just the fact that they didn't change their mind um yeah so so this is hanley how do we do we can help with that um my suggestion is that if if you if the council's wish is to have a the the record the final order reflect that the 2019 irp is in the record that's something that i would suggest that i work with staff on to properly address as a technical matter because the the summary determination again it gets into some kind of wonky legal stuff and i want to i don't have any arguments with the summary determination and the hearings officer's order i think it needs to be in the proposed order the department's proposed order that we explain um that there is continuity yeah and so that's that would be my suggestion is that that staff and i can take a look at that and we'll come back with the draft final order handles that condon jenkins and i have all stated that we're supportive so i'm going to ask councillor truitt and buyer and choptuck are you on board with this same my name is perry choptoot and i'm on board thank you sorry this is jordan truitt and i am in agreement as well says counselor buyer i'm in agreement and i have some again not not actual language but sort of conceptual language so for the record todd cornett um so i can read this and then again i can look for head nods and do a roll call okay so what i have is agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the need standard not pertaining to issues in the contested case and in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issues n1 and n3 with the following modifications recognize the 2019 irp acknowledgment was brought into the contested case in the draft final order findings of fact and conclusions of law that works for the record kalantari weather i'm sorry to interrupt we're just we're looking at what was actually and we need to look a little bit further some information is embedded in footnotes but the 2019 irp itself the whole document doesn't appear to be submitted or the as a link so what we're what we're trying to provide council the the information so in 2017 not only did we have the irp but we had the puc order acknowledging it and so now and i think it very well may be because of the the timing of the irp process and when we got into the contested case we're trying to verify what was actually submitted do we have the irp do we have an order what we do know we have is kind of a summary of the commission's comments with which ms rachner noted but i think that that kind of isn't an what todd is summarizing and what you'd like to footnote update so i don't know if we want to pause i i kind of purposely tried to keep it generalized so it would allow us to fine-tune it later on um that being said is if council wants to have you know very clear language we can wait to figure that out right now or you can go with sort of the generalized we recognize that it's in the record we don't have the actual sort of reference or specific language for it but we will get that and as jesse said we work with jesse to make sure that the you know that the the findings and conclusions are written this is handling that works for me yeah okay i'm seeing enough head nods that council supports that okay so i will call the role on this jordan truitt henley jenkins yes kent howe cindy condon very chalk toot marcy gr sorry i got everybody did i get everybody empire yeah fire so oh yeah sorry it dropped over on a page and buyer sorry council member buyer thank you um again for the record todd cornett um just a procedural check-in um we were actually quite on time right now so we have at least a placeholder for a break from 9 20 to 9 30. council members want to take a break uh you can the next item is the public comment time period so we will sort of recess the the agenda item b move to agenda item c and then return sounds good we're on break then until um what shall we do 9 30. 10 15 whatever your let's do 9 20. okay we're back in order and we're continuing on with the next agenda item which is public comment do we have anyone in the room that wishes to provide public comment to the council that's good come on forward if there's anyone in the room that wishes to provide public i saw your hand first you might as well come up first yes thank you so just try to speak all right uh my name is norman simone i live here in la grande oregon and uh thanks i would like to thank the council for coming here for their thank you very much hi hanley i understand that the council are regulators working within the framework i would ask you now to start thinking that framework in the future uh it's going to change dramatically we should have started on this 20 years ago i think that's become abundantly clear to everyone given what we're now seeing with the kind of destructive changes in the climate regime across the planet the way this is now rolling is with the development finally of serious talk about a changing and uh now with the passage of the inflation reduction act what we have is an entire suite possibilities that will

        "text": " we are we've got so many comments covering a lot of topics just stop me if you have a question and let's just answer it um I can also I'm I am and for anybody watching online or listening on the telephone I'm running the presentation from my computer but um and what I usually do during our presentation is I'll leave the PowerPoint and we can pull up we can pull up the DPO the site certificate Maps we can we can look at stuff so I want to make make that clear so if you have have questions you want to clarify anything uh just just stop me and we will go there um so this is our procedural history um a couple notes on that at the hearing on the DPO there was a request um to extend the comment deadline because it wasn't evident we would be limiting the time uh in our notice so and again we always are trying to improve improve and be responsive so we're now in our notices for uh council meeting agendas we're going to provide a you know stipulation if there's going to be hearings that they may depending on how many people show up um there may be time Limited so that that's evident to people um so we did uh do a minor extension for that reason um and then uh the certificate holder had until June 3D and then they requested a few more or a couple more days and so their deadline to respond was um on June um okay what is rfa2 RFA 2 is kind of a big Amendment isn't it kind of got a lot going on there um however a lot of it is actually just kind of very similar to RFA 1 in that there the the the biggest part that we staff really look at are these additional route changes that they're adding in because the question is is do any of those are we impacting new resources do we need to change conditions do is there any um you know do these routes do all of them meet the standard because this is a new route and a new location and that is really what we hone in and look at however as we know Idaho Power is also requesting to expand the site boundary we're going to talk about that more we talked about it um you know we've talked about it quite a bit we talked about it and I set you up in advance of the hearing but we'll talk about it again um so expanding the site boundary and then adding new micro sighting area uh Alternatives within that area um IAH hope power is also uh proposing to in a midline capacitor station Union County or increasing the width of temporary construction roads and then um amending uh language of site so okay um I'm you know I'm kind of a dork I love the scope of council's review this is cool this is cool because I like anything that helps set us up to what is the question that you're asking well asking and answering so I I to me it's like when we make it clear like the to me it makes it clear what's the question here's the answer I'm going to come back to council scope of review um but uh and it's designated under o 375 so um so one because we're adding area to the site boundary which is you know it's that expanded site boundary and then those micro sighting areas we're asking ourselves do do those micro sighting areas and expanded site boundary you know meet the uh meet the council standards and we'll get into the nuances in between what require what we require to demonstrate those two areas later um and what this means is the standards applicable to an original site certificate that doesn't mean that we're opening up the whole original site certificate and looking at that previously approved facility that just means that like what are the rules on the books right now and those rules apply to those new areas that we're adding number two we're going to we're going to check in and see if the bond at or letter of credit if that amount is is adequate we still feel comfortable with that and then three we're asking ourselves and this an example of this is like with the midline capacitor station this is kind of a a new you know it's a different thing not looked at before um and so what we ask ourselves is you know the facility with that change like with the midline capacitor does it comply you know does it still comply with all of the standards and um okay okay uh so here's a list of folks that either in writing or in person or over the phone uh commented on the de on the r rfa2 DPO um thank you everybody for coming out it was awesome it was awesome we got a lot of comments and um it jazzes us jazzes us up because we want people to participate so I want to make it clear that I sent councel you know in advance of the May 30th hearing I sent you the comments that we had received and then we kind of got a last minute lots of them came in and I sent them to you in advance of the hearing not intending that you would be able to read or process them but just to ensure like you have them you have them so if you could pull them up um when somebody was providing testimony you could do that um and then uh Council also received uh the rest of the comments uh after the hearing and then um and then so we Council provide was provided all those and then when we issued our a staff report for this meeting we also provided all the comments again all bundled together with a table of contents um and then uh and then the certificate holders responses so on the certificate holders respon is it was a lot right there was a lot of pages there and I know that it's kind of overwhelming processing that amount of information um on our end I don't want to say that we're kind of used to it but we kind of we do have like this filtering process um so the certificate holder as as council's aware provided their responses um by commenter and then also grouped commenters that's like by topic and then um Miss Irene Gilbert also provided a uh uh you know a document of specific comments associated with site certificate conditions and they responded to each one of those so what we did in the staff report is we lifted the uh certificate holders responses by commenter and then we added a column and kind of provided our you know evaluation there um and everything is to kind of set us up for today I want to make it clear that that is not that's no decision that's not a recommendation it's kind of like and what we're what we're talking about today this is like we this is what we've looked at so far this is kind of where you know this is our initial response but we're going to continue evaluating these um into the proposed order uh and that'll be reflected in the proposed order which is the next step um and I'll talk about that more here in a little bit so man there was a lot that was covered uh up here you know these are kind of small I'm not you know I'm not going to talk about it I know it's small I'm not going to talk about this is just kind of a summary slide of what were our what were our topics and we really kind of um we hit we hit them all you know like there was a lot of uh issues raised now in our staff report to you councel and I also for the folks um you know listening from the public and particularly people who commented on the DPO we I really recommend I want folks to read the staff report um because then you see specific to like each comment what our what certificate holder and our responses are but we also kind of drafted it was like six big kind of big groupings of like uh responses to groupings of issues because these were like there was a lot of them but they're they were really blending a lot of them were blending what was previously approved with something that is specific to RFA 2 and so you know like and so what we were we're trying to do and kind of that's what I'm going to talk about in my presentation today is kind of responding to these kind of bi toopics um you know by like this kind of like big overarching response so um I'm not going to talk about everything on here we do say kind of where we're leaning or recommendations in the staff report and again on the the B2 Department web page I have a link to the staff report um so the the staff report is kind of an important document to process so um but if Council has specific question questions about any of these that are that I don't cover we can we can talk about them it's also we might kind of like Bumble along a little bit because you might have a question about a certain topic and it's going to be chances are it's halfway it's half related to kind of three different things which is we're kind of used to it with this project because a lot of issues kind of cross you know cross standards or blend topics so we do our best to kind of like put things away in buckets um not because not to be dismissive but because under council's process is we it we associate things with standards so that's what we're our process of of um processing the comments is trying to you know if it's not completely evident where a comment should live you know or be uh what standard It's associated with you know we try we try to do that um so and preparation of um the proposed order which we're kind of in that space right now um under Oar 3455 230 sub2 um it's what we call agency consultation in preparation of the proposed order um we coordinate with agencies um and so this is a list of folks that we are working with we got a comment from um Union County and from uh DSL Department of State lands and then we're still working and we got kind of a comment we're still working with Department of a and odf andw um which is kind of like clarifying some points or getting some feedback from them so we will continue to do that yes I saw um OD do was in there too um do OD do provided a comment okay they they provided a comment um so there'll be inter agency communication the the uh well we can talk about it we can talk about it today uh I mean I don't actually have a slide in the slide deck so we could talk about it now since we have the reviewing agency slides up it's a little",

        "text": " to raise an issue in a contested case proceeding the issue must be first within the jurisdiction of the it needs to be raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the record of the public comment period which uh unless discussed otherwise will be at the close of this hearing today may 22nd and it must be raised with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the applicant an adequate opportunity to respond um and to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that the support that support the person's position on the issue um so if we could go to the next slide so we'll probably put this back up the comment period after the applicant does their presentation but just so everyone's aware prior to testifying today or making your comment we need everyone to state the following your full name with the spelling of your name if you're with some sort of organization or group that you're representing please say the name of the organization or group if you are also representing an organization or organization or group please let us know your title with that uh and then finally a physical mailing or email address where the department can send notice information to you and as you can see on that slide if you don't want to provide your mailing or email address publicly you can email it to kathleen her emails up there as well as a phone number but you do need to provide that uh if we don't if the department doesn't get that they can't provide you then with any notice that you're allowed okay so i think at this point the applicant had um a short presentation they wanted to so kathleen is this the point we wanted to do it sorry my mic was not on that's okay all right so yes at this point it is capital power great thank you test test i think can you hear me great great thank you council members um hearing officer triana odo staff thank you for having us here tonight my name is matt martin with capital power on behalf of the applicant nolan hills wind llc i'm our director of business development been working on this project for for some time as we went over some of the dates earlier i'm pleased to present you a little bit more information about the project tonight give you some background on the applicant uh capital power in particular we'll go through a few slides i'll try to keep it quick so we can open it up for public comment so if we could get to the next slide yeah we're having a a technical issue we need to to update the correct slide deck okay stay tuned it'll only take a minute oh no no problem great thank you so as i mentioned um matt martin director of business development for capital power so capital power is a canadian-based independent power we are we own 27 different facilities across the us and canada more than 6 600 megawatts that we we operate across a variety of different technologies so we own coal natural gas as well as a large portfolio of wind and solar projects across the us and canada we've got over 800 employees and we are an investment grade company by s p as well as a publicly traded company up on the toronto stock exchange so i think you know the key takeaway that i wanted to provide for you on this slide is that we do have the financial wherewithal to build this project we we do own and operate our projects long term and um you know we have a fairly large market cap where we're on par in terms of size with portland general electric so while this will be our first project within oregon you know we do have a fairly substantial balance sheet and are able to to build this product ourselves next slide please so this slide didn't come out all too well since you can't see the background but if you can imagine some of those dots are all of our different facilities across north america and there's a big cluster north of the border in canada but i think the takeaway here is that we've got facilities all over the country both the u.s and canada um and the different colors are the different technologies when in solar so next slide please so this is a picture of the nolan hills site which we have been working on and the product's been in development for a long long time i think the first win lease for this project was signed in 2010 the first meteorological towers went up in 2011. we've owned the project since 2014 and been working on it for the last eight years so while the noi went in about five years ago the development on this site has been going on for a long long it was originally just a wind project we've since expanded it to be a win and solar project and so it's up to 600 megawatts with a variety of up to 340 megawatts of wind the 260 megawatts listed here of solar as well as a battery energy storage project that would be co-located with the storage so the project's about four miles south of as the crow flies ten miles west of pendleton as we found out today it takes about 45 minutes to get there but it's um it's it's it's very isolated south of the river and i think we mentioned earlier over 48 thousand acres of land as part of the project so we've been studying in a long long time we feel like we we have a good feel for the site and have cited everything appropriately next slide here's a here's a picture of the site again very small hard to see but the yellow dots are the 112 proposed wind turbine locations yellow shaded area is the nearly 1900 acres of where the solar facility will be there's a deep purple line that goes through the middle of the site that's actually a an overhead 230 kilovolt line that will connect our southern array of turbines to our northern array of turbines and so blue boxes on there so there's two project substations i believe it's about a seven mile line that connects the two and from there most of the turbines will be connected via underground collector cables and they will all funnel into that substation to the south or to the north depending upon which array it's at it's very hard to see in the light here but there's a pretty large swath of empty area in the middle of the site around alkali canyon so through a number of our avian studies as well as our washington ground squirrel studies we found um you know a very nice wildlife setting down there so we've set back our turbines and facilities uh from from alcoholic canyon i believe there's another slide later on we'll talk about the transmission lines so just real quick we mentioned a lot of this already up to 112 turbines the the tip height of the turbines is is under 500 feet and so that's kind of a rare in wind technology these days a lot of turbines are going bigger this project is going to be capped at 500 feet due to some radar concerns so we've signed commitments to to stay below 500 right now everything is based on a three megawatt turbine and um at the end of the day that the turbine technology changes over time and and you know we will be selecting it based on an optimal fit at a later date as we approach construction next slide so the solar component i mentioned it's a lot of numbers i think the key is it's up to 1900 acres it will be a tracking system which isn't listed here so it will be in north south facing arrays and it will track from east to west over the course of the day and it will be directly connected to the battery energy storage project such that it is the battery itself will be charged by the solar this is a picture of one of our operating facilities in north carolina next slide here's a picture of the best not a lot detail needed looks like a big sea can or box where the battery modules are are inside everything is self-contained and will be constructed in a large array on the site at that northern substation next slide this is a uh a picture of a facility kind of towards the end of operation um wind farm in in illinois provides a little context in terms of um you know we we permit or we apply for kind of the largest footprint you'll see about it that's a 10 acre site where our o m building and substation are substations on the bottom of the slide the operations buildings on the kind of upper left with the turbines in the background you can kind of see how when a product is temporarily disturbed versus when it ultimately you know everything gets restored so you can see kind of the the dark soil that's been kind of tilled back up and ultimately replanted but these are just a lot of stats in terms of what else is included in the application we can go to the next slide on the transmission side kathleen mentioned earlier but there are two different options one is a 25 mile line that for the most part follows an existing umatilla electric co-op uh right-of-way and so the the plan there and and there's a picture of a of a large high voltage line on the screen but the plan there would be to take the existing umatilla electric co-op lines which are generally distribution lines and replace the existing poles so you'd be staying on the same side of the road as the existing poles you'd put those distribution lines back kind of halfway up the pole and then our higher voltage lines would be at the top of the pole and so you there's some good examples of this throughout uec's territory it's been done for other the other option is a 230 kv line connected to the bonneville power administration stanfield substation which is a planned substation or proposed substation at the end of the day there there is a power line that goes through the site today that's 230 kv it's um the lagranta mcnary 230 kv line unfortunately that line is uh almost completely full and so we can't connect to those existing lines a new line is going to be constructed and so we've been having this project studied by bpa similar to the noi we first went back in in 2017 as a wind project we subsequently expanded it to the 600 megawatts and you and bpa has been studying it for the last five years we expect results in july the plan would be to build a a new substation at a 2b determined location",

        "text": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the public hearing for the adoption of the resolution for freedom crossings preserve phase one and phase two, municipal service benefit unit for general maintenance and capital improvements. If you will all please stand with me for the pledge of allegiance, such allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, everyone. And Madam Clerk, if we could please have roll call and proof of publication. Chairman Stone. Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Commissioner Curry. Here. Commissioner McLean. Here. Commissioner Zalick. I have proof of publication of display ad entitled Notice of Public Hearing for non ad Valorem assessments published in the Star Banner newspaper on May 22, 2024. Thank you so much. And Commissioner Bryant will be joining us shortly. She is in another meeting, and so I do expect she's on her way out right now. Perfect timing. Thank you so much. So with us today, we do have our director, our Ms. Tu director, Mister Chad Wicker. And Mister Wicker. I'm going to turn this public hearing over to you, madam Chair, if I can add a few things before we start the presentation. Yes. So for this public hearing this afternoon, we have three published the Greystone, which you mentioned. Then we have deer path, and then we have freedom crossing. Since we published those public hearings and we did send certified mailing to the residents in those subdivisions, we have been receiving a lot of complaints that they have not received the mailing at the same time. And you have received some of those emails? We have received emails that some of those subdivisions, they do have HOA in place. And the HOA, they have been collecting fees for the same purpose that we have included in our ordinance. So that by itself, will create a challenge how to navigate and how to overcome. In addition to that, today, I have heard, I have learned of some legal concern from our county attorney's office looking at all those issues that we have to overcome, and I didn't have a chance to have that discussion in detail and go back and revisit the land development code and to see what needs to be changed, if anything needs to be changed, and how do we need to modify our process going forward. With that said, so the board is aware of this whole discussion. You can go one public hearing at a time. And if you want to hear the presentation, we are prepared to give the presentation. And if you want to hear, if anybody wants to provide any comments. But at the end of the day, knowing what I know today, especially from the legal side, we may need to hold off on making a decision today, so we can come back to you in the future with some recommendation. So, and I don't know if Mister Minter has anything to add or not. Sure, Mister Mintere. No, I agree with that summary. I certainly agree that it's or recommend, not just agree, but recommend that we not take action on these today. That I think whenever you're dealing with anything related to assessments, it's important to make sure you cross your t's and dot your I's. So I think we need to do a little more review on this. Very good. But for the sake of people who showed up today for this public hearing, I would recommend that we go through the process and hear from them. Absolutely. I think that's important. We do have people in the audience who have come in here today, and I do believe it's important that we hear from them. I will still keep them separate, the three public hearings individually. We'll take them one by one. Will you need to make that explanation at the beginning of every one of the three public hearings that we're about to go through? I don't think that's necessary. Okay. Okay. So that one explanation will suffice for the three public hearings. That explanation relates to all three of them? That's correct, yes. Commissioner Zalick, if the county administrator is going to withdraw all three of these public hearings, why can't we just take public comment and bring it back in? So that the next time we publish this, we have. I mean, basically, we're withdrawing all these hearings. That's correct. We withdraw all the hearings, let the public make their comments, and then honestly, we're not going to have anything to talk about except to take comments until the next public hearings get agenda. So, in my opinion, I think we just have a motion to withdraw all three of these and hear from the public. I think that would be appropriate based on madam chair. With that, I'll move to withdraw all three public hearings today. So, moved or second motion by Commissioner Zalix, second by Commissioner Bryant. Any further discussion? All in favor indicate with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion will carry unanimously. So, for those of you that are just joining us, the three public hearings that were planned regarding the adoption of resolution for freedom crossing, excuse me, freedom crossings. Preserve phase one and two, municipal service benefit unit for general maintenance and capital improvements, as well as for deer Path north and Greystone Hills. Phase one and phase two. These three public hearings are not going to be heard today. They are going to be tabled to another time again, because we have received some information that mailings may not have been received by people who live in these communities, as well as we've been notified that the hoas are collecting fees that also match what this public hearing was to be concerning. So it will not be heard. But we do have people in the audience today, and I would like to open the mic for public comment. If there is anyone in the public who wants to speak to these matters, then I'm going to invite you forward in just one moment. Mister Wicker, good morning or good afternoon. I do have public comments here for Greystone Hill and Freedom Crossing preserve. If I can enter those into the record, please do so. Thank you. We've been made aware of those electronically, and now they will also be part of public record with our clerk of court. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Those that are in the audience, if you would like to speak to the board and share your comments, I'm going to invite you forward. It does not matter. Or maybe I should keep them together. So, is there anyone here on Freedom Crossings preserve, phase one and two that would like to make a public comment on that particular public hearing that has been withdrawn? If not, I'll move to Deerpath north municipal service benefit unit. Anyone for deerpath that is here that would like to make a public comment? Then I'll go to Greystone Hills, phase one, and phase two, and invite you forward to the microphone. And, sir, if you'll give us your name and address for the record. And then you'll see a set of lights come on and just pay attention to those as you see yellow. Just try to wrap up your comments. And I appreciate that. Anthony Delguardio from Greystone Hills. My address is 5077 Southwest 87th street. You'll just step a little closer to that, Mike. Thank you. Is it better now? Yes, sir. Thank you. Okay, so I can confirm what you said about the certified mail not coming to residence. I got mine a couple of days ago, and I was alerted to the hearing today. So I could definitely confirm that people weren't getting the certified mail. We did our best to try to get them out so that people would know what was going on, to see what they thought about it. But a lot of people didn't get it. But the people that did get it in my community were very much concerned, because our community does take care of micro repairing the pavement. We were also a little bit concerned because our pavement is brand new and we do the micro repairs. If it needs a pothole, if it needs some type of repair, we do repair it. We take care of our pool, we take care of our signage, we take care of the lawn care. We do everything. The community has been moving in the right direction the last three years. One thing that I noticed was when I got from Doctor Horton, our builder, our financials, my taxes were supposed to be 3500. Then I got a proposal from Marion county, and they were supposed to be four, but the actual taxes turned out to be 43. So it was a little bit more than I thought than I was going to pay initially. Now, with this non ad valorem tax added to it, it's kind of making things tight for me. And I'm just going to be honest with the board that, like, I'm struggling a little bit to afford the bills because my homeowners insurance doubled something that I didn't think was going to happen. I thought because I moved up north and central, I could avoid it and be in a non flood zone and get a. A good rate on home insurance, but it doubled. My car insurance also went up, and I pay a lot for food now, where I used to get better prices on things. I don't know. You go right ahead and finish your thoughts. Okay. But I just wanted to let you know that there are a lot of people in the community. I don't know why they didn't come today, because they were concerned. But I made my way here and I'm struggling, and a lot of people are struggling financially. And if you could take another look at it and maybe not add the taxes to it, it would help me out and a lot of other people that are in",

        "text": " fiduciary is weighted less than equity it just it doesn't doesn't seem quite right um however throwing the pass fail in there um we're just struggling with that so no more to say there just a general high-level statement that's really good feedback shannon thank you um yeah and obviously it's not going to do anybody any favors to have projects that are not um technically feasibly you know technically sound regardless of who the project is trying to serve we have to have rock solid projects in this program so that's a great comment thank you there's a uh several people have agreed and they're going to the comments as so general consensus to ensure that the um kind of technical feasibility and project plan either weighted equally to equity or potentially weighted higher than any other component and one thing in building this matrix we had a lot of items right out of the bill address equity and not a lot of items right out of the bill that really address this sort of technical feasibility and so we will work on this matrix as we go and we feel a lot more comfortable with our expertise within the agency to recognize the technically feasible projects and that the equity piece is the one where we've gotten a lot of support from this committee so here's how the equity stacks up one the community serves and this is essentially demonstrating that the project is providing benefits to a qualifying right out of the bill project leadership this too is one of the priority scoring items within the bill description of how the project leadership is is put and making sure that there's leadership involvement by representatives from the qualifying community partnership applicants demonstrates partnerships within the community outreach plan this is one that's not required in the bill but we thought could can we talk about a second sorry rob um randy asked if you could repeat something that you just said i'm not exactly sure randy might come off you and just say what topic it was that you wanted repeated there's something about prioritizing one section or one scoring over the other that i missed sorry i think it was just about the conversation about technical feasibility essentially it seems like people kind of want to do not pass go like if it's not technically feasible then the rest of it the rest of it matters less so either weighting it equally to equity or having it be more of a pass fail is what people seem to be interested in and ultimately each one of these line items kind of stands alone within the scoring matrix and that the total is worth keeping in mind for how each of these different kind of bodies criteria stack up and so we definitely got that message that the technical feasibility is of primary uh a comment i think from kwesha that just came in and let me see if we can pull that up i can read it to you rob great okay it seems like some of the items in the equity section could also be placed in the overall project planning section yeah okay well that's that's a good comment um and and some of these are again not items that are even required in the bill the community outreach plan is not one of those items that's listed in the bill um equity framework the framework itself is not a requirement but it's it's just a way to demonstrate that the project has these equity considerations in place really that equity framework presumably would include these last two elements which are project conducted in part or in whole by disadvantaged business enterprises emerging small businesses or minority women or disabled veteran owned and also include inclusive hiring hiring and promotion policies so really those could be within the framework and maybe the framework itself doesn't warrant additional points that that could be true of the outreach plan maybe these two don't have to have points associated so long as they're describing their community partnerships and the equity components of the project well any thoughts on that all right i will keep moving on and feel free to interrupt because i know i i miss some of the chat and things as i'm reading this so um so those are the equity components and those are derived largely from what is um described in the bill and then kind of taking it to that next level of um recognizing the value of having plans and frameworks in place direct project benefits and here's where we are recognizing priority scoring for energy resilience which again is right in the bill project will enhance community energy the potential change to community energy resilience of a structured facility that is essential to public welfare from a so this would be an opportunity for the reviewers to look at the energy resilience components of a project and decide how valuable they think that is to the local community and be able to apply 10 points across that one jenny hall has a question in the chat is oregon energy considering providing any guidance for what level of resilience is example is one hour of backup versus days or weeks etc guess we don't have at this point any minimum requirement but that's that's an idea and we could break this criteria out to try to help quantify you know if you've got um indefinite recharging battery storage and coupled solar that could run for weeks on a you know certain set of dedicated loads that's obviously higher value than one hour of of a backup or something like that so we could try to describe a little better how these get distributed across a resilient uh jenny followed up to say the state provides guidance that all oregonians need to be two weeks ready so that might be an interesting metric to consider and then also we could just make it clear that like the more resilience benefit the higher score on this on this so it'd be like a scale though just a few hours would be far less than longer than that perhaps and as a reminder to folks there's two pathways here there's a resilience pathway but there's also a just pure clean energy project pathway as well overall for the program shannon did i see you i strongly i strongly encourage maybe considering that there be just an additional overlay of meeting that two weeks ready um these were some of our technical comments as well resilience you know an hour of backup that doesn't do much good so you kind of got to get into the weeds and i love the concept of just taking state guidance for two weeks ready and making that a yes or no does your does your design support two weeks of energy independence for the identified critical loads or something like that with some additional points associated directly to that yep that's a great idea so um thanks jenny and shannon that's um great and then less in the chat is saying could you also reference local energy plans adopted by sorry a new chat came in adopted by local governments on top of the natural hazard mitigation plan so sorry that got interrupted could you also reference local energy plans adopted by local governments on top of the natural hazard mitigation plan yeah that sounds like a great idea and especially when we're thinking about um communities with kind of different level of planning prowess and background in energy resilience if we can recognize efforts that are not the natural hazard mitigation plans but recognize some level of planning for energy resilience that sounds good great and then randy martin followed up i think in response to shannon's concept which was resilience extends beyond backup power if metrics for backup power are included what about other benefits that might just be food for thought for and then um alessandra wonders if jenny could share the state guidance that jenny referenced on resilience so if you have that that'd be great jenny otherwise we can track it down and follow up yep we could we could get that into the chat or follow up after the meeting or if jenny's got it handy i'm throwing in a link into the chat but yeah that sounds great and i would say with this with these resilience we will reach out to some of you individually after this meeting um jenny and shannon you had some some great feedback and and also having kind of the relationship with local and and the fema work so maybe stan and you know i think we could use a little bit of help on this one and brandy too if you have thoughts on how the kind of the federal piece lines up with this so that would be very helpful within the criteria for the hazard mitigation plans that one comes directly out of the bill and is recognized in the bill as a component for essentially earning you know points or priority scoring and so maybe we would have that one in addition to some other description of of local planning um so that we are honoring the bill's intent to to get those natural hazard mitigation plans recognized all right well that's helpful um we have a little bit on project diversity but i i wanted to jump in really quickly and there was discussion christie brought up the fact that there are projects that will be straight renewable energy projects that might not have any equity component and might not have any energy resilience you know those projects theoretically could take up to 50 percent of the project of the program funds and so we want to have scoring that is obviously heavily weighting the projects that have the equity and the energy resilience but we also want to keep in mind the straight energy project and i think the only time that really is going to become an issue is if we have highly competitive rounds where we have a lot of projects to choose from and then it makes sense for us to be steering the funds to the projects that have the that are supporting the qualifying communities and have the energy resilience component so i think it's going to work out anyway but we should just continue to recognize that we have you know we have these projects that may not be checking a lot of boxes that are still eligible within the program and i see that we're down to a little over 20 minutes so the next one has a lot of overlap with this one so we should be able to move fairly quickly uh quesa see your hand up rob i have a question as as we're thinking about not only the benefits and it's kind of take me back to the project technical feasibility all of it is there because i don't remember in the draft rules is there a are there requirements for or a plan on how you sustain the equipment the how how how it's going to sustain over time and is there a requirement for any plan around that because i mean you can see projects get built and not be maintained appropriately so i'm just wondering and maybe i missed something yeah that's a great question and the describes projects operating for a minimum of five years and we've addressed this in our roles um some we do have a a clawback provision for projects that",

        "text": " disgruntled homeowners because of the disparagement and the harassment that was going on with the board members. So it was a lot of work that went into it to try to get everybody on board with what we were planning, and we ended up getting that approval. So from a community interest point of view, I think what we've accomplished really served the community. And with 70% of the homeowners approving and having some people oppose, of course, that was kind of a natural thing anytime you propose anything. So even though I'm sure you'll hear some opposition, we went and explained tick by tick, point by point, whatever point was made, what was actually being proposed. And the real proposal here is to take the 22 acres that were there. That was all weed infested, overgrown cart paths were usable. They're all cracked with weeds and so on, and take 20 acres and maintain it as community open space and leave the 1.7 acres to David to develop homes along the street. And that looked like a pretty fair trade, I'll say, because we didn't pay anything for that quick claim, deeded it over, and so the community got control of the space. And in exchange for that, we would approve or at least accept rezoning if it was possible. So he already upheld his end of the bargain, didding over 20 acres. And now it's just the last step here of getting this year resound and still certainly in full support of that. Is there anyone else like the speaker in favor? Yes, sir. My name is James Haeckel. I live at 176 777 Southeast 120th Terrace in Summerfield. I'm not going to add a whole lot to, you know, you don't want to hear the whole story over again. I just want to say that my wife and I moved there 20 years ago. Our property value has doubled, almost doubled in that time. But there was that time when six or seven years ago, it looked like it was going to go on. It was going to go flat or less than that. We don't live on the golf course, but that whole community is affected by what that, what that area looks like. This is a time when David has fulfilled his part by giving us that property, and now it's time for him to get those five acres or those five homes, that 1.7 acres. And I would appreciate if you all would adhere to what 1560 families out of 2300 or 2200 have requested be done. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Anyone else in speaking favor? My name is Roger Nayalas. I live at 1707 five Southeast 108th Terrace in summer Field in Stonecrest. Just two points I want to make, and that is, I was one of the real motivators in getting this job done, along with Jim and Jim and several other people. One of the issues that got raised during the process, Washington how are we going to maintain it and how are we going to pay for the maintaining of that? Well, it was a very simple answer. When David gets his five homes on that property, we get amenity fees from those, and from those five homes. It's approximately $9,000 a year that the community picks up and helps pay for the maintenance of that property. And that was a concern to the residents, and that was one way to offset that. One other big thing is in our community, we have 21 miles of roads and we have, we don't have any sidewalks and we have a few old people that live there, and they walk. I mean, they walk morning and they walk nights, and the only place they can walk is on the roadways because we don't have any sidewalks at all. Taking this property over, fixing it up, fixing those walking trails up, gives them an opportunity to get off the streets and walk out there. And it's been a big boon for those folks. They love it. So we need to live up to our part of the bargain and help David get this rezoned, and it'll be a good thing for everybody in that community. Thank you very much. Thank you. Does anyone else would like to speak in favor? Before we call up anyone that wants to speak in opposition, I'd like to, just for myself, clear things up. We had an agreement, and, or we're going to say 70% agree to this back a number of years ago. Now we have the opposition from however many that's trying to stop that from happening. Is that basically, in a nutshell, what we've got? I would say that there are people that they did not have 100% support for their proposals. Right. So these are probably some of those people. Okay. Hey, Chris, when this was brought up the last time, it was denied. It was denied by the board of county commissioners. One of the concerns, too, was that Mister Black was not in attendance at that meeting. Mister who? Mister Black, who represents on golf, was not in attendance at the meeting. Okay. And so as the commission considered the request, ultimately just moved to deny it in that respect. Okay. I think. Do we have a record of what this board did? I believe at the time you recommended approval at that time. That's what I thought. That's why I asked what happened at the county, because I know we approved it. Yeah. All right, let me ask, is Mister Black going to attend the commission meeting this time? He's been advised of it, in fact, actually, for this meeting, just for one more time. This meeting will be April 17, which is a Wednesday for the board of county commissioners at 01:00 p.m. it'll be the second meeting. It'll be the second meeting of. So you won't miss the next one. Okay. It's a terrible thing, but, you know, it's tough because we've. We've gone through that with applicants not being here, and we just, you know, we're going to start seeing a lot more of this. Golf has kind of fallen out of favor, and we're going to see a lot more of this. And I. I hear about it going on in places all around Florida where, let's hope our area doesn't, we keep the golf courses. Yeah. All right. Anyone that would like to speak in opposition, you're welcome to come right on up. If there's a number of you guys, and I trust that everybody did raise their hand and to get sworn in and just come up and make a line and as do you want to use two podiums. Or we can do that. We can use. You all hear me over there, you guys that are walking down, we can take some on this side also. And what we'll do is as one person speaking, the person on the opposite podium, go ahead and write your name. Write your name and address so we can move this right through. And I'm going to take the gentleman on the right who has started to write down he should be about done and we'll go back and forth. So when this gentleman leaves, we'll ask the next one. Follow him. You guys go ahead and write your name down before you speak. Sound good? We'll get it going and kind of late for a lot of us for dinner, but get home in here, lord willing, anyway. Yeah, you can. There you go. Good deal. And you'll tell us your name and address and we'll hear from you first. Yes. My name is James Clark. My address is 170 414 southeast 123rd tariffs in Summerfield, Florida 34491. Okay, I appreciate the time. I bought my house in 2006. I've lived there 18 years. The only thing I have from my screen porch to the pool area is open area. There's no obstructions whatsoever. To the south of me where he wants to build four houses. Over there I could see for a quarter of a mile the house he wants to put behind me between my house, lot 80 and the pool area is going to obstruct my view to the west. And he's also obstructed my view to the south. Now I've been there 18 years, never had a problem. I spent good money on my home. My brothers and sisters live in the same development and we are all opposed to the housing that he wants to build, especially the house between me and the pool area. That's all I've got to say. Very good. Thank you. Hi, my name is Marianne Scully Zushik. I live at Southeast 123rd Avenue. I'm Jim's neighbor and we're new. We just moved in in December. I had no clue any zoning issues were going on with the house. And we're very upset. The fun that he's going to put a house, we're going to be looking at a wall directly behind our yard. We enjoy the view we bought for that reason. We would have never bought in that development had we known now. May I ask, were you made aware of the decision that your homeowners association made a couple years ago? No, we had no clue until after we moved in. Wow. And I'm very upset. I'm very upset. It's something we should have been aware of. And we had no clue somebody was going to put a wall behind our house. The view is gorgeous. That's one of the main reasons we bought that house. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, sir. Take it to Miss Sage and she'll make sure we get our picture. My name is Larry Stover Hardy. I've lived for 16 years in stonecrest. What's your address at 17 five. 8819 circle. I'm one of the people that got a nasty letter from the",

        "text": " required to to do the desktop analysis for all of these so as you can see there's 20 mile study area for areas things like the the cultural tend to be limited to the actual site boundary and I'll get to the site b in a minute um fish and wildlife has a half mile endangered species is five miles and one of the things that we're looking for input on at the noi phase whether it's a reviewing agency or the public is what you pick up what should the analysis areas be often times they're the same as this but they can also change so if you think that the analysis area should be doesn't need to be that big or it should be bigger this is a really important part of our process particularly with our reviewing agencies of getting that input on you know does this make SS does it need to be bigger there something we're not seeing here and it's just at the noi comment phase this is one of the things that we're really trying to uh dial in because in the app in the project order that I prepare I'm going to identify the required analysis areas for the application and they may be the same slightly mod different so if you have thoughts or concerns about potential impacts of a project to these resources then please be sure to put those in their comments and what you think those analysis areas be and then just land use is a complicated topic but just so you know the state sighting process is what we call a Consolidated review and it pulls in all most of the permits and requirements from local governments and state agencies that would other that would otherwise apply through those different it's it's to simplify the permitting process so the requirements are still there but it runs through one process of review and that's why we call it Consolidated review for land use the applicant has an option to have the land use review being conducted by the local government or to have it in the Consolidated State review um I believe in the notice of applicate has indicated that the local land use requirements for Wasco and Sherman counties they're going to opt in to utilizing the Consolidated State review process the can choose to do the local review but at the time they submit their application they have to lock it in they can't change their mind later if they say they wanted to do local review or state Consolidated in the application right now you know they they're not locked in but once they put in the application they can't change it so just a really quick next slide I'm trying sorry the proposed facility location is that black outline um and just to give you an idea of where it is what's in proximity and like I said it's approximately 12 6 square miles of private land and from what I understand the only portion of the facility that would actually extend into Sherman County is that transmission line should it move in there because it's right up against the that's correct where the site facility is not is is purely within Wasco one of the proposed interconnection points um is that line you see extending North that doeser count and that's an option they have it one of two options yes so just next slide very simply and this is just a really Brie overview of what's in the notice of in P so what is this facility it's a proposed 800 megawatt solar photo voltaic energy generation facility with related or supporting facilities that include up to 800 megawatts of battery storage um a 34.5 collection system a collector substation an onm building and overhead 500 KV gen thain fencing Access Road staging areas and as Jeff had noted they're looking at two options for what we call a point of interconnection or a POI one would be directly adjacent to the facility the other option is if they had to go north about 4.5 miles to connect with a different uh BPA subject next slide so I just wanted this is not the public comment period of this meeting but I wanted to talk a little bit about the public comment period on this notice of the H as I had mentioned the public comment period opened the day we issued the notice on October 10th and it will be open until December 1st there are multiple ways to provide comment you we have a comment portal you can email me it's all in the public notice there's a copy of the table back there if you haven't received one um and it's really like I said opportunity you can email me you can Su them snail mail we take comments tonight these will all become part of of the comments that we include in the project order that I'm going to preparing um as I noted before it's not a public hearing the public hearing comes after we issue a draft proposed order and it's not required to comment if you wish to participate in a contested case at a later stage um and we'll open it up for Q&amp;A in public comment after Jeff has an opportunity to provide his uh his presentation next slide this is also information that's on the public notice that this is my contact information my email my phone number please feel free to com contact me if you have any questions or any comments that you want to provide to the Department of energy as we move through process um and then the next slide we have an amazing web resource web based resource great web page um this slide is really just to show you that there are several um places in the Oregon Department of energy energy facility sighting Council website where you can get all sorts of information we have a project web page set up for this facility we will update that project page as things move along um there are ways to submit comments through the internet and our comment portal any comments that we receive get uploaded to what we call our site docket so people can review and see what's been provided we have a very public process we have a public guide on how to participate in our process we have hand notes on that back table that also you can take with you that outline our process and how it works and what our standards are and where we're at in our process and there's some good links down there at the bottom of that page and so like I said I just really wanted to thank everybody here in the room in particular and anybody that's participating on online for participating in our meeting and at this point I am going to turn it over to Jeff who will talk about the facilities you're you're you're okay okay um thank you anyone for anyone who just walked in or just joined online again my name is Jeff Watson uh development manager Sav On energy and lead developer on this project uh going to keep things brief want to give everyone some time to make sure their questions and comments are heard and answered um so just gonna quickly give an overview of Savon as a company and then the pro so Savon uh is we are a us-based developer for renewable whether that be solar PB uh storage or wind based out of Kansas City Missouri um operating in 33 Excuse Me 3 three states across the US um Savon is a portfolio company of and wholly owned by shell energy um Savon effectively functions as shells um Renewables are in the United States so while we are owned by shell we do operate as our our own entity um and the benefit there is that we get to utilize any sort of connections or existing um shell may have in Renewables energy Etc uh while still you know pursuing our own um development efforts on their behalf uh and next slide please so just to give an overview of our um you know sort of experience in the in the industry I know that's a lot of numbers up there uh but over on the left we have you know about 2.5 to upwards of three U gws of projects that are contracted so you know have a contract to sell energy uh under construction or in operation um we are also develop have a significant solar and energy development portfolios um again across 27 States so one thing I will mention is that um you know Savon is a new er entry to the Pacific Northwest um that being said uh I feel like at this point we have a very good fo hold in um you know Oregon Washington even Idaho and shell as a company has a significant investment in Washington so we at Savon we have a local team here um across the the Western Seaboard and shell has a pretty significant presence in Washington with a trading desk um and other other teams based out of Spokane uh and because of that investment in the Pacific Northwest particularly within BPA which this project is interconnecting into um there's been a lot of ways that you know I guess all that is to say is that you know we have a bested interest in in succeeding in this part of the country and and are very much here to here to stay and next slide please so that's a bit about Savon um and so I just wanted to give you an overview of the project and I know that Kate already went through this so I'll just try to you know walk through this quickly so we are 800 megaw of solar PB uh that is going to be developed and constructed in phases so divided into half so two think of it as two 400 megawatt projects divided up into phases um this may include up to 800 megawatts of battery energy storage uh that number is yet to be fully determined as BPA does provide us some flexibility there um but at most it would be a one: one ratio of solar panels to battery storage uh as I mentioned that it's on the BP uh excuse me the BPA uh system our Pro so BPA allows us to choose two pois or point of interconnections our first is along the bucket of grizzly 500 KB line number two which is directly adjacent to the project uh we would effectively be what's called tapping the line or constructing a new substation on site uh and having our point of interconnection be on site with the project the other option we are exploring is running about a 4 and a half mile Genai North into Buckley substation in Sherman County um this is something that is not yet it is something we're looking at it's something that we're doing our diligence on uh it's not something we fully yet secured um so we'll continue to look at this as an option uh but for now we do have an initial uh point of interconnection secured at uh the and then quickly just on permitting",

so the next one has a lot of overlap with this one so we should be able to move fairly quickly uh quesa see your hand up rob i have a question as as we're thinking about not only the benefits and it's kind of take me back to the project technical feasibility all of it is there because i don't remember in the draft rules is there a are there requirements for or a plan on how you sustain the equipment the how how how it's going to sustain over time and is there a requirement for any plan around that because i mean you can see projects get built and not be maintained appropriately so i'm just wondering and maybe i missed something yeah that's a great question and the describes projects operating for a minimum of five years and we've addressed this in our roles um some we do have a a clawback provision for projects that fail before the period that's described in that performance agreement that we'll have as part of a grant so we've got it somewhat covered with rules and performance agreements but the basically just describes five years and we're hoping we get a lot more than that out of them gotcha okay thank you for that just a and rob before you move on to project diversity um we did have a couple of more comments related to resilience um brandi um just wanted to say that it may be more complex to define but thinks that project benefits to the community should definitely be included and then also dan orzak thanks for joining us today dan um mentions that resilience varies between sites few projects can afford two weeks of running entirely off grid in the winter on solar and batteries without additional power sources such as fossil fuel generators also resilience requirements for a small office building for example will be far different than for a wastewater treatment center running a wastewater treatment center entirely of solar and batteries would likely cause multiple millions of dollars so um and then um shannon wrote back to that so there's a little conversation in the chat on that but julie noted rob if you have anything you want to add i just want to make sure everyone heard that yeah great comments all right with the geographic diversity we've we've laid out a way to kind of parse out the 10 points in a little more formulaic fashion if the project is the only one in the opportunity announcement from a region and we haven't defined exactly what the is yet we've talked a little bit about regional solutions there's county lines there are different ways to define a region this one says as outlined by business oregon they have economic development regions but if if other projects have come from the same region but is the only one in the county we apply some number of points if there's more than one project from the region you know basically we want to just make sure that these funds are distributed with a nice geographic diversity across the state i think since we have limited time and an opportunity to comment um after you know after this meeting we don't need to get into the weeds with this sort of scoring matrix but um i just take thoughts on that i'm gonna check in on our agenda real quick mrs shannon again i apologize for talking too much but the geographic diversity i i appreciate that approach um like from ocean standpoint when we think about geographic diversity our intent is to be looking at a community's level of energy isolation we were looking for points that could uh you know the level of remoteness from generation systems maybe substation reliability metrics or proximity to major transmission lines so that geographic diversity with respect to our electricity grid to look for some potential for projects to have higher points for energy islanded communities which would you know in some cases might actually the way that the geographic diversity is defined as presented might actually discourage multiple projects from going forward in those regions that really need them the most because they are so yeah that is a really excellent thought shannon and i think maybe we need to think a little bit more about that and i think that's one area where this program is kind of unique in that it's able to reach out and fund projects in these very small rural communities and provide up to 100 funding and it doesn't have to be a gigantic microgrid project to qualify i i think that like you like you put it shannon we need to figure out a way to to recognize when a community is really needing projects like this and especially what we've seen in the last 10 years with storms and wildfires and you know there are certain communities that can really benefit so great thought thank you shannon i had a request that someone sort of summarized the question or the point that shannon made in the chat that they didn't catch everything she was talking i don't know if you want to give that a try rob um within the i just look in the chat thank you so much shannon did that take care of that request yeah i think i was just a little behind in the chat i guess um well there was another question will odo adopt concepts of energy sheds during this period i t may help with geographic diversity context or it may help with geographic diversity context you know um some of this is related to the document that's last on our agenda which is the community resources one of the ideas about the re resources that we make available is that it can communities to distinguish themselves as needing these and so there is a little overlap there and i i don't know how much we're going to be able to dig into that resources project i know we have limited time and i really like this discussion on energy resilience but yeah i mean there are there's so many different ways for um projects to demonstrate kind of that they are the right spot for these projects we want to make sure we've got those covered both in the scoring and in our resources so there's a way to to demonstrate that and part of what we're talking about is is inherent within the definition of qualifying communities which we we all know is very broad but it does focus on rural communities with limited infrastructure traditionally underserved and so maybe there's a way to divide up the qualifying communities component to either we we really define it well within the matrix or we put the points in and we let the the competitive review committee ponder it when there's actual projects to look at and we put together a committee that's able to recognize um the value of projects in these communities so i think one thing we need to recognize is that in our first release of this program we're going to have a scoring matrix that that can definitely be changed over time as we learn from the program and that we will we also want to give the reviewers some flexibility to consider things as we as we go through this so all right um so the matrix for development projects is very similar to the one we just saw for planning and this one we had actually beefed up the number of points associated with the project plan because for construction projects technical feasibility is even more and obviously planning projects you don't know all of the the technic or the feasibility study has not yet been completed but with a construction project we recognize that that project plan is critical and that the technical feasibility is um you know first and foremost um within thing but i think we'll we'll take all of the comments and also enhance the value of the technical feasibility in this section as well but this is similar where we have technical feasibility of the proposal being a pass fail but also bringing points into the but anything that scores zero and this is um if they score zero here it's it's a fail and and there won't be the ability to rack up points in any of the other this is it largely follows what we had just seen i think that given the amount of time that we have left i may just transition over to the community resources document to share a few thoughts on that um and then let let the committee members take these documents and noodle on them up until february 11th and share thoughts so any other comments right now on the competitive all right i'm going to open up the resources document so here we have document that essentially consists of a lot of the ideas that we've had from staff and stakeholders leading up to today for resources that can be used and just as a as a little prelude what we're looking for is not necessarily a list of 100 but a list of 10 resources that are really useful for a community to be able to go in and say oh this is how i can demonstrate that i'm truly rural or that i'm truly this or that and with a simple way to demonstrate criteria that they're trying to demonstrate so that's really what we're trying to get and we have resources that are associated with demographic data associated with um your you know how far you are from resources or or critical so keeping that in mind i think we'll we'll screw scroll through this and this is another one where we would love to get ideas for additional resources but also thoughts from the committee who may have experience with some of these to say no that's way too confusing don't put that out there or that's really not going to be useful um that's not going to be useful for for community groups or municipalities or whatever so here's our list ej screen that's a tool that we've had a few discussions u.s census data and i know that this is it's a resource but it's a it can be a tough one for folks to access if they're not used to kind of big sprawling data sets and you know in there far the frontier and remote area codes um usda it's kind of how rural are you and it's a they include a map of oregon and um for oregon especially eastern oregon a lot of eastern oregon is um is designated as a extremely remote so it is a good tool for demonstrating if your community fits within one of the the far regions especially those that are very remote that that one's potentially enterprise zones oregon business development department has established these enterprise zones um which are you know these economic development regions um oem office of emergency management has resources and again the idea is just to throw all these out there and try to come up with a list of materials that are truly the cdc social vulnerability index this is one that i think might fit in the category of something that's",

        "text": " real time so I would love to maybe have serious post that on social media and maybe announce that as well and I'd also would love to see that real-time information come to Google Maps the transit app and the web chariots website and also possibly maybe some like um screens and some of our popular shelters that could say real-time information that would be really neat as um and then let's see I drove the 19 on Juneteenth and my goodness I had a packed bus every trip and I missed two or three of the departures from downtown so and I understand you guys are planning on enhancing service in the future but we need more service on weekends absolutely um let's see and then the pride bus I absolutely loved it I hope we do it again for in many years to come I also would love to recommend wrapping buses for a bunch of other things Black History Month Rosa Parks her anniversary uh Halloween bus who know like a bunch of other Fourth of July Veterans Day Memorial Day all those things and TriMet they wrap their buses in-house their maintenance department does it so maybe I know we could train our maintenance department to wrap our buses instead of paying a third party company to do it I don't know how much how expensive it is or whatnot and then let's see um also maybe next year during pride month instead of making it for a win-win situation for everyone have the people have operators sign their name to volunteer to drive the pride bus and make it optional because I think there was quite a bit of tension in between a bunch of operators and stuff so I'm making an optional I mean operators who want to drive it get to and then people who don't want to don't have to consideration you're putting into the operations we really appreciate it thank okay so now we'll move on to Tyler is this close enough or closer I think if you speak up a little bit it might be able to catch you okay um anyway thank you Bradley because that was a concise version of what I've been wanting to say anyway I'm Tyler McCauley I'm a I've been around for a while and I wanted to first off I'm glad there's a huge gap but uh Mr bus mayor Davidson I would just like to you know congratulate you I remember when you were when you you were elected and your speech gave me a great summary of what it's been what's happened since I've been in attendance and I really appreciated your personal testimony and and a view of how that your personal life since you've been a board member has shaped your your agenda and what you your idea of what you wanted to do I really really really appreciated that um I had much more to say but I will save it for another day when I can maybe get Bradley to help me concise things down thank you guys oh and also thank you also thank you past present future of any help you guys have had in keeping me safe on the road sidewalk Etc I'm very appreciative of the fact that all the buses have lots of cameras and how that coordinates with um you know liability even if it doesn't directly involve you thank you I don't think we have any other public comment online Okay so we've got one public commenter Maya Bang uh yes hi um my name is mai I am the oh look go ahead okay sorry I am the new Transportation chair for uh the Northeast Salem Community Association and we just recently had our monthly board meeting and a few questions kind of popped up that I wanted to relay to chariots to consider and maybe follow up with an answer uh relatively soon but um so one of the questions we had were was um a the return of a bus route to d um I was informed that years ago there was a route on D Street but it was uh it was stopped and so we were just wondering whether that route could come back with the new development uh on D Street and Park and then so that was the first question and then the second question that we had um is chariots going to continue to offer free bus rides in the summer and if that program is still is still ongoing or whether it's stops and we just kind of wanted to have more information about that because there's a lot of um I think there's a lot of need in our um neighborhood that I think continuing that program would help so those are just the two questions that we had and we wanted to present to the Chariot board and have it for thank you very much I think thanks for coming and giving us some public testimony and we'll definitely see if we can get back to you uh with some answers to those questions okay so I don't so I don't see anyone else in the public for public comment and no one else is online so we're going to go ahead and move on to our agenda item seven our consent calendar does any director wish to pull an agenda all right is there a motion to approve the consent I moved to approve the consent calendar second all right motion a second is there any discussion on the matter okay so all those in favor please say any opposed seeing no opposition motion passes unanimously all right and now we'll move on to action items all right so the first action item is to accept the preliminary Financial year fiscal year 2023 financial report general manager Pollock yes I'll ask us our financial officer Denise LaRue please come forward and present the good evening president and members of the board tonight I am presenting the FY 23 estimated financial and then general fund revenues and uh all items are at 90 or above with property taxes Oregon State and Liu funds and interest on investments all being over 100 percent of the budget we have talked about the anomaly with the interest on investments uh in the previous quarters but that is definitely the biggest variance but it's a positive one so that's always good for the general fund requirements and expenses all divisions are at or below the annual budget as required by Oregon budget law these numbers are after applying the budget amendment that was approved at the June board meeting we still have a few more expenses that will fall into there but we will still be far below the the budget the requirements for the Oregon budget law for the transportation programs fund resources and revenues in total we are currently at 58 of the budget currently as the year-end calculations and drawdowns are completed through our year-end process these numbers will change a bit but stay within the same range for the transportation programs fund requirements and expenses they are all below budget the current average is 62 percent and again as the revenue shift the expenses will shift in the same proportion as those drawdowns are prepared for the capital and resources and revenues at the time of this estimation we were at 23 percent of budget again these will adjust with the year-end movement but as you remember in FY 23 we had some very significant supply chain issues and so those items have all been carried over to the fy24 adopted budget for the capital projects fund requirements and expenses again these are still coming in for the fiscal year I think we have three or four more Capital invoices that are in will be in in the next couple of days but at the time of this estimate we were at 27 percent of the annual budget for the finance division the majority of expenses have come in for the Marty project or the management and resource tracking instrument with just a very small amount carried over for fy24 in the technology and program management the some of the projects are well underway but had didn't have a lot of expense in FY 23 and those include some of our very large favorite projects right now of South Salem Transit Center and the transit signal priority the capital projects in operations are also under budget but that's mainly due to to the delay experience with the battery electric and all of the supply chain issues there may I answer any questions do we have any questions all right thank you very much and thank you for your continued work in our accounting thank you all right so is there a motion to accept the preliminary fiscal year 2023 financial report yes all right I moved at the board except the fiscal year 2023 preliminary year-end financial report as presented seconded all right Motion in a second is there any discussion on the matter seeing none all those in favor please say I I have any opposed seeing no opposition motion passes unanimously and we'll move on to agenda item 10 informational reports we have one informational report this evening general manager Pollock SLS service planning manager Chris French to please come forward and present the report good evening president and a host pressie and members of the board I'm here this evening to provide the service briefing for the September service change it's a fairly minor change but there are things that are happening at the Kaiser Transit Center for the preparation for the battery electric buses we are rearranging where buses Park in order to charge the buses the the electric buses so that's a change at the transit center we've also in preparation for charging the buses the route 11. we've modified the schedule we have moved recovery time from the south end to the North End in order to allow more time during their recovery during the recovery time for them to be on the Chargers to allow the buses to charge uh for the Route 19 we've made some service changes uh when the traffic signal was installed at Kaiser Transit Center we had we had added an additional bus during the two to six pm to maintain on-time performance because we had to go all the way through prior we had to go all the way through Kaiser station which took four to five minutes which made the buses run late in the two to six pm period of time now that we have the signal we're able to we were able to look at the schedule and adjust and remove that additional bus saving some Revenue hours on the route 19. for the Route 21 we used for the Sundays weekend service we kind of used the middle of the road our what we call time bands which are the amount of time that the bus has to travel inbound and outbound between time points uh with the service being out on the street for some time we were able to look at that and modify some of this schedule to we didn't remove or add anything from the overall time but we adjusted the time points so buses weren't having to hold up on the outbound and then be late coming in on the inbound or some minor tweaks like that uh for Holiday",

        "text": " the facility taking into account mitigation that it's not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to soil now here i'm going to just kind of highlight and we have some things listed it's we have erosion and i'm just going to kind of skip over and then say chemical spills right those are kind of the big ones that we're going to talk about the proposed order and the asc talks about but it does also say including but not limited to meaning that it could talk about other things i do want to point out that the language here for the standard does correspond with the information requirement under division 21. so that the the application requirements say hey provide information about these things um and so that's that's the so that's what is generally provided however in this application it's exhibit i there is a wealth of information because this is a it's a long facility and there's lots of soil types etc the temporary impacts to soil um are about 4 300 acres and then the permanent impacts are about 757 acres um the temporary impacts or impacts that are associated oh we next slide please nancy that are associated with construction we're kind of familiar with talking about that so these are temporary roads the multi-use areas the pulling and tension tensioning sites and the activities that would impact soils are are the clearing and grubbing the vehicle compaction from going in and driving on these roads the temporary the areas temporarily impacted associated with the construction of the facility in restoration would have to be decompacted and and re-vegetated and there are conditions that address both of those um the permanent impacts to soils are kind of make sense they are uh like the permanent tower structure the permanent uh infrastructure on the ground are those permanent impacts and then uh next slide this is just i have a map here there's a very large map set um that maps out all of the the soils the analysis area for soil protection is just the area within the site boundary so that's what you would see on those map sets so there's um several soil protection conditions kind of inadvertently rerouted to one that we talked about earlier under structure again i'm just pulling and highlighting some conditions but there are more than what i'm pulling out in here the staff report summarizes some too them too but there's more conditions than what we're providing but we can talk about anything but soil protection condition one council is probably used to seeing this this condition this is that um prior to construction the applicant will obtain and provide to the department the the nippy's permit the national pollution discharge elimination system 1200 c general construction permit typical of that permit or required in that permit is an erosion sediment control plan so this is kind of this is a federally delegated permit that is not a permit that council's making a decision on but the department requested you use this information to demonstrate compliance underneath the soil protection standard and a lot of it is that erosion and sediment control plan because that has those best management the bmps about how the applicant's going to reduce runoff soil erosion dust control and then up on the slide here i have the soil protection condition five has that the certificate holder shall inspect the facility components for impacts as part of its regular transmission line inspections which this is more of the operational aspect of addressing impacts to soils and that's what i have do you want to add anything okay okay so um thank you callum so we have one um issue under soil protection that was raised by dr fowdy she filed exceptions and uh great and the issue is whether the soil protection standard and general standard of review require an evaluation of soil loss of soil structure and infiltration and loss of stored carbon in the soil and loss of soil productivity as a result of the release of stored carbon in soils hearing officer's opinion talked about the the structure of the standard language and the use of the phrase that uh um kellen had mentioned the including but not limited to language um and uh um read that to say that the you know there are certain enumerated things and again those appear in the uh the council's division 21 application rules as well in terms of what needs to be submitted for a complete application um that are specifically enumerated so we have the erosion application of chemical substances but the hearing officer's view was that this the included but not limited to doesn't necessarily require that an application for site certificate evaluate um things that are um you know uh perhaps of a different kind than the uh the list had uh provided so um the issues raised by dr faudi including the soil compaction and structure etc the hearing officer also ruled that neither the application for site content rule nor the standard itself require that the applicant use a specific methodology to evaluate soil types or characteristics or require a presentation of the highest level of detail from the most current um the standard does not require the applicant to establish a specific time frame for restoration or recovery idaho power correctly evaluated soil types within the analysis area and evaluated impacts based on potential locations of temporary and permanent response to issue as it was initially presented by dr foughty and then supported by her idaho power during the contested case provided an updated table that presented soil information by county with the soil order id name percent and acreage of disturbance area and soil properties soil production conditions two and three would minimize erosion and spill impacts during construction efficient wildlife habitat conditions would also ensure that temporary soil impacts are restored post-construction through vegetation and noxious weed control within a reasonable time frame to as close to pre-disturbance conditions as possible so that's the the issue as it was framed in the contested case and the hearing officer's ruling and uh um and so um now is the time for dr faudy to provide oral argument hi my name is carl newt i represent stop and for purposes of tonight i'm assisting dr fowdy also stop b-2-h concurred in dr faudy's materials and her presentations and so i'm going to cover both her materials and stops concurrence and do so briefly and then hopefully answer any questions you might have i want to start with the key points which are that the proposed contested case order omitted any findings related to dynamic soil property changes there's a lot of data put in about but that's not the only impact compaction dynamic soil makes a huge in addition the administrative law judge made an evidentiary ruling at the end of the process where she improperly excluded documents that should have been in the those are both fundamental errors in our part in our view doctor foughty is a phd she's a soil specialist and a hydrologist since she lives here in negrand she knows her materials her testimony was that ipc had failed to the impacts from the proposed facility in sufficient detail she used best available science in her her testimony was in our view and if you listen to the recordings i think you would agree never really credibly when dr fowley foughty outlined in her closing remarks fact that there was a host of failures by ipc's expert in particular to address some of the basic documents that ipc's own expert relied ipc asked that those documents be stricken from the record the alj mistakenly agreed and as a result gave less weight to dr faudi's testimony any document that ipc and its experts used should have been part of the record because without that the applicant could claim anything was true and the public wouldn't have the opportunity and this council wouldn't have the opportunity to review materials and determine if they agreed dr fowdy outlined how ipc had failed to demonstrate compliance with the standard there was a lot of discussion about how i and the condition you saw a few minutes ago on sp1 was that the department was relying on the npdes permit from deq that permit as was outlined by dr faudi only addresses erosion it does not address compaction it does not address dynamic soil changes it does not address any of those other issues reliance on that is inadequate there were a number of fundamental problems with the ipc analysis i encourage you to read dr faudi's exceptions they're very detailed and very scientific and thank you secretary clinet as i was going to point out that i'm using both her time and um doctor foughty also outlined how the proposed mitigations by ipc were not consistent with the stated goals they weren't peer-reviewed and they didn't follow the literature she noted that ipc used the wrong nrc soil database when anal resi that resulted in planning level analysis rather than project level analysis that's important when you're doing ipc use the wrong analysis for soil impacts because it used a larger soil rather than a smaller soil impact area thus incorrectly minimizing the nature or the magnitude of the soils impacts ipc misrepresented the longevity this soil impact by stating that the impacts would be temporary and then defining temporary as the life of the project which you have already heard is forever not what most of us would consider a temporary impact she also noted that ipc failed to provide a soils restoration plan instead relied on vegetation restoration plan as a proxy for soil productivity ipc also failed to identify major soil in the analysis area incorrectly discussed the soil order the broad highest level soil category and they failed to identify all current land uses on productive soils that's also important the fundamental problem here is that the uh dr faudi's testimony should have been given more weight the hearings officer disregarded some of the literature she cited and we think that this under the circumstances should motivate this council to send this issue back for further analysis by the administrative law just in a further hearing on these detailed scientific issues i'm happy to answer any questions if you have any thank you carl i didn't get your last name anuta anuta any questions of mr okay thank you uh thank you again this is jocelyn pease for idaho power for the record dr foudy raised many issues in her exceptions filing and idaho power fully addressed these issues in its responsive all this focus on several of the key arguments that dr faudi had made in her exceptions filing and attempt to address in in the short time the number a number of the issues that mr anuta had also first in her exceptions filing dr fowdy argues that idaho power should have addressed additional soil properties in its analysis regarding the soil protection standard in support of this argument dr fowdy emphasized language in the standard regarding impacts to soils including but not limited to erosion and",

        "text": " submitted on that blog that's not anything we can take account of they would have to submit them to us maybe I'll ask Council if he'll submit them okay good thank you sure Katie Glover and then Chelsea Fain is looks like Katie may not have wanted to wait Katie okay Chelsea and then Chad Higgins is next good evening I brought my my visual here for you guys um I have a quick question what's the longest running solar product that your company has done I don't know up top of my head but something I could definitely find so do you guys have any data as to what the long-term impact of these solar farms and these giant projects are on the um the agriculture the wildlife the groundwater and human health too we have data for that we do have white papers on how solar and soils um go with it one another so that we do have those resources yes but I'm not talking about soil I'm talking about human life and Wildlife and groundwater especially like if the Sheep grazing doesn't work out and I'm not a farmer but I I know that the Sheep grazing is not just to farm Chic they rotate the crops with the Sheep so the manure can fertilize the ground and it's like the best organic fertilizer that you can get so what good is just cheap grazing and doing a mowing for you what if that doesn't work out what are you gonna do just mow it are you going to use weed killers like what type what is the long-term impact of on the groundwater on human health on Wildlife what's the long-term impact so when it comes to solar and I guess ground impacts um Q cells doesn't have any white papers on it but that's definitely something we could dig into we can provide sources to other uh white papers that have been done when it comes to solar and then to answer your question when let's just say if the Sheep thing does not work out quote um as Todd has already stated there would be a compliance requirement um so if that is a stated use within the project and we're required to comply with that and get continued use of uh sheep grazing on the site for the life of the project okay but I just wanted on the record that you guys don't know the long-term impact of these things and you don't know what your longest running solar project is I personally don't know the impact of solar on uh grounds but I'm sure there are definitely research papers out there that I can probably find and if you'd like to know about them that's something we could do as a follow-up item so try to send you some sources and then when it comes to the longest running project at Q cells admittedly I don't know that so I apologize but that's something that we could definitely get what was the earliest project that Q cells built okay so you don't know the longest type of running project but we're still willing to invite into our very backyards a 40 year long project my son is three months old he's going to be 40 years old there's another little baby right here it's gonna be 40 years old I know it's easy for all of us to get up in arms about this because of how it's going to impact us but in reality how's it going to impact the children of Oregon how is it going to impact their future when we don't even have the data how do we don't even know how it's going to impact our groundwater how it's going to impact the soil what if it does it doesn't work out is it going to be abandoned I've heard so many things that we don't have the answers to and so many things of like we're going to do a six month long study of the wildlife between May and what was it August or September I'm sorry sorry that this is Oregon like this is a wildlife capital of the Pacific Northwest we have so many amazing diverse wildlife and six months is not going to cut it and you don't have the data and yet you're willing to impose this 40-year project on our children and I just don't see how that's helpful at uh the only thing that I can add and follow up to the comment is that um storm water specifically how it hits the panels runs off impacts the soils will be studied um just because we don't have an answer tonight doesn't mean we won't have one and so there will be there's a very robust I think Todd's alluded to it all the standards what they look like up um I can tell you what that translates to is is binders full of information and so not all of it is prepared right now so what we know is kind of what we've assessed based on we call a desktop study but that's just you know publicly available data so a lot of the study that is going to go into this especially with regard to soils has yet to be done or is in the process of being done and will be a part of this very robust application so it's not um it wouldn't do anyone a service to come in and um you know not have these things fully vetted but for that application is present before the fset council because it does have ramifications for commitments and conditions down the line so those things will be assessed so I don't want there to be the implication that because there's not an answer now tonight that there can't be one or won't be one but it is something that will certainly work towards and would be incorporated with the application okay but even that data that you can provide is still going to be your best guess because we don't have a 40-year long project to refer to to see what the impact is going to be so it's still just going to be your best guess that I can speak to I mean there's there's probably not a project in Oregon that's been around for 40 years so there there are projects that have been constructed are successful and have been in operation and those are kind of what we look to moving forward as far as you know kind of models for this development and will continue to be for you know I'd imagine for the industry um but yeah as as to your point it's like is there one around for 40 years I'm not I'm not sure but that's something that we can certainly look to as we continue to evaluate the materials okay thank you and then I have one more question for you guys so Oregon the Pacific Northwest is pretty rainy and pretty overcast so how do the six to seven rainy and overcast months of the year help support 35 000 homes with electricity and are these things even going to be functioning from November through May with minimal direct sunlight um to address your question about the lifespan of this project the 40 years that's not a number that we just kind of threw out there it's more of an industry standard so when it comes to solar projects the lifespan that's projected is 35 to 40 years that's a that's a pretty standard thing in the industry as for the energy production we do something called a PV assist or an 8760 and essentially that uses historic uh data weather data could be from five years it could be 10 years or whatever is publicly available and then we use that and then we map out the site basically the layout of the project and any potential um restrictions or things of like I guess we call them constraints and then we do a projection to see what would be the energy energy production and that is also a factor in us when we kind of try to cite these projects so understandably it is a little bit cloudy and a little bit wet in Oregon just a little bit but even with that using the weather data we still have good enough production to make this project viable so I have solar panels on my house in between November and May they're not working they and they're good panels and they may not be your panels from your company but they're still good panels and they cost a really pretty penny and they don't work six months out of the year so I'm just wondering are they just going to be an for half the year and only providing like energy for half the year because that seems like a really big project and a really risky thing when we don't have the data to go out 40 years to put upon the people of this area when we don't even know if it's going to work year round and we don't even know what the long-term impact is that's all thank you okay my understanding is Katie Glover is back in the room so Katie and then Chad Higgins some people want some answers to my question the when it comes to regards of any white papers things of that nature we can post it on to our project website I'm not sure if it's something we should be posting to the portal for the project um but also yeah if there's anything that we would like for you all would like follow up that's definitely something we could put on our website thank you hello I'm Katie Glasser and um I want to start out by saying that actually you guys did do a presentation to the Linn County Farm Bureau meeting last month and we appreciated you guys coming it um I think it went longer than you guys expected initially but there's a lot of back and forth you guys talked about what you were doing and then we had a lot of questions and gave some suggestions too and one of those suggestions was that this is a very controversial issue and we suggested get out into the community talk to people make sure that you're very transparent you're sharing everything you can with us and one thing that we really really said was don't plan a meeting in the middle of harvest and you looked at us and very sincerely seemed like you would kind of follow some of these suggestions and said yeah that that sounds like some some good advice and so here we are July 25th in the middle of harvest and I'm looking around and I'm actually surprised at how many farmers I see and how many should be in the field right now but they're here because this is such an important topic an issue and it's going to be impacting a lot of people so uh the main thing that I want to say and bring up is I guess I do lean more on the side of with private property we should be able to do what we want however we have land use laws and at county level state level and I guess what's frustrating about this is because your company has enough time and money you're going to be able to do what you want whereas the rest of us that don't have that time and money have",

        "text": " provide us some flexibility there um but at most it would be a one: one ratio of solar panels to battery storage uh as I mentioned that it's on the BP uh excuse me the BPA uh system our Pro so BPA allows us to choose two pois or point of interconnections our first is along the bucket of grizzly 500 KB line number two which is directly adjacent to the project uh we would effectively be what's called tapping the line or constructing a new substation on site uh and having our point of interconnection be on site with the project the other option we are exploring is running about a 4 and a half mile Genai North into Buckley substation in Sherman County um this is something that is not yet it is something we're looking at it's something that we're doing our diligence on uh it's not something we fully yet secured um so we'll continue to look at this as an option uh but for now we do have an initial uh point of interconnection secured at uh the and then quickly just on permitting and site control so site control being um you know the land that we have under control we have the full amount of land 8,075 Acres there about um and are have interconnection secured and this past summer we uh completed all of our field surveys and studies in preparation for the F permitting process so just a quick T quickly touch on product Milestones our timeline uh some basic stats so at 800 megaw we are looking to power 182,000 homes with uh renewable energy 8,75 Acres all in Wasco County uh the expected life of this solid project is 40 Years of operation and at a project of this size we expect a capital investment of a billion or more uh by the developer by ourselves so we were able to get all of our land under control earlier this year um and field studies wrapped up at the end of fall and as all you know the reason we're sitting here our notice intent was issued at the beginning of October so that kicked off the fet permitting process the ASC or the application for site certificate that's really as Kate mentioned that is the full site uh permitting application we're aiming to have that done by the end of January next year hopefully sooner uh but there's a lot of information to gather there so that is about a two-year process so we're estimating our permit to oh to have received our permit by the end of 2025 and we're looking at c commercial operations date the date that the construction is completed and we are putting energy on the grid at earliest by the end of 2028 and you know the one thing to mention throughout all of this and this is going to be a theme um in the presentation but in how I answer questions or comments is that you know we are looking to engage to hear comments from to to uh make connections with any stakeholder agencies uh even you know local community members that are involved impacted by this project so that has already started and it will continue all the way through and past our commercial operations St so this is a facility an overview of the facility I won't spend too much time here we actually have a map printed out over there if you didn't get a chance to see it feel free to go check it out after the presentation contact um so again U I would be the main point of contact I have my business card over there uh by where Sarah is sitting so feel free to take one uh shoot me a message give me a call whenever you'd like um anuka soulsby is our permitting connect is our our the permitting uh person on this um and then you know also this will be circulated so should you need to talk to Mitch or Gary who is head of engineering proc and construction they contact there well reach that question and answer and comment period of our meeting I just wanted to go over really quickly if you are on the web act um this slide shows you how to participate or raise your hand to make a comment or ask a question um there is also a number on the notice if you're on the phone there's instructions on how to participate via phone we're going to leave this slide up during the Q&amp;A in the com perod but we're going to start as I had noted before people people in the room people on the WebEx and then people on the phone and we will work on that one of the things that I fail to mention at the beginning is that if you do want to comment um it's really important to us that we get your name accurately there are comment cards on the back table if you want to make a public comment tonight we ask that you fill one out so that we have your information um if if you are wanting to make an oral comment tonight um I think we're just going to open it up and see if there's anybody who wants to make a comment and we do ask that you come up and sit at the table and speak into the microphone so we can get it recorded the meeting is recorded and so we're going to start with the um people in the room you don't have to speak if you don't want to you can also just write a comment on the comment card and hand it to Sarah to Nancy or to me or to chase before you leave tonight and um like I said there's multiple ways to comment after this meeting as well and you can also ask questions you don't have to just count comment just ask clarifying questions what we just went over so I'm going to stop and see if there's anybody in the room that would like to comment we wait a couple minutes people prid you had a question question name the record that my name is Ken Clark um with the recent uh federal emergency Regulatory Commission order 2023 and the bpaq reform as a generator uh when do you expect to be able to receive an inter connection agreement and a commercial I think you said but a commercial operation date yeah um that is a great question one that we are you know very closely monitoring and very have been very much involved in the bpaq process um you know I'll be honest there is a bit of uncertainty as to how these reforms in the bpaq reform will play out um we are targeting like we said end of 2028 for commercial operations date I will say that is aggressive um you know I I would I would probably say that it's anywhere from 2028 to 2030 based on how we're seeing those um reforms play out um so in terms of when we expect interconnection I mean just kind of working backwards I think that that we would be looking at then in the 2026 range and again all this is um so those are General dates that we're we're looking at now but again are closely monitoring this process and how that affects the timelines on our project have you entered the bpaq yeah so we we do have two positions for these projects um without going too deep into the the mechanics of the bpaq um we we are in the um the transitionary cluster um basically to not make that deadline there would be significant impacts for the timeline but we filed Q uh we have four Q positions of which were filed either early this year or late last year yeah as best as I was able to ascertain the best estimate I could come up with is that uh the BPA will not start uh reviewing transmission clusters until 2025 that sound um you know I'll kind of you've been most involved with the epaq reform would you say that's accurate for those in the least so that's that's a moving Target I think unfortunately a lot of things in the BPA process are moving targets right now but you're you're generally generally correct and and what they might be getting to issuing additional one question so you said on Buckley 2 you've secure it all in title notes or necessary use notes no no no so with Buckley we have not we are still exploring that possibility for the line tap we have um you know the Land There we have everything we need to to interconnect on site with Buckley there is still easements um and other agreements or or parties to to work with to actually secure that so something we're still working on at this time great thank questions there anyone else in the room that like comment question you put the math up while people are do you want me to spell it if it's complicated yes d uls k i that's the bullus I'm Joe de buus I'm the Sherman County judge and so my question pertains to your second option going to buckle is that a choice you guys make to go over there or is that would be a choice for for the from BPA for an interconnect and why would you choose to go there over um right I'm good question so I mean it's a choice that we make contingent upon working with various parties needed to secure easements to get there uh and gain access to the station so if we're able to secure that um then it is our choice the reason why we would go there as opposed to interconnecting on SES is it is significantly more exp expensive to build a new sub station which we would be required to do if we connected on site now we are willing to do that we don't think that that will um you know overly negatively affect the economics of the project that being said um if we can go to an ex existing substation that allows us to have lower costs therefore sell energy at lower prices so this may be a question you can or cannot answer I may not know when is Buckley cons going to be upgraded oh uh um I'm just curious if your information same as my information yeah I'm not entirely sure do you have like an estimate from BPA as to when it might be upgraded no it's going to start so um within next couple years it's going to start is what I'm told but that's in in a meeting like this so it's not that's something handed to me so we're g to start yeah generally in line with what we've heard but um I think that that would be something we would get more information on as we keep getting more studies back from DPA which have been somewhat delayed due to the Q process the reform um so unfortunately my information now is probably better than thanks is there anyone else who wants to comment tonight or ask a question okay and like I said if you just want to write a comment",

        "text": " standards evolved the application requirements and the procedural rules also did but over time the relationship between those information requirements uh and the standards themselves have become a little less clear so we came to the council with a proposal to work on a multi-phase role making project to update clarify and simplify the procedural rules for the site certificate application review as part of your 2021-2023 rulemaking process or rulemaking schedule and the council approved us to begin our initial work the project was also identified in the department's implementation plan for executive order 2004 as a possible means to accelerate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by improving efficiencies and deciding the council is generally authorized to adopt standards and rules for the sighting of energy facilities and for the implementation of oregon's we want to know that the process for the application process or sorry the procedures for the application review process are generally described in rs 469 330 to 370. and while that really lays out the major milestones that need to be met and a lot of the administrative procedures around and public engagement there's still a lot of leeway on exactly how the council conducts this process some of the steps that are currently in the rules aren't required by statute uh some of the steps currently required by statutes which happen aren't described in the rules and so we think that this rule making is needed to clarify and simplify those those those those steps uh to clarify and simplify application requirements to improve consistency and standardizations in the review process and just to make the process clearer and more understandable for applicants reviewing agencies and interested members of the public the rulemakings are intended to create efficiencies and reduce the time and cost associated with state jurisdictional review um while having no negative effects on public participation and i want to say that that language is lifted directly from the el 2004 implementation plan um but as we're going through this we will really be looking for ways to enhance opportunities for public while not necessarily adding new we do want to see if we can make those existing opportunities a little bit to address those goals that i've just discussed we've broken the project down into three main objectives and we plan to tackle one of those objectives through each phase of this rulemaking project so phase one is to separate the procedural and substantive rules to simplify and clarify procedures where phase two is to take a deeper dive into the application information requirements and to make sure that those information requirements align up with the requirements of the standards themselves and then phase three will be to look at the standards and the substantive and see if they are appropriate for different types of energy facilities renewable energy facilities and then we would make adjustments if warranted and we do want to point out that um since we kind of did the scoping initial scoping for this rulemaking process uh hb 2021 passed and that really limits the decisions that the council can make to approve uh new fossil fuel power energy generation facilities so we may also want to kind of relocate some of those standards that are in rules that are applicable to existing fossil fuel power generation facilities uh to kind of um i guess put them out of the way if they won't be used regularly to make our rules more clearly appropriate for the types of facilities we expect to see in the chris before you leave this actually can you go back to that slide because i think this is helps looking at this from the space so just a little more kind of description phase one really is just sort of alignment no substantive changes you know you know there may be some differences of you know how where the the rules are located but the idea is just sort of that first step so there's really no substantive changes as part of that rule making whatsoever phase two as we start to figure out what's the standard what are the requirements to see as part of that you know to justify you've met that standard that necessarily will start getting into some substance but kind of in the middle and then phase three is absolutely substantive um and phase three is probably more than just one rule making it's probably a host of rule makings because if we start to look at specific standards we can't deal with you know five or six or 14 standards all at once it would just be substantively too much so that one of itself will likely have to be broken down in some way we haven't figured that out yet there's definitely going to be very iterative as we move these series of rule makings but i just wanted to kind of forecast that out a little bit you know at least what what we're thinking right now at the staff level so thanks thank you secretary cornett um yeah i think that's a very good description uh and i think it is good to know that well i will uh not say that we won't make any substantive changes during this phase of the rulemaking we are certainly intending to minimize um the creation of new um procedural or substantive requirements and actually we will try to avoid to the extent possible the creation of any new substantive but we may flesh out procedural issues or do a little housekeeping around the procedures uh where that makes sense and if there's low low picking fruit i would low hanging fruit um okay uh so as we showed on that last slide the scope of really of phase one is really to reorganize the rules uh in division 15 to division 26 to create that clear separation of procedural and some substantive provisions and then to simplify our clarify procedures where um i've broken that down into two sub objectives and that is to separate out the procedural and substantive rules and that's really where we're going to be reorganizing the rules to clearly identify what is substantive and what is um and i'm going to go into depth uh into that in a little more detail because i think it's a little in the weeds of what you mean by that um and then our second objective is to simplify and clarify uh where practicable and that would just involve things like eliminating duplicative procedural um consolidating procedural rules that are steps that are repeated at multiple points in the process uh and then identifying if there's procedural gaps or unclear processes and that's specifically if there's things that we're statutorily obligated to do or that the council just regularly does as part of its practice that aren't describing the rules we'd like to fill uh those in so that the rules kind of to provide a complete um i think a to z uh overview of what the process actually looks like um so unless there's any questions on that i'll go ahead and start talking uh what we mean by separating substantive and procedural rules okay so the first step you know any exercise where you're trying to separate out uh two different categories of things is to establish what the categories are themselves uh and so in the scoping of this uh we did a little work and we've come up with some working definitions for what we mean by substantive requirements and procedural a substantive rule is a rule that establishes a right duty or obligation for an applicant or certificate holder and examples of the substantive rules would include some information requirements that establish the information or evidence that must be provided for the council to evaluate compliance with the standard standards themselves and i'm sorry uh does somebody have a question so standards themselves which in an old supreme court case they describe as establishing the yardstick by which the evidence will be evaluated um and then other substantive requirements include conditions or obligations that describe specific rights duties or obligations for the certificate holder um so those substantive requirements can come up at different parts of the process they can either be included in the um you know subsidy requirements that must be met for completeness uh some sort of requirements that must be satisfied for the council to make its or uh requirements that the certificate holder has an ongoing duty to fulfill but um those are uh contrast to procedural rules that just prescribe the steps that must be taken and methods that must be used to implement a substantive rules uh so example of the procedural rules include things like submission and noticing requirements deadlines and timing considerations uh procedures for agency coordination public meetings and public hearings also evidentiary rules and rules assigning the burden of proof which is a little bit of a gray area but um we've kind of put them here and then uh not to get too meta while we're defining what the different kinds of rules are but there's also definitional rules um which provides specific meanings for words and terms that uh may otherwise be uh and we just wanted to point out that that there is a whole rule full of definitions and there may be specific definitions including each rule generally those shouldn't be they should not include substantive or procedural requirements um so as part of this process we may be looking at the definitions and just making sure that we haven't mixed any substance able procedural rules in there so to give a little bit more of an example of how this phase one might look have kind of presented here an overview a very high level overview of what the the site certificate application review process looks like um generally the steps for this process as i mentioned before are described in rs 469 330 to 370. first the applicant submits its noi and then after that initial public review and agency review the department uses the information in the notice of intent to issue its project order and that project order would describe all the substantive substantive standards and application requirements that the applicant needs to demonstrate compliance with or satisfy in its application for site certificate the application for site certificate has a whole completeness review which you are all aware of and once we get to that completeness the department issues its draft proposed draft proposed orders is subject to public review and public hearing and after that process goes through and all the public testimony and agency comments are considered the department issues a proposed order and then at that point the process really transfers from the department to the council the council conducts a contested case and at the conclusion of the contestant case issues its final order insight certificate the procedures applicable to the department and to the council for this entire process are generally contained in division 15 and that division also contains procedures for expedited review and procedures for review of exemption requests so it's a pretty big division um conversely the procedures for the notice of intent and for the application are included that are applicable to the applicant are included in division 20 and 21. so we have the procedures kind of spread across these three divisions and one example of how we can create a little more clarity in the",

And let me just finish this. Are they cited for a code violation? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Just one speaking or more than one? Just two. Okay. So you just. If you can one speak and the other put their name and address down and then vice versa, kind of make it go along a little smoother. My name is Olivia O'Quinn. My address is 15271 Northeast 243rd court there in Salt Springs. We purchased this home just in January, I'm sorry, December of 2023. And we purchased the parcel separately from our home. When we purchased the parcel, the pole barn was already there. The barn. So we don't know when it was built. The owner didn't tell us. We didn't know it wasn't permitted until we tried to get electric. And that's why we're here. You don't have electric in there now? It's just a shell. Yes. We just store our toys in it because obviously our house is right across the street. What's it going to be used for? Just a shop. We have our side by sides and our boats in there. You're not going to need electric or water or anything? No water. We would like electric, though. My boyfriend has a welder and we like to plug our battery tender in for our boats and things like that. Did you understand the question that I asked? No, sir. Just to staff about whether there was a way for you to maybe have it permitted and have it there. Yes, sir. And not be able to build a house on that lot. Yes, sir. We don't. Then there was a question of if it were to ever be sold, it would have to be either torn down or turned into a home constructed. I'm not sure how the logistics of that would be, but I asked a question for you guys even come up just in case it you. That was your plan? Just to leave it there as your garage? Yes, sir, that is our plan. If it happens to be that we don't get the permit for the barn, we would convert it into maybe a barn dominium and have a bathroom and a. In a kitchen in there, if that's what we have to do. We don't want to tear it down. Okay, well, hopefully we'll keep that, you know, works. I'm at it. We do have time between now and the board of county commissioners meeting that you guys might check with staff and see if there's a way to work that out however this panel votes. Yes, ma'am. Did you want to speak in your name and address for the record? Cindy Bowles, the owner's agent and a friend. 15290 Northeast 216th court, Salt Springs, Florida, 32134. If we have. So she doesn't have to tear it down, I'm assuming, because of the size of it, that's the reason that it can't stay there. Is that what I understood? Because it's a 50 by 40 on that size lot. Well, it doesn't allow for a home to be built. There's no room for a. For a residential structure, common area, a kitchen, a bathroom in a. Well, that would be a question you. I would have to. That's what I was saying, that you do have some time between now and the board of county commissioners. No matter how the vote goes or what they says, that you might want to come back with them and see if there's a way to make that work. No matter what the board decision is here, we're recommending board to move forward. So if it's okay to say that. Fair to say that. To come back looking for guidance with staff, that they come back in and meet with you and see if there's a way to rectify it. Yes. They can meet with us to discuss options. And from looking at the aerials between our gis and the property appraisers gis, it looks like it was built between 2020 and 2021. But you bought the property at 21 23 20. You just bought it. Yeah. In January, right? Yeah. Well, I mean, just unfortunate that. Yeah. So is the. Is the building violating any code as far as boundary lines or anything like that? So the building likely meets setbacks, but it's not a primary structure. Primary structure in r1 is a single family home. So that lot is zone four residential. Correct. So you have to have a primary residence on it. You can't just have an accessory building there, which is what that is qualifying as. So you need a special use permit? They come. We've had a few applications here and there where individuals will live across the street and want it for, you know, an extra garage or an extra shed. But if they converted it to a home and it meets all other setbacks then they wouldn't need a special use permit. But it's the fact that it's not a primary residents. Has there been an inspection on the proper. On the building to see whether or not it meets code? No, there has not. No. They have to get this approved in order for it to start going through the building permit process which would then determine if it meets all the other setbacks and all of the other Florida building code. But no, at this point it's just. They've been notified it violates the code. They're here to ask for the this to be approved and if this is not approved then they would have to look at what other options they have to come into compliance. I'm sorry to interrupt. We actually asked for this before we got coded. We've been working on this. As soon as we bought the property we knew we wanted to get electric and we didn't have permits. So as soon as we brought the property we wanted to do the right thing. And also we did have it engineered already as well and we have the plans for that. Let me just ask the applicant a question. Do you want to turn this thing into a barn? I mean a home? No, we don't. I mean because it just seems like. Doesn't make any sense that you'd have to put a kitchen and bathroom. All you want to do is put boats in it. Yes sir, we own it. That house is 2400 sqft. We are plenty big enough for anything that we want. We just want to be able to store our toys and our tools and the things that we have. Because it looks like that's a garage attached to the home but it's actually had been closed in the. We don't have a garage to put anything in. So you ken, if we disagree with staff's findings and then recommend approval that wouldn't do the job for her special use permit. If the special use permit was approved they would be able to keep the building as it is. And we have some, some conditions that would also need to be applied. But are they aware of the conditions they should have been. They should have been sent to. You just got to show for everything. And we've been getting the code things. I mean if this building is two, three years old it doesn't look like it's. I mean that was expensive building, 2000 square foot. I think the biggest issue is how that you. How that you would handle if they were to go ahead and sell it. In the future, I think it doesn't. It wouldn't comply. Again, just. Same thing that's happened to them. Well, yeah. The special land use goes with the property owner. Right. Not the property. Right. Yeah. So, I mean, that's. They couldn't sell it that way because then somebody else would be in code violation. I got a. Over your conditions again. Yes. So the conditions, if that staff is recommending, if the SuP is approved, that it would need, you know, so there's condition that if water and sewer is to be added, it would require permits through the Department of Health. If utilities are to be altered or changed, that would also need to go through some kind of permit review. The applicant shall maintain a five foot, no touch buffer around the north, west and south of the perimeter. So everything but the front. Just leave the vegetation there. No signs on the property, and the site shall be developed and operated consistent with the submitted plan. It shall not be expanded because it would be a non conforming use at that point. We're good with. Hold on just a second is more. It would be limited to just this barn or to just this detached garage, as you know, cannot be expanded any further. Expansion requests would have to come back through this process. It shall run with the subject property and the owner. And this is where number nine. I'm not sure. I don't really agree with that because if they sell the property, the structure is still going to be there and we would just make the next person come in and do the same thing. So I would recommend striking number nine and the special use permit should just expire if the building is removed. So I'm in number ten. I got a question for the. So you weren't aware of this at all when you purchased it? Correct. Did you purchase the house from the same party that owns this and we bought them separately. And I'm sure this is the reason why we're first time home buyers. Okay, so you guys are experts on this, I guess. And it would never appear",

        "text": " uh Department of Environmental Quality and I believe director Benner and perhaps others from Odo as well are are here to uh join me describing uh our nascent approach to uh epa's climate pollution reduction grants um this is a portion uh of the inflation reduction act uh one of several pots of money that the IRA provided to EPA to dispense and this one is focused on uh States local governments tribes and to develop plans uh to reduce climate pollution within their jurisdictions and then provide funding more importantly perhaps to implement those plans so I'll pause there I think Zach's pulling up slides there we go I think I am back can you hear me yes Kathy I can hear you did you want to go back to the previous agenda item for a moment and I'm happy to pause here and yeah I think we were wrapped up I would say if people have specific questions for Christy um maybe go ahead and put them in the chat or questions that others might be set up and we'll see if we have extra time later in the meeting um just so we can get a little bit back on track on schedule and then I did just want to add as you kick off Colin thanks for doing that while I was getting the slides up um that this uh Grant is really um provides a great opportunity to hopefully help move the roadmap recommendations forward and so there is um you know while this is going to be a new Grant a new work uh hopefully the roadmap recommendations and all the work that the commission did leading up to this uh will help inform the work ahead that uh Colin and others will talk about thank you yeah absolutely I think uh for the state of Oregon this uh climate pollution reduction Grant or cprg for shorthand it has um is really building upon a lot of work we've already done in Oregon in large part um already done as a consequence of the Oregon global warming commission and the and the for example the roadmap to 2030 uh I think for many states this uh this uh fund uh represents a chance to develop from Whole cloth new plans uh plans that don't exist for them uh but in Oregon we have a lot of existing climate planning work to uh uh build upon and and help us he realized and funded through this program uh and that's I think that puts us in a really exciting position here uh and I'll talk more about that as we move uh but just by way of orientation here the the cprg is a five billion dollar pot of money uh that again the inflation production Act of 2022 uh provides uh to EPA uh to offer quote grants to States local governments tribes and territories to develop and Implement plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that's not from the act itself I believe that's from a that's a descriptor from EPA uh in in their interpretation of what uh what they are directed to do with this with these funds and the first thing that they I have done is to peel off a quarter billion dollars of that five billion uh to fund planning uh cprg plans from those uh entities uh I just mentioned again States local governments tribes and territories and then the remainder uh uh of that 5 billion is uh then to fund implementation of those if we go to the next slide thanks Zach uh so uh how they've apportioned those planning funds again that quarter billion dollars uh uh is for first for three million dollars for each state uh that applies uh this is non-competitive uh so and my understanding is that I believe 46 States uh did end up applying uh for for their three million dollar allotment Oregon certainly one of them um and then as well as one million dollars for large uh Metropolitan statistical areas of which there's only one in Oregon that's the Portland Hillsborough Vancouver area I think it was they chose the top 67 by population msas and again Portland's the only one uh that makes that cut and then uh it's still I think to be determined amount of money uh for tribal governments uh and my understanding is that uh a lot of this is being I should say is being implemented through epa's regions EPA as a federal agency has uh 10 different regions that um that Implement a lot of uh um regulations uh from headquarters uh and we're in region 10 and region 10 which is I believe Oregon Washington Idaho and Alaska happens to have a pretty extraordinary High concentration of tribal governments my understanding is that region 10 is still working to negotiate the amount of the federal funds overall that are available for tribal governments that will be apportioned to region 10 and the again considerable number of federally recognized tribes uh in the northwest region in Alaska uh let's go to the next slide thanks Zach so jumping into these planning grants again each state gets three million dollars uh and we're focused here on on on the state um planning grants again there are other grants available for uh potentially up to each of the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon as well as what our understanding is that uh Metro plans to apply for the uh Portland Hillsborough Vancouver MSA uh one million dollar Grant but some Focus here talking here about Oregon's Statewide plan uh cprg planning and here EPA has directed States uh primarily to develop uh two different uh deliverables uh the first is a priority climate action plan and the second is a comprehensive climate action plan and I'll walk through the high level of the process here as shown on this slide and then dive a bit more into what we plan and what we understand is is intended for these priority climate action plans and then I hand it over to Janine to talk in more depth about our plans for our work plan uh for the Oregon's comprehensive climate action plan um so just quickly here on process uh timeline that EPA has laid out for those deliverables in this work um April 28th uh a little less than a month ago was the deadline for states to submit an application for cprg planning funds uh we did that uh on on the deadline as I understand again 45 other states did as well and then the first big milestone is the deliverable the uh deadline for that first plan the priority climate action plan that is March 1st of next year so less than a year from now uh is the deadline that EPA has charted and I'll talk through a little bit more about our plans for delivering that a little bit early because of some other deadlines or timelines that EPA has indicated uh but they're moving to the next uh major deliverable and that is again the so-called comprehensive climate action plan that is due uh late summer early fall of 2025 and then finally EPA asks for a status report due uh at the end of this grant period which is uh in the summer or in the fall of 2027. uh still unclear exactly what that status report uh what's expected there that obviously have some time to figure that out for EPA to figure that out for them to communicate that with States all right anticipation is it is more a status report on the use of implementation funds uh and how how those have been expended or being expended and results but again more information pending from APA we go to the next leg which actually I guess just yeah nice um wanting to Overlay uh what are also what we understand although this hasn't been officially announced nailed down um but from EPA they've indicated that plan to solicit for applications and these will be competitive for implementation funds again there's five billion dollars for the cprg overall and the inflation reduction act uh and about four and three quarters of that five billion are earmarked for implementation grants uh and those are again grants to implement uh actions identified I'll explain more on the next slide I believe about this but um these are grants to Implement measures that states identify in our priority climate action plans and EPA has suggested that they honor around early March will uh issue their solicitation for applications for um four and three-quarter billion dollar pot of cprg implementation funds and plan to close it as soon as 30 days thereafter and and have said that they intend to have that be the one-time window for applications for them to then award all of that four point uh six or seven billion dollars so a very critical period very critical and brief window uh for States uh and other entities to access uh those funds and then let's go to the next slide and I'll talk a bit more about the priority climate action plan thanks Zach uh so I already mentioned uh Oregon's another State's priority climate action plans are intended to identify the measures as I think that's the phrase or word that EPA uses the measures that are a priority to the states and other jurisdictions uh to reduce greenhouse gas emissions uh probably I don't think I actually said that already uh these are the cprg is uh intended to fund climate mitigation or greenhouse gas reduction measures uh our understanding is that resiliency or adaptation may be more available more on the more possible for tribal governments to apply for but less of uh for state and local jurisdictions really prioritizing climate mitigation um again projects that up front um so looking at the Timeline uh for the priority climate action plan we see that funding that three million dollars to States will be available uh beginning June 1st we've already applied for it but the funds won't actually can't actually be used and expended for work until June 1st uh and then that really kicks off what we anticipate to be a pretty intense period over the summer and fall for us to engage with others with state agencies local governments Community organizations and tribes to identify those measures uh to include in Oregon's priority climate action plan and we're shooting for a draft of that prior to climate action plan to be available for public review and comment late this year sometime around November uh and our hope is to publish this earlier recall I said EPA has said this is due to them March 1st we'd like to get it out uh and near if not completely final form uh at the beginning of next year sometime in January uh because if you recall if you notice that the dates line up the the March 1st is the deadline for uh pcaps to be submitted but March 1st is also the timeline that EPA has indicated is on or around that time when they will open up that 30-day window and that's a very brief amount of time for organizations to apply for uh implementation",

        "text": "okay uh good evening my name is Jim Cheney uh and I'm an attorney with the lane Council of governments elog Eugene and elog has entered into a contract with the City of Salem for me to serve as the hearings official for tonight for uh this hearing so for the record it's 5:30 p.m on this is April 22nd pardon 24th 24th April 24th 2024 and we're met in room 305 at the Salem Civic Center at 555 Liberty Street Southeast in sorei so today's hearing involves an application for a conditional use permit class class three site plan review and class two adjustment for a residential uh Care Facility the order of today's proceeding will be a staff report that will be presented by City staff followed by the applicant's presentation which will limit to 15 minutes a neighborhood report which will limit to 10 minutes and then we'll go to public testimony if anyone is appearing for that if any one present is going to testify we're going to ask you at that time to state your name and address so the mic picks it up for the record the public testimony will be heard in the following order first we'll start with testimony in favor of the application second we'll have a testimony that's neither in opposition or in favor of the application that's for evidentiary purposes third U testimony that would be in opposition and then the applicant will be allowed allowed five minutes to rebut any testimony that's made in opposition um the applicant Bears the burden of proof to show that the approval criteria can be satisfied by the facts and any opponent May rebut that the the permit by offering alternative facts or by showing that the evidence submitted does not satisfy the approval criteria this hearing is not a place to ask questions of staff the applicant or the hearings officer but it's an opportunity to provide the hearings officer with evidence on the merits of the case any person may request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony regarding the application and uh following the hearing and the hearings officer will make a ruling as to whether to continue the public hearing or whether to leave the record open for an additional period to receive written testimony or evidence at the end of the hearing at this point uh I will open the public hearing for case number CPR AJ 24-02 and I will direct everyone's attention to the criteria that were given in the notice this public hearing will be devoted to this criteria because those are the only things that are relevant to the decision that I must make so for a conditional use Salem code 24.005 D says that an application for a conditional use permit will be granted if all the criteria stated in that section are met and those are that the code allows the conditional use in the in the zone that uh the adverse impact in the neighborhood can be minimized and third that the development will be reasonably compatible with and have minimum impact on the livability and development of the surrounding property so we'll now open with the staff report good evening my name is Olivia Diaz I'm the current planning manager I'm here to present the case CU spr adj 242 for property located at 325 Lancaster Street I would like to enter this presentation the staff report the supplemental staff report and then there's a a testimony receiv received from the neighborhood association into the record so we're here to discuss a conditional use permit for residential care facility the site plan review for the site development which includes the parking um and private Street improvements and then an adjustment for reduction of firware landscaping and plant units along some of the property lines the subject property um is located off the Lancaster Drive Southeast um just at the intersection of 37th in Lancaster the subject property does have a private street that runs through it that's called Cinema way um so you can see the vicinity map shows the subject property the cinema way to the South is the CarMax um facility a movie theater and then to the um East is a Robert's High School there is a residential neighborhood to the north that's outside of the city limits um but is Zone residential have some aerial photos um looking or some street view photos looking at the private Drive there's a tampered on your right hand side that's a little notch in the subject property and the tavern and then the property is to the right of the where the four sale sign is this is the there's a driveway here and a driveway off the cinema way serving the property this is Cinema way looking East back Lancaster the subject property is owned CG General commercial uh and the comp plan is commercial OB retic property as you can see the property is surrounded by mostly CG and then the white area is outside of the city limits conditional use permit is addressed in your sack report um the proposed use is a conditional use permit in the zone the findings for personally um likely to um address adverse impacts is also addressed um in your sta report um the applicant has proposed mitigation from landscaping and setbacks um for the for the use against the residential property to help address these concerns so we have the site plan shown um on the site The Proposal is developing a much smaller area than the entire the entirety of the property due to Wetlands um and other development constraints this is a blown up version of the proposed site plan you can see the parking area to the east um and then the building and then their stor water facility to the West so for the site plan review there were several conditions of approval um that were addressed in the staff report related to you know locations of trees items that are meant to address the development standards and the code um there was a supplemental report addressing trash enclosure sorry there's a this in your staff report there is this uh parking lot in the circle in the red um that there is a condition of approval to add a jersey barrier to block the driveway connecting to the site at the tavern which um was ever permitted um so the existing that existing development was never of permitted use and to um alleviate the violation a jersey barrier in closing of the driveway is proposed as a condition are shown in yellow and then as part of the site plan review there's condition of approval related to the trash enclosure the supplemental report provided for either relocating the trash enclosure or obtaining a revokable license through our Public Works engineer since it's located within an East the East is shown in Blue on on your screen um there's also some trees that are located in that proposed trees that are located in that eement which um have been conditioned to be relocated to ensure that they meet the plant units and the adjustment Criterion uh but are to get them out of the easement event Who Remain so the revised conditions of approval that were in um the supplemental report for to address the reable license for the encro for the encroachment of the trash enclosure um to address some of the applicants concerns around timing for issuance of building permits um and access agreements um and then also provide an alternative sign off option for the storm water facility to be located on site instead of on the CarMax property uh we only received one comment from Maran County uh Maran County did comment that the the driveway approach On LAN cast would need to be um closed and the access from Cinema way would be the only access and we received a comment that wasn't to the record late from the Southeast Salem neighborhood association in support of the application staff recommends approval of the conditional use permit as outlined in both staff reports I'm available for any questions if you have let's see I uh let's see the other question I have is I saw the storm water so that the storm water that was on the plan facility that would be the alternative storm water fac now I can show you because otherwise it's going to be offside well so that the storm water facility that you're seeing on um that the greenstorm water facility is designed for for their site um but what we're discussing is that there is an outfall oh right here that's off site um and so there is the possibility that they redesign because the rest of the cinema way is on their property so there's two options there the alternative is to outfall here or come up with some other alternative on site but this storm water facility is required for code for green smart water okay you're welcome so that that completes the staff complet report so today do we have people who sign up for uh to give testimony all we first okay oh that's right sorry about that no go right ahead applicant it's your turn I do have it however you want to do it we over there you should be able to just I I'm my name is Hillary Harris I'm the appli representative I what's your address oh yeah 205 Southeast smoke Street Port so first a little bit about organ Community for Solutions um they partner with state and local governments um to solve Community problems um throughout the state of Oregon so specifically they're committed to addressing for against Behavioral Health uh crisis by building psychiatric treatment infrastructure and a big part of this is building more secure residential treatment facilities that provide a sa alternative to work against state so that's what best facility uh so the project location is 325 Lancaster Drive Southeast um you have already seen me so to go to into them but uh there's commercial to the south and east of the site in Roberts High School to the west and then kenal zoning to so this is a map of the existing ements and the wetlands on the project site so the private Drive is to the South has an access e then the other red portions are either access e or public utility e and then the wetlands are shown so as you can see it's right restricted building areas um so the proposed development is going to be 11, Feats um of building area there'll be 16 beds in the facility and there'll be a parking lot with 23 parking spaces and RightWay dedication and improvements on Landcaster drive as well as improvements on the private Street and connections and then this is the this is the blown up version and then this is how it's located on the so then approval criteria for site plan review is that the application needs all applicable standards code and setback building fights Etc and the application materials we submitted we demonstrating that we um are meeting them with the proposed designer they can be condition to then conditional use is addition use forg listed and then um the construction of the residential care facility will have minimal impacts to the existing new and surrounding properties um and",

electric buses for an amount not to exceed the 12,756 and I can answer any questions you have hopefully okay any right so would anyone like to make a motion are you're looking at me okay cool I'd love to make a motion uh I move that the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract with gillig for the purchase of 10 40ft battery electric buses for an amount not to exceed 15 second awesome we have a motion at a second and is there any discussion on this motion yes Dr Davidson thank you president um I I wasn't sure if I wanted to phae this as a question but I'll I'll just make it as a a comment you really undersold yourself here um you saved the district $1.5 million and you got the buses here not only on time but possibly ahead of schedule by with the relationship that you have like you just thank you like you and whoever else was involved in this that is really really impressive you you saved this I mean this could have been a nine bus order functionally and it could have been at least another year uh I was when we got these funds I was expecting 2025 at the earliest uh and this is just fantastic so um thank you and yeah and to any of the federal delegation we're spending the funds please keep giving us more money we will buy more buses and we will buy them quickly Al righty uh yes director hold ask yes uh director sorry uh president he knows PR may ask a question uh sure let's thank you so um just curious did we use the same uh procurement the same price agreement for the the processes we have on property now I'm just curious we actually did so so on in both the Lono grants we're able to actually in the grant award name partners and that in that in those circumstances uh constitutes the procurement right however when we go out when we went reach out to gilig they based their pricing off of the Washington State pric agreement because they've already negotiated the the lowest cost for that that they use Statewide for for both Oregon and Washington great yeah appreciate that thank you um so just so that everyone's on the same page we have 10 buses that are we purchased before they're on the property now correct and then this would be the ne next 10 so this would be a total of 20 altogether that is correct correct um we're going to use at some point when we have all of the infrastructure put together later this year hopefully we'll have buses running on Route 11 correct that is correct cor and you're stealing my show for the next part I'm sorry you're stealing my you're fine I'm you know what I'll ask these next my next question is the next time thank you very much thank you great work all right all those in favor please say I I I I any opposed seeing none motion passes unanimously and then I guess we'll just see it right up general manager Pollock maintenance manager Thompson are we able to load the all right well good evening uh president hos PR pressy and members of the board good to see you tonight I will be giving a presentation on where we're currently at with our battery electric bus project uh I want to first start off with thanking Chief Operating Officer Tom Deets for doing the last presentation in my absence and there there will be several updates and some of them are as fresh as of today because things are moving pretty quickly so just a a quick recap um the work occurring today is is the spending of the 2020 and 2021 loan no grants uh there are additional grants that are that will provide even more buses and more Chargers most recently the ones you just approve five minutes ago the we have I say that this is kind of a it's a large project it includes numerous steps um nearly I think not nearly I think every single Department in the organization is involved Finance procurement security maintenance I mean everybody is involved it's it really takes a a village to make this happen this is included for this first step it's included 19 different contracts and multiple board approvals uh throughout the course of the last couple of years uh and it also has been a fantastic partnership with the vendors that are listed on on the the page there gilig obviously is the manufacturer of the buses they've been a fantastic partner for both building the uh the uh training we just had our fourth round of training conclude today for the maintenance staff uh they've been very good helping us with that cumins does the propulsion and the the batteries they've been a great they're a great partnership with us and gillig in the communication for those uh CTE is the center for Transit and the environment and they're and Consulting through the areas that were especially the ones that were unknown to the district at the time such as charger selection charge management route validation and project organization PGE has been a massive help especially in coordination with their Fleet partner program at Kaiser Transit Center uh because of them uh they they handled most all of the engineering most all of the construction uh offset some of our costs which actually allowed us to purchase the third inductive charger in one of those Bays so it was really a a help and they've done fantastic work out there uh induct TV which is formerly momentum Dynamics uh they doing the inductive chargers at Kaiser they've been great Partners uh and we'll go we'll go through here in just a little bit on what the status update and where where they are at in their process and then wrapping up at Kaiser with JH Kelly JH Kelly uh we enlisted to come out and they did the cabinet placement they did the pulling of the the conduit into the charging stations in in the ground into the cabinets they did the high voltage connections the low voltage connections and the fiber optic cabling uh M McDonald has been played a key role in at our D web location uh with the project engineering electrical engineering plan sets designs and bid documents uh so they really had offer that technical expertise charge point is the the vendor that we chose to do the uh Depot charging so there's dispensers charge blocks uh they've been uh fantastic working with uh our vendors to make sure everything's installed and constructed correctly and then I kind of Saved ec electric for for last they have been uh out there in the rain in the snow doing the the all of the construction at Del Web uh they have done some amazing things they have worked with us and they have really saved uh with their expertise and their foresight uh have really helped us work through some issues they've been Ina they've been patient with us while issues have Arisen and they through their foresight have actually helped us navigate around what would have been other issues so they've been just a great partner for us um we have uh for this project we have bi-weekly meetings that the vendors are all on and we're doing status updates and what's neat is for example at Kaiser uh PGE induct EV everybody had each other's contacts so there was conversations and discussions and progress happening outside of the meetings so it wasn't they weren't relying on me to facilitate the communication they were coming up with resolution so when we would meet they would say oh yeah we talked about this and this is this is how we're going to proceed same thing happened at at Dell web Salem electric I I don't know hopefully I didn't miss them so they're going to be doing the uh transform transformation uh and doing the final connections here so it's really been uh a great partnership and I think everyone's aligned with what the the end goal is for this project so where are we at so far it's there's been a lot of happening the at ktc the construction is complete the Transformers and switch gear are have power they're energized uh the induct EV cabinets are installed and wired uh unfortunately the downside was during during the installation of those it was found that the coolant hoses and the special connectors for those didn't show up with the all the multi crates for the order and they were a custom order from Switzerland they are actually supposed to be here tomorrow which is fantastic uh induct evv will be back out on January 30th they'll they'll finish installing the charge pads and the charge pads in this picture they're blue and orange those are just construction cover plates essentially uh the coil s that will set on top of that are still out of DB so next week they'll they'll finish their connections and set the actual charge pads in into each of those square holes where the electrical are the the buses themselves are in order to communicate with the Chargers need a software update uh we were waiting a little bit while the that software was actually being built uh it's now now done complete tested and cumins is is is in charge of doing that update there're supposed to be out on site next week to uh do that software update February 5th I think hopefully this is knock on wood if everything goes as planned if everyone does the things that they're supposed to do and all the parts show up February 5th we'll be doing a walkth through with PGE and the vendors for the kind of the final in section of Kaiser Transit Center it should be live at that time it should be ready to go and I'm planning on that day to start rolling buses through Kaiser to have each bus connect with each charger just to make sure that it's statically operates before we start our route validation so couple weeks we're going to be looking very promising there the we move moved to D web and where we're at so Dell web has seen a lot of changes and there's a ton of pictures Tom Tom has done a great job with being the photographic historian of the daily updates on on what's happening there uh right now ec electric today they just finished their work so at Del Web we have all 12 dispensers standing uh all of the power blocks which one power block uh controls two dispensers all of the power blocks are in they're wired to each other uh we have so the 10",

        "text": " public comment do we have anyone in the room that wishes to provide public comment to the council that's good come on forward if there's anyone in the room that wishes to provide public i saw your hand first you might as well come up first yes thank you so just try to speak all right uh my name is norman simone i live here in la grande oregon and uh thanks i would like to thank the council for coming here for their thank you very much hi hanley i understand that the council are regulators working within the framework i would ask you now to start thinking that framework in the future uh it's going to change dramatically we should have started on this 20 years ago i think that's become abundantly clear to everyone given what we're now seeing with the kind of destructive changes in the climate regime across the planet the way this is now rolling is with the development finally of serious talk about a changing and uh now with the passage of the inflation reduction act what we have is an entire suite possibilities that will literally turn the good upside down and that is what i am here to address specifically um one of my questions for quite a while has been and it is something that i did bring over to the uh continuing commission one like revenues for quite a while and what happens when you start is it too loud what happens when you start essentially providing distributed generation hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of locations it's a difficult question it's also one that's now been tackled by some professional modelers and what we have is a situation where essentially power and ancillary services can be delivered in a way that can save upwards of a half a trillion dollars in about 25 years the work has been and i will pass this on to the council the work has been done finally to figure out what the grid starts to look like when you turn it upside down and what it looks like is something vastly different than what we have right and because of that the business models that have been used over the years ensure that rural electrification would take hold have rapidly become quite obsolete what we're looking at is a situation where there will be digital controls digital control surface smart meters smart inverters essentially providing the services and the power necessary on an as needed basis literally with software running in the background that will essentially provide a market at the real-time production of those services and the energy itself that has the effect of essentially turning the grid completely upside down and reworking local demand long distance demand finally we have a way to start to approach this but of course what we're looking at is the economic inertia that's built into the existing models a very difficult situation we need to turn the grid around essentially the decisions that are going to have to be made about the grid will look a lot more and local than they will say over long distance that particular analysis which hanley is looking through right now is just revolutionary uh it's a completely new way of thinking about how we're going to get our power one of the problems we have and it's a huge one is that the utilities uh have never thought about how they might uh essentially price and buy services from their uh customers and by that i mean they're residential and commercial customers because that's where this is going to go what this shows quite clearly is that essentially putting in rooftop solar not just the very large ones but rooftop solar which is the best place we could possibly put this stuff in because we already have those surfaces we don't have to cover ground we don't have to essentially impact the ecology instead what we can do is essentially start using what we've got which is people's rooftops of course that's exactly what is now being incentivized in the bill that was just passed it's revolutionary the details are just amazing in that bill it's going to change everything and so from the point of view of the kind of regulatory framework that the council now works under um that's probably going to be completely turned upside down in any case i did want to bring that so that you can at least start to take a at what i think is one of the most important analyses that's been done one that finally starts to model the delivery of services and power what will be as i said literally tens of thousands of locations thank you for your time thank you norm i didn't get your last norm could you give us your last name thank you i live with 1208 first street i was a systems analyst for the u.s forest service thank you my name is anne march i live at 206 maine avenue here in le grand and thank you for being here for making this trip out here many of you probably came from the portland area drove on i-84 and that's what i'm going to talk about today for a few minutes i happened to go that way last thursday i hadn't done that in a long time i got to boardman guess what i saw a lot of new construction of power lines maybe you saw it too there's always been a lot there there is a lot more there are tall power lines short power lines power lines of all shapes sizes going every direction it's horrific it's ugly and if boardman ever wants to promote tourism good luck i thought they're thinking how did this happen how could this happen well it's morrow county lack of planning it also may involve fsec i don't know it may involve oregon department of energy i don't know but it's not visionary now when you contrast this to our beautiful state and for example we have open beaches that can't be developed that was because of visionary leadership we have land use planning that's restrictive not always popular but due to visionary leadership has preserved our state in a way that the state i come from doesn't have that and it's developed all over so we have some great things in place in oregon this this cannot be a failure of ours to be looking at in such a way that creates the kind of blight that you see as you drive around so there's a general comment so my feeling is please think about being visionary please think about varying power lines please think about promoting projects that promote rooftop solar as i drove past boardman and the acres and acres of there were no solar panels on those roofs in sight that makes me sick we obviously need exit we need lines we all use power but we need to be looking at upgrading existing lines and not increasing our human footprint all over this beautiful state of ours so those are my comments thank you very much for listening thank you ms marsh are there others in the audience that uh would like to provide public comment come on forward hello my name is joe horst uh i live right up here on 86 hawthorne drive um i just wanted to make i just i'm kind of making an observation um between and and i'm not i'm not real up on how a lot of this works but i've noticed that um when it comes i understand that you know the oregon department of energy and the they need funding and that's important to them and i totally get that and but sometimes it's just i kind of get the impression that maybe the funding uh takes the front seat to the citizens of oregon as opposed you know and i think that sometimes it's they you know the citizens of oregon seem to get a back seat you know to the funding and i think it's uh sometimes some of these things are pretty important to us and i just think that uh that the council and the and the um department should maybe just take you know give us a little more consideration and and realize the funding is very important but uh maybe not as important as we are sometimes so that's all i got to say thank you thank you for your comment others interested in testifying or providing public comment thank you all for being here and i'm really glad that you've come to this side of the state my name is sandy ryman i live at 604 m avenue and ryman is spelled r-y-m-a-n if you need that i really want to pick up on a comment which ann march had made about potentially burying the lines and uh if you folks decide that this project is really needed really something you need to go through then i think that buried lines becomes important important ever since this project started i've been really relied on the university of pittsburgh website because they have a school of electrical engineering at the university of and they have a center for energy and the grid institute at the swansea school of engineering but both they and the u.s department of energy have noted that severe weather and climate change is the leading cause of grid disturbance particularly at the distribution level that it causes very by region and veg weather vegetation vegetation management and other management practices can really impact what occurs with electrical lines and there are certain regions of the country which are typically affected by weather events and the regions of the country which are severely affected are the pacific northwest california and texas and i think if you guys just think back over the last few years you would agree that the department of energy has that over you know the west has really seen many outages due to lightning and and overall extreme wind and temperature can make a difference so there's five factors to be considered about lightning wildfires extreme cold extreme winds and vegetation growth and those are all factors that would contribute to long-term maintenance of these lines for idaho power i mean this is a clarification for everybody else you can certainly speak but but the public comment time period the proposed order and the proposed contested case order on this project are closed so thank you please do not speak specifically about this project i will not speak specifically about this project then i will talk about um you know that this is a relative weakness for building long distance high voltage electrical transmission lines due to those factors that i have just noted and that's the main thing that i wanted to say is i would like to look at a consideration strong consideration that if this project were to go ahead that there would be a look at using the public right-of-way access along the uh interstate system to bury these lines rather than having them be submitted subjected to the uh changes that occur weather-wise in this okay that's what i wanted to know thank thank you for your comments ms ryman are there others who would like to comment good morning and thank you um my name is margaret l mead i live at foothill road",

        "text": " so you can see the location of the project so you can see at the top where the city of Boardman is um and then the um blue area with the big border is the project location next please and then there's just a zoomed in picture of that next slide please so uh essentially where we're at is um again appointing a hearing officer and since 2017 Council has utilized uh administrative most agencies are obligated to use them you are exempt however they um do have the skills expertise and Staffing to provide the service and so since 2017 you've elected to appoint administrative law judges for this purpose uh you can see in the last bullet um the projects where that has occurred so Council has appointed hearing officers um for all of those projects next slide please and so um the manager for the Oregon office Administrative Hearings has put forward kriana as the proposed hearing officer for the this project um she has previously been the hearing officer for the Nolan Hills Power project she is Oregon bar certified uh she has done work on numerous state agencies and boards and commissions uh in terms of doing contested cases she has a jur doctorate from Lam University and a bachelor's degree in Psychology from University um we're very happy with her prior work on behalf of council and so getting to the very last slide staff's recommendation is that you do appoint her obviously you have the other recommendation or the other opportunity which is to not appoint her in which case we would reach back out to the Oregon office of administrative hearings so with that I will going to move to the next slide you are at the council deliberation and then the final slide is Council decision nope sorry Council Liberation thank you so that I'll turn it back over to you Mr chair thank you um any comments or discussion chair how councelor hes thank you I just was curious because it's the first time I've seen this on the agenda um um thank you for that background on that and I was pretty brief or so if you want me to go back and go over anything we were running a little bit long on the agenda so I tried to be very um quick on this one right I was just a little confused about how when it IT deemed when is it deemed worthy to do this because obviously it hasn't been done on every project um so that's where I was like H how does that work the timing varies uh and so right when we get a preliminary application we could do it at that point um all the way up until just at the point where we're issuing the draft proposed order so it it does happen on every application it's just a matter of when it happens within that application time frame on an amendment there is not an mandatory contested case like in an application Okay so we've been dealing with the Amendments recently which is why only if Council determines um that a contested case needs to be held would we go and seek um appoint ointment of a hearing officer but for applications it happens every time it's just a matter of sort of when along the sequence of that application process we bring it before Council okay thank you okay do we have a motion councelor delin oh I wasn't trying to anyway Mr chair I move that the council appoint administrative law judge Kate Triana from the Oregon office of administrative hearings is the hearings officer for the proceedings for the Sunstone solar project as recommended by staff thank you okay do we have a second this is councelor Byer second okay we've got a motion in a second secretary KET could you please call the role and Byer yes Richard develin I Marcy Grail yes Ken how yes Katie yes motion carries Mr chair okay thank you um so now yes uh this is Marcy obviously I have audio and I just wanted to say thank you for uh moving the agenda item uh to accommodate my issue thank you you bet um Mr chair if I may yes so it's 11 40 we have lunch now yeah um I had built in we're running a little bit long on the agenda I had built in within the next agenda item that you would just take a break when you're ready for lunch you could do that now you could wait um and you know initiate the next agenda item and then partway through that um stop it it's really whatever your choice is it's now a good time I think's a good time so we'll go ahead and yeah sir delin uh yes Mr chair that would be fine uh I don't know what other people need but 15 minutes would be adequate for me for a break for lunch yes we'll take 15 to grab the lunches and then we'll start back lunch with the Boardman to him andway request for Amendment so 15 that'll be okay I'm going to call us back into order here it's um noon and um the next item is the bouran to hway request for Amendment two Council review of the draft proposed order the information item and Kellen tardy weather senior sighting analyst will walk us through this all right uh and this is on okay uh good afternoon afternoon now on the DOT for the record Kellen tardy weather senior sighting analyst Oregon Department of energy I am going to be presenting council's review of the draft proposed order comments received on the DPO and responses the certificate holder responses to those comments the certificate holder is Idaho Power um representatives from Idaho Power are here in the room as well as um as their um some of their legal um assistance and then I also want to thank uh Irene Gilbert for heading over the M and and traveling to come to our meeting today we always appreciate attendance um and to the other member of the public uh Miss small party weather over there I'm glad that she's here and thank you everybody for anything that will unfold um so opening remarks um our job is hard right at here at Odo in the sighting division we do some really hard work um your job is hard Council and you have to process a lot of information for a lot of different facilities and it's it's all very hard um and I know that for each council meeting we have specific agendas when you make decisions it's on a specific project or a specific specific topic however it's really important to understand that nothing that we do is done in a vacuum everything the value in the work in the sighting division is uh connecting the dots in between projects decisions rule making understanding um you know when we do the same thing for a project why when we do something different and why um so I'm I'm giving these remarks because I'm going to through my presentation today I'm going to be trying to connect the dots um with different aspects of of you know this project but but elsewhere as well um and I think that uh at the May 30 uh inperson hearing uh on the DPO and then your council meeting on the 31st is actually it was those were big meetings there was a lot of information that was heavy but it was really cool because the next day we're were um undergoing your contested case rule making so I want I want to like just keep that rule making in mind keep the you know when we talk thresholds and rules just like we're we're we're connecting the dots and applying them um you know I'm going to talk about them for this project but we're going to try to think holistically about the work that we do in the sighting division um because I am going to be like referencing and talking about some other projects so um now let's go all right so this is our Chevron slide uh we see this for all of our projects it's just to uh give you a general sense you just listen to the uh uh Chase McVey Walker's uh Council review of the DPO for an application for site certificate you can see that we're pretty much same process steps for an amendment um one of the primary differences in between an application and amendment is an application has an automatic contested case and for amendments a type A Amendment There's an opportunity to rec a contested case and that comes later um what are we talking about we're talking about a transmission line um about approximately 300 miles 500 KB uh transmission line about 273 miles in in Oregon and that's um you know it's an interesting metric there because we keep on adding in Alternatives which is what we're talking about today however you know it's a around 275 miles depending on the final design of the facility um and the transmission line also includes related or supporting facilities the vast majority of what of what we talk about with those are roads um there's a lot of Roads associated with this project now and that was um in the application for site certificate and then in the request for Amendment one and I know this doesn't have a lot of detail in it um but so the map on our left those are the Alternatives that were approved in the application and then request for Amendment one there were four minor route changes along the line that were proposed as Alternatives so these are basically the approved facility includes kind of your one main approved route and then a myriad of all of these Alternatives basically so that upon final design Idaho Power can select which route they're going to choose um which I forgot my opening remarks um uh at the end of this you know I have the council deliberation slide at the end of this presentation but this is intended to be an interactive presentation so because we are we've got so many comments covering a lot of topics just stop me if you have a question and let's just answer it um I can also I'm I am and for anybody watching online or listening on the telephone I'm running the presentation from my computer but um and what I usually do during our presentation is I'll leave the PowerPoint and we can pull up we can pull up the DPO the site certificate Maps we can we can look at stuff so I want to make make that clear so if you have have questions you want to clarify anything uh just just stop me and we will go there um so this is our procedural history um a couple notes on that at the hearing on the DPO there was a request um to extend the comment deadline because it wasn't evident we would be limiting the time uh in our notice so and again we always are trying to improve improve and be responsive so we're now in our notices for uh council meeting agendas we're going to provide a you know stipulation if there's going to be hearings",

transmission lines the 230kv gentile lines and those are the lines extending out of the site boundary next slide so again this is another kind of overview of where we're at this is our procedural history so as i mentioned before the applicant filed a notice of intent they did this back in 2017. then the preliminary came in and originally it was only for wind and that was filed in february of 2020 and through that iterative process that i explained of requests for additional information that they respond to and revise preliminary application they also expanded the project design to solar pv to the wind so now it's a wind and solar project and by the time the application for site certificate they also included the bus and the transmission line so the whole project became what we reviewed in the final for site certificate which we didn't complete on january 31st of this year and as i noted before the department issued the draft proposed order on april 19th and we are now in the red the red highlighted area of our public hearing and the next steps will be uh tomorrow if it moves forward tomorrow we will review with council as an information item on your agenda for for more comments and questions and then the next phase would be the proposed order the notice of contested case and then a final decision next slide so to emphasize the public participation phase at the dpo level part of the as i noted before once we issued the dpo it it started the public comment process so we've been receiving comments since that date and it's open to the public to participate in various so some comments can be you know you can mail your comment you can email your comment we have a new public comment that is on our odo webpage that you can enter your comment online and then it instantly becomes part of the official record and it's publicly available for for other people to see it you can fax it to us you can have it fedex to us there's a lot of different ways and tonight the public hearing is just to provide people with the opportunity to be here in person and provide oral testimony or oral comment and also for the alj to hold the public slide so we have people calling in people that may be online through our as well as in the room and we will go through uh a process for calling on everybody that we will explain in so i just wanted to give some kind of framework for for making a comment um and and what it means to be as part of the contested case so in order to be a participant in contested case you need to get your comments on the and you can do that during the public comment period once the public comment period closes we don't accept any more input that would relate to being in a contested case for consideration in a contested case um precedent has showed us that issues need to be raised sufficient specificity so that council and the department and the applicant can understand the issue and are afforded the opportunity to and there will be a point in the in the hearing where the applicant will be able to do that tonight um and to raise an issue with sufficient this the person making the comment needs to present facts to support their next slide this slide is basically to kind of give you a guidance if you're interested in making a comment of how to make an effective comment to the record and what is probably less so making sure that you're tying your specifically to our citing standards which is what we're following in our and to the oregon administration administrator rule the oars and our standards being specific about whether or not you think a standard has been met and why is basically what what is an effective comment you if you can state supporting facts submit alternative or informational material that you think supports those facts and then it's particularly helpful for us if you can reference the specific pages if you taking issue with something specifically in the draft proposed order or the application itself less effective is basically staining your position without providing any supporting information as to why you who are taking that position or maybe submitting information without making us aware of what it's referencing or what it's being supporting of i think those are and raising issues that are clearly outside of our jurisdiction or our process or making what are basically unsubstantiated comments which is to fail to provide any backup support or documentation for what you're saying so that and that is just a guidance on how to participate and make effective next slide so at this point i am going to turn it to our administrative law judge who is kate triana and she is with the office of administrative hearings in and she is our council appointed hearing officer so this juncture i am going to quit talking and i am going to turn it over to the alj so kate i am turning it over to you okay great but thank you kathleen uh so as uh we've mentioned this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the application for a site certificate for the nolan hills wind power project and i am kate triana i'm a senior administrative law judge at the oregon office of administrative and i've been appointed as the f-sec appointed hearing officer in this matter uh we're sometimes referred to as hearing officers sometimes aljs or administrative law judges um and so i'm serving as the presiding officer for this hearing today uh it is may 26 2022 the time is currently 5 56 pm uh pacific time and just to get on the record uh this public hearing is being held at the energy facility citing council or fsec it's in person at the red lion hotel located in pendleton oregon but it is a hybrid hearing so it's also being held via webex webinar with a call-in option for those who can't participate in person or via webex so the purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies and the to present oral and written testimony on the nolan hills wind power project for certificate and draft proposed order the 37-day record of the public hearing comment period on this draft proposed order is scheduled to close today at the conclusion of this hearing unless we discuss otherwise during the so at the conclusion of uh my brief presentation today we're gonna call on each person interested in providing oral testimony and i say we because kathleen's going to help me with calling on the people who are in person and so we're going to start though with some oral testimony or presentation by the applicant i understand they also have a a powerpoint they're going to present at that point then we'll take public comments from people who are in person um at the hearing there in pendleton uh then we'll take anyone who's on the webex webinar and then finally we will follow up with so just looking over it looks like kathleen had told me there are about five people um at the meeting who want to testify or provide comment seven okay and it looks like we have a number of people on the phone i don't know if on the phone is planning to testify or provide comments but i think based on the the number of people i am going to set a time limit for comments today um i'm going to set a five minute per comment time limit um and so then each individual will be allotted five minutes department staff are going to track the time for each commenter um and i think you'll be able to view it on the webex also to see how much time you had or have and how much time is um if your time ends and you're still speaking i'm gonna kind of jump in and try and uh have you wrap it up just so that we can transition to the next speaker i want to make sure we get through all the today so please try and be respectful of the allotted time and any other speakers if i have to ask any clarifying questions or if a council member asks a clarifying question of the commenters the time will be stopped for the question and response period and then restarted to allow the commenter to have the full time and i think this has already been mentioned but just so everyone's aware this is being recorded uh the presentations the written comments and the oral testimony will all become part of the decision record uh for the proposed facility if we could um pull up on the hearing on the power point i believe there's a slide that corresponds to this we get the powerpoint pulled back up if we can't it's okay perfect okay okay so pursuant to oar three four five zero one five zero two two zero subsection five a and b um everyone needs to note the following a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested must raise the issue in person at the or in a written comment submitted to the department of energy before the deadline stated in the notice of the public a person who intends to re a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the applicant an adequate opportunity to respond including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the um and so when when i say in person that includes anybody participating in webex or by phone all right so if we can move to the next slide please so to raise an issue in a contested case proceeding the issue must be first within the jurisdiction of the it needs to be raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the record of the public comment period which uh unless discussed otherwise will be at the close of this hearing today may 22nd and it must be raised with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the applicant an adequate opportunity to respond um and to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that the support that support the person's position on the issue um so if we could go to the next slide so we'll probably put this back up the comment period after the applicant does their presentation but just so everyone's aware prior to testifying today or making your comment we need everyone to state the following your full name with the spelling of your name if you're with some sort of organization or group that you're representing please say the name of the organization or group if you are also representing an organization or organization or group please let us know",

        "text": " elsewhere um that could help inform us so because you know it's we don't want to reinvent the wheel either on things that um good ideas that are coming elsewhere from elsewhere so just another thought on that yeah absolutely we've had some really good prison in the past from Washington and California on work that are happening in those two states and those are the ones that are coming to mind that I I remember us digging in on but I'm sure there are a lot of other presentations that we've had in in past meetings from time to time that I have been I think really beneficial we have a couple more minutes for this any other reactions to these kind of broader discussion questions commissioner rietman uh here I guess that uh I'm wondering how to incorporate the comments that I'm receiving from the commodity organizations and and it's related to the Natural and working lands uh committee work which has done very well I might add and I'm very pleased with what they're doing so I I just want to make sure we don't alienate uh you know a whole sector of of uh producers in the state because we didn't listen to them at the get-go so just just a reminder that and I thought the comment that that Lisa made about every everybody wants to be recognized for what they're doing and what they're contributing and I thought that was important to keep in mind too absolutely and I I you know we we have through the process included commodity groups but um certainly that's that's something we want to do on an ongoing basis and and make sure we're being responsive to those concerns to any concerns they might have or just a knowledge that they're aware of that would would benefit us and I I've assured them that that the Oregon Global commission wants to be inclusive of everybody and that we don't intend to alienate others including the the mainline organizations absolutely yeah thank you other reactions I guess the the one last thing uh you know working on this work plan and developing the draft might be one of those things that a subcommittee could really help with um so I I'll confer with Zach but uh might be you know let do let us know if you would be willing to be on a subcommittee I think we'd be looking at trying to yeah a draft or a subcommittee to review early in July in order to be able to post it early enough for a mid to late July Commission meeting to um to review it and so I don't want to commit to a um just in case that puts uh Zach in in a bind in terms of uh being able to kind of take what he's heard and uh and develop it out but um but do let us know and and then once I confer I'll reach back out to those who might be interested in participating and uh developing that draft which I would anticipate would be maybe one follow-up um to be able to kind of dig in and react to some some of what Zach and I might put together okay with that I think we need to go to public comment and so um Stacy and Zach uh can you give us a sense of how many people want to sign up um public comment I'm just looking at the list and I don't see any hands yet so if uh just as a reminder if folks want to meet public comment uh you should see a smiley face down at the bottom and then a hand next to it and so if you just raise your hand uh hit that button that'll help us or if you have something in the chat uh or if you put something in a chat that you'd like to uh jump in and discuss that'll help us um hear it from the Public Utility uh yeah um I figured I'd take this opportunity to kind of jump back to the climate pollution reduction Grant discussion and I wanted to emphasize that I think uh Colin engineering did a great job with a kind of presenting their overview of the plan uh the PC just really wanted to to Second what they are in this case maybe third uh what they were saying with regard to the need to uh Focus initially on making sure that any funding kind of gets directed towards existing plans um and and achieving kind of the existing state goals that the um that Oregon already has that are really intended to to move uh towards decarbonizing the economy um you know as has been noted um here by a number of parties uh there's a lot of work that's already um you know the PGE as was noted at the beginning of this meeting uh just submit their cep and as part of that they have a number of goals around community-based renewable energy energy storage and those types of projects are going to be critical to seeing the state kind of achieve its decarbonization goals and as was noted by commissioner after I think another key area that's going to require a lot of collaboration and proactive work is really and ensuring that federal funds are secured wherever possible um whether it's transmission renewable energy development new technology development there are a number of different elements that will need to be invested in in order to achieve uh the state's broader policy objectives and so yeah the PC is looking forward to both creating venues and working within other agencies and parties venues to really communicate around this and um develop kind of comprehensive plans that can be implemented in in Foster further decarbonization going forward great thank you Garrett has anyone signed up for public comment yes Terry McDonald uh Pat delaquil is great other hand welcome Pat welcome can you hear me yes oh great um with regards to the policy topics I think your guiding principle really needs to be uh creating a state vision because unfortunately many of our Regulatory and even legislative processes get siled and we have one set of activities for our electricity sector one for gas and I think the importance of the commission is to be able to look across the sectors and and try to create a state goal a state plan build consensus around that help coordinate those activities and I think if there's one specific area that you could really dig into and and to help create some some consensus is to is to dig into this area of the full social accounting of our climate impacts that not just the health but the community benefits the economic benefits of addressing it properly Etc and I think that stronger accounting going Beyond just the um you know the social cost of carbon to try to quantify it for oregonians would really be a big step forward so thank you thank you very much for your comments Zach are there others that have signed I don't see any other hands at the okay well then I will ask a question about the um I Colin you mentioned that um Metro did not have the same deadline for submitting uh proposal do you know the deadline that that Metro is under what if any process they're using to get input from the public on what they propose are you still with us caller Janine can you jump in on that uh thanks chair McDonald I think Colin had to jump off um and I don't recall the uh deadline for Metro maybe Zach does but we can certainly get back to you if if he doesn't remember yeah sorry I think it's the end of this month um and I see that uh Whitney's hand is raised and she may be able to provide a bit more detail on this question so if we can unmute her that'd be awesome can you hear me yes okay great welcome yeah I stopped hinting for her calling he had to he had to take off for a second but um I wanted to share that we've been in yeah close communication with Metro um as they've been developing their application and it is due on the 31st um and there is a plan moving forward to stay connected to the work that they're doing and align with their engagement so ensuring we aren't asking folks to try and engage um you know both on the state's plans separately from Metro's plan but rather uh the state will you know go to and participate in engagement opportunities that Metro is planning to host and so conversations have started there and we will continue to update you all um on that front too great thank you and I um I I hadn't realized that the metro area would include Vancouver as well so is it can I assume that um there's good coordination on that front between the Oregon side of the metro area and the Washington side yeah that's a good challenge for Metro to um and they do have uh you know know their their networks already existing in close partnership but um I know that they are as well reaching out to the Washington State um leads on the cprg grant because there's just so many levels of kind of coordination here and um it's a little bit of just a sticky way that um the the boundaries were drawn I think for the MSA and how to navigate this so um they are looping in with Vancouver great thank you I was really pleased to hear how many states submitted Grant in work that I've engaged in with my day job with the US climate Alliance it seems like most climate action plans have been focused in states that are part of the alliance um and so being which is 25 and taking that out to 46 uh you know it shows kind of the power of being able to make this kind of a grant opportunity available for states that might not otherwise be able to participate or um motivated to participate without it so that's that was very encouraging to hear yeah and there's one other piece I'll share which is that there is a climate innovation and team aspect of this grant where EPA will be facilitating conversations nationally and regionally just to align the states who are working on specific pieces within their priority climate action plan and comprehensive so um it could be a really great way for us um yeah just work alongside others and learn from others as we are all navigating this together great I know there's been a lot of value in that with the US climate Alliance states of kind of comparing notes and figuring out how to go through this together so that's great to hear that EPA is going to do that any anyone else from the public stack brace your hand I don't see anyone at the moment okay any other comments from commissioners for the good of the order today I see Tom jumped on camera do you want to make a comment uh uh just quickly uh I I think moving forward you have a very aggressive work plan if everything comes through and especially if the legislative bills get passed where the global warming commission would be involved and so I I think it just need to recognize when",

        "text": " admit tax abatement on urban renewal centers is out of my technical depth but um we did have a very helpful prep meeting with the city and there are a few things I can clarify first this is this is actually a very small development project um and the the um I think that the right way to describe the income range is that because they are such small units they are accessible to a wide range of incomes larger development projects do have different standards and different expectations around the proportion of the units that are reserved ex expressly for low income housing this project is different that way it doesn't have the same um requirements because it's so small in scope the baat itself is good for 10 years but the If This Were a larger project If This Were were one at the scope that this board has contemplated in the past it's governed by a city statute that um designates the expectation around the proportion of lowincome housing um within the project and the duration um of that expectation we have to look at the number of years for you you yeah Hudson go ahead thank you so um so say it's 10 years uh maybe review it's a batement I was curious though when you said seven residential two commercial units mle tip so the definition my comprehension is low-income housing so uh is it be and maybe I should not use meeting time for this because this probably uh reflects back to you um I was curious about the the law obviously it wouldn't be presented to us if it weren't checked first but where it stands as of today I was thinking that maybe it had to be all low-income housing uh for for this to be considered no no the multi program there are other programs for affordable housing or low-income housing but this program is specifically for revital revitalization of urban centers uh and providing multiple unit housing so that uh combined with uh both residential and Commercial spaces so that you can live and work in the downtown area okay so then uh thinking oh yeah we're going to pass it um so but I I am curious about a possible Clause between now and say 10 years if what kind of um accountability there is for the developer to not sell it and not uh kind of go backwards on the use of specified like low-income housing so are there any details am I making sense I can definitely add a lot of words I just don't want to I think some of those really detailed questions about the application of the statute might be we can provide you some more information of that okay since luckily we're coming back to this next time thank you and we have asked the um City staff responsible for administering this program to provide us a follow-up report on the status of the projects that you guys have approved over the last few years any information about I think the accountability that you're talking about they've offered to do that at your earliest convenience thank you um you know this has generated quite a bit of discussion the last time we were in this process director TR to agree the question of well if it doesn't you know if it's cost neutral for us then why does it come before us and at the same time I think recognizing that we have um a sense of responsibility also with the essentially power of of this approval right to um provide our input and um on the ultimate outcome of this so just of course want to support um housing and thinking about what ises affordable housing uh look like in our community where our students and Educators live so more to come we we'll see this again and I think if we have questions we can direct those to superintendent and uh Bob for more clarification we are think good on time so we have the information and standard reports any that we need to highlight for that no we do not have anything tonight we that's on the um for your review in your packet if you need it and that actually moves us right into our board reports which we have some time for so I would just encourage us to keep these uh comments brief and um I kind of want to start with their student advisers but I don't want to put you on the spot so if that's okay with you yeah and then we'll kind of move this way um some exciting things that are happening with in North that we are part of uh North just fundraised and was part of the uh School District with the Sam Kaiser District uh puller plunge which was super exciting we had like one of the biggest groups and we raised a lot of money and I think it's just really exciting to be part of that and just to see like everyone come together and I just really liked it and then we also had our Multicultural week assembly today to like honor the diversity and cultures within our school and I just I think North is such a beautiful school and there's just so many cultures and it just feels like a community and I think it's something to be proud of that a lot a lot of times it gets overlooked and I think I'm just really proud to attend North and these are just the reasons why uh since you guys want me to keep it brief I'm going to you don't have to I mean go for it go all yours okay um well last week at South I had the opportunity to talk to all of our sophomores about our IB Program um for for uh South 10th grade is the year to plan for IB and when I was in when I was in 10th Grade I was kind of like you know why would I ever want to do IB like why would I ever why would I ever want to put myself you know under so much pressure to do all this work and here I am a full IB diploma candidate and so I kind of just want to touch BAS on like a little bit about you know I like what I did um I basically talked to the sophomores about the benefits of IB so one in particular that I really like was that a lot of schools in Oregon have to give um college credits for the IB courses they take whether it's just a DB course or one or two whatever classes or a full diploma candidate which is six IB courses and the other core um things that they need to accomplish so one that really stood out to me for example was OSU which offers credits for specific classes and if you scored a 30 or above or above on all the IB uh exams you can get a 3,000 scholarship which is renewable for up to 3 years so like literally $112,000 for free because you took advantage of the IBU diploma program during High School um in addition to that a lot of students depending on their major I'm pretty sure they can be placed as a sophomore if they make if they have enough credits which saves them about $30,000 which I I think it's such a wonderful opportunity that South is able to offer such a rigorous uh Academic Program um but even though I was talking to the sophomores about you know hey like IB is right for you A lot of them gave me blank stairs or were rolling their eyes at me but you know what I feel like I did my best to give them you know the tools that they need to be able to make decisions for themselves and what they want to do within their last two years of high school um some things I talked to them about uh for the benefits of IB was was just having this Global um mindset you really like I feel like for most of the classes you kind of just think about what goes on in the US which I'm not against I'm not saying that but I feel like having a Global Perspective allows us to really think about why the world is the way it is like now in age um in addition to that we also have for the core we also need to Do complete creativity activity in service which uh gives us the opportunity to be well-rounded students so like for example um me being a student advisor here has given me the opportunity to hear different perspectives around the district which I mean when I think about like as an IB students like wow like I really you know like we have our perspectives here in the district but what about other districts around Oregon like what do they think how do they respond to certain um dilemas or actions or policies um on top of that we also have you have you also have to complete an extended essay of 4,000 Words which I mean it might sound like a lot for some of us I'm going to be real but but I feel like it's a wonderful opportunity to increase your uh research skills and argumentative writing um and one thing that I did notice though was I mean for my class at least there's a little there's a lack of Latin X voices in full IB so for my class of 18 seniors who are full diploma candidates only 11% of us percent of us are uh Latin X myself included however because we are introducing the career related program which only requires you to take two IB courses and one like career related um class I feel like that might increase the the um participation rates in IV courses of for Latino students and students of color um and because I won't you know I never had the opportunity to take that I hope that a lot of students get the understand The Importance of Being well-rounded and globally with a Glo and having a global thank you both and Patrick for like IB Ambassador no thank you and I and I I'm sure that you inspired and motivated some of those sophomores regardless of the they're just too they have to look right thank you director Richardson and then we can cue director Carson Cottingham if you're still with us just to good evening everyone um I just want to say Happy black History Month uh February is Black History Month I want everybody to know that black history is American history and black history is everyone's history I am black history I also want to uh just give huge thanks to Gerald Dean Hammond the first African-American Elementary principal here in Salem Kaiser uh has a school named after her uh also want to uh bring remembrance to the late Willie Richardson the first African-American School Board member here in Salem Kaiser the one who recruited me and on her deathbed when I told her that I thought I was going to run for school board she says you have my vote so uh she's was an excellent mentor to me uh and to others here in Salem Kaiser um I can't tell",

        "text": " portions of the facility added to the site boundary do those comply with the count with the laws and Council standards so that's that's really what we're looking at for this because we're adding areas to the site boundary and then for B you know this is a construction deadline extension so this is not what we're looking at here but this is just kind of to compare the questions a little bit different of what council is finding depending on the amendment and so really for a construction extension we're after considering like changes in fact or law that it the question is does that the facility complies with all Council standards um and then we we don't need to relay this too much and then so for any for a request for Amendment not described above then councils would be finding careful it'll stop there we go that the facility with the changes complies with the loss so there there is that I'm going to try to go back so I wanted to go through that I don't know if Council has any questions but I just think that that is um interesting and it helps guide um when when you're reviewing the draft proposed order that is the question that we ask ourselves and that is the framing of the findings in the order I'm gonna just because I'm not sure if there's a lag I might have to reshare so I'm going to stop and then or maybe I'll wait to go back to my PowerPoint presentation because it's not just bear with me thank you okay and then um so preponderance of evidence more likely than not um that the the information in the record supports this this finding um and then so just reiterating that the record for this project is very large it includes the application for site certificate final order contested case um and now it also includes rfa1 so voluminous record um for all amendments councils also required to find that the bond or letter of credit um is adequate the next slide next slide is our procedural history I don't need to belabor this too much um we got the preliminary RFA in December we're here in July um the record is scheduled to close at the end of this evening um in which case um whether it closes or not the next process step after the record closes is that Council will review the draft proposed order so the issuance of this is more of like kind of the process steps so the issuance of the draft proposed order as I mentioned it starts a comment period this has been a 34-day comment period um and it is it is um pertinent if if members of the public would like to proceed further or or reviewing agencies would like to proceed further in the process folks have to comment um while the record is open um so before the record closes at the end of the hearings by um mailing me a comment emailing me a comment we have an online portal where you can uh submit comments you can hand deliver them you could also provide oral testimony here in person or via the webinar or phoning in I'm going to continue on the next slide but it's critical that anybody who wants to participate further um comments on the record uh because Council cannot and will not um consider any comments that are submitted after the record closes they basically are not added to the record um the person so uh anybody that would like to participate or request a contested case proceeding must comment on the record of the DPO um and then for consideration in uh in a contested case request issues must be they have to be submitted within the time frame they have to be within council's jurisdiction um and they have to include sufficient specificity which means providing some sort of facts to support the position or um so with sufficient specificity with facts so that the council department and certificate holder can understand the issue and are afforded an opportunity to so where we um I'll build out a slide um because for for this project and for um a lot of uh folks who have followed this project um are well aware we had a very um long contested case process um on the application for site certificate and we do want to highlight that the threshold for a contested case on an amendment is different than it is for an application applications all applications have an automatic contested um for an amendment There's an opportunity to request a contested case and then here again the the question Council looks at if Council gets requests for contested case what what Castle's going to be looking at is you know does the issue provided in there well one did they meet all the criteria comment on the time frame sufficient specificity within the jurisdiction of the council but then council is going to ask itself that does the request raise a significant issue of fact or law that's reasonably likely to affect the council's determination of whether the facility with the change meets the applicable laws and then there's the scope of council's review that really the question in the DPO is that does the preponderance of evidence demonstrate that the portions of the facility added in the site boundary meet the applicable Council standards um secretary Cornett and our Communications team have put together just a 10 minute PowerPoint kind of going over the details of the request for contested case and the thresholds um and and the evaluation criteria that Council would look at that's available on our web page there's also a link to it in the public notice um now uh if Council gets a request for contested case the options that Council will do are to um hold a contested case on properly raised issues uh Council may also evaluate those requests for contested case and and um determined that there um properly raised issues that would Merit a change in the proposed order and they could remand that proposed order back to the department to then review or uh revise based on Council Direction and then Council can also deny the request for contested case so that that is my portion I'm going to pass it off to Vice chair how who's going to be the presiding officer for the hearing um just give us a little bit of time because Nancy I'm going to pass it back to you okay just a little bit of technical stuff here just there we go and vice chair health you have the four Ty weather the purpose of tonight's public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies

        "text": " this scenario a 16 foot multi-use path and reducing this one down to eight feet again just to show different options for the street cross section design this is these are the two conditions of approval that would be removed condition B3 and condition B4 won't go into detail on them but these are proposed to be struck from the approval and again this this is all in an effort to get the applicant out from working with Kinder Morgan and really being likely delayed significantly by Kinder Morgan approval and the approach is that the city will take on that negotiation and relocation of the line as part of our larger Ice Age tribe project and the main reason that makes sense is because Kinder Morgan and that line is going to impact not just this portion of the roadway the Kinder Morgan line continues off-site and is going to impact this portion of the roadway as well and also this Connector Road so instead of going through two different applications one from the applicant one from the city it just makes sense for the for the city to take the lead on and then the revised conditions of approval we worked pretty closely with the applicant on this legal council on both sides so um I won't go I won't read all of them or go through all of them but just to say that the way I can answer questions if you have any specific questions on them but um the intent here is to give the applicant certainty on the roadway alignment which is good that the Ura board just endorsed that alignment so give the applicant certainty that the right-of-way location is not going to change so they can move forward with building permits um give them certainty that they're not going to have to give get any type of approval from Kinder Morgan which would again result in delays clarifying that the city will take on that role and then from the city Side we wanted to make sure that we got the property in the correct manner being through the the correct type of deed so that we could right away start working with Kinder Morgan on the relocation and then making sure that we get the property in you know a short amount of time so that we can actually get those agreements down Kinder Morgan and actually get the road built so those are the those are the goals happy to answer any specific questions but a lot of attorneys looking at this over the last few weeks so we can answer any questions um one uh very specific but small change to the staff report originally we were thinking that the applicant would dedicate 56 feet of right-of-way and 20 feet of easement that was just a typo the what we're actually be proposing through the conditions is 76 feet of right-of-way's fee property and so in the final staff report or final findings we would correct that on the in the and with that staff recommends approval of the major modification as conditioned in the revised staff report dated February 7th 2023 and happy to take any does anybody have any questions of Staff before we call the applicant up yeah quick question so this is is this an easement are they actually deeding part of the property to the city be a deed through statue of libertarian okay statutory warranty deed okay got it that's to give the city the most flexibility in working with Kinder Morgan right off the bat and if we need to uh we would then dedicate part of that as an easement to Kinder Morgan so that Northern 20 feet would likely be dedicated to Kinder Morgan as an easement okay so it'll be city-owned property now and that's we can just negotiate that gives us the most flexibility as convenience and fee so what consideration is just part of the application process approval of the whole thing is this no monetary value this is changed the application at all in regards to like the building locations or any any other we're not encroaching any further it was always going to be 76 feet it was whether it was 56 and 20 and now it's just one combined of 76. correct okay I think the concern I mean the reason why we're doing all of this and the concern from the applicant not to speak for them but the concern from the applicant was that the the actual it's always going to be 76 feet that's the the road width for Ice Age Drive the concern was that the alignment would actually have to change in the future and so um we're giving them through this condition the certainty that the alignment is going to stay the same relative to their site plan because there's no easement on their property related to this corner there's other I'm sure there's other E's rights but as it relates to section that we're looking at there are no further right of way correct so once they give us the property they're they're done basically with the right-of-way dedication for Ice Age drive and any type of relocation of the gas line uh with Kinder Morgan that the city is going to accept the right-of-way with the easement with the Kinder Morgan line within that property and we will work with Kinder Morgan to relocate the line and they don't have to deal with that okay any other questions before we and just to clarify that'd be for All Phases of the Sherwood Common Commerce Center because this is phase one right so yeah the phase two really there shouldn't be any improvements that are uh that this Kinder Morgan line is encumbering so yes I mean it will I don't want to speak you know for a future application but based on but based on the you know we would take a look at it at that time and just make sure there's nothing else crazy going on this is you know the yeah I mean we could say with some certainty though it comes off the property here and their phase two is going to be all you know way down way down here there might be other things on phase two that come up during a time like that but not related to this yeah I just I was curious just because in condition of approval G6 uh we just say Sherwood commas Commerce Center and we don't we don't specify phase one I was curious on that so yeah um I think it's um it would be specific to this application okay so yeah all right okay yeah and somebody at city council or somebody's reviewed the title report preliminary title report legal description all that stuff quietly sitting at home but uh observing all of this has taken a closer look at it yeah perfect yes we've reviewed a title report and we worked with uh the applicant to uh draft to draft that statutory warranty deed that is attached to the materials great I wasn't planning on going out there with a measuring tape so yeah we'll do introductions first then I can go ahead and continue the applicant uh you have my address with Jordan Raymond's Law Firm Rob mcleanborg I'm here on behalf of Sherwood Commerce Center and I believe the address is also on there so thank so first of all again we want to thank Miss Richter and Mr Rutledge for all the time that they've spent with us fine-tuning these conditions and getting us to where I think we're in a very good place with the city just to address a couple of specific questions that were raised by Commissioners yes there there as Carrie had mentioned there is a draft copy of the statutory warranty deed that we worked with them to to draft to provide the certainty that the city wanted in terms of the language and making sure that they're getting what we're promising them will deliver there and I think Eric said it astutely it's really to provide us the the best certainty we can that we can open up our buildings in time and start you know utilizing them and then allow the city to have the maximum flexibility they need in discussing the Kinder Morgan easement because it it implicates property Beyond Where what we control um going down to the the condition G6 I think uh Vice chair waidola um I think it really it's only geared this is only a modification to the the prior approval so it's really only geared at uh Sherwood Commerce Center phase one and obviously as we we come forward with Commerce Center phase two that'll have its own process and um and as Eric had pointed out I don't believe that the Kinder Morgan easement has implicated in that that property but other other real property issues may arise when we come forward with that um other than that really just here to answer any specific questions you have in relation to our request and other than that we would request that you move forward with approval and go from there thank you all right my normal question is do you accept the conditions the staff laid out but it seems that um you are in agreements we have spent a lot of time uh with with Eric and Carrie on that on that so yes we're in agreement all right excellent does anybody have any questions at the thank you very much I appreciate your time and I appreciate working with staff I know some of these things get way above our heads because we're not in the legal realm we're in the review what legal tells us so it's much appreciated that you were able to work so closely with staff and come to a resolution that's agreeable to both parties that's very nice yeah again we appreciate it we think this is a win-win for both the city and our team so thank you yeah I would Echo that there was I know the conditions look like they're not a ton of text but a lot of thought and work went into it so Eric the rest of your staff and I think Carrie's on the phone really did a great job working with us great thank you very much um and we do not have any other members of the audience this evening did anybody uh sign up to testify um electronically this evening done okay so we have no proponents opponents or neutral testimony so rebuttal seems to be unnecessary unless you guys want to LEAP up and say anything else for the they are shaking their heads no the staff have anything they would like to add which specifically addresses a crush question raised during their testimony all right does any member of the commission have any questions regarding clarification of the testimony page eight has G6 through G10 is that we're because I think you only have two of these on the slide but I might have missed them all these conditions of

        "text": "ers and broadcasting according to the LDC requirements and as mentioned before, based on analysis, the PUD project is developed on a whitested commercial land use and join 312 units from the multifamily pool of Wested 3600 units. The rezoning from b two to this PUD reflects the county's practice to develop designed residential use on commercial site. All of those key factors are allowed and why state bad rights to write so? In conclusion, staff recommends approval with conditions. Planning and zoning committee recommends approval with conditions. Staff has shared the applicant with the conditions list and the applicant team agreed to follow all of the conditions we recommend to them. So commissioners, would you like me to go through the conditions or we can hand that to the applicant for their presentation. I'll bring it to the board for would you like to hear the conditions? I'm sure we would be helpful. Okay, yeah, we have read them, but let's go ahead and go through them for the sake of the audience. Okay good. So the PUD conditions that we proposed for this project is the PUD is restricted to a total maximum of 312 drillion unit, two storey, attached to motor family buildings and accompanying accessory amenities consistent with the Marine county land Development Code. The PUD application and PUD concept plan two the applicant shall provide detailed information and calculation regarding the number of residential drilling units from the VDRI vested rights assigned for the development. Three buffers shall be provided as shown on the submitted conceptual plan. Four. The final project operational traffic study shall be completed at the major site plan phase to the satisfaction of the county engineer and planning director. Adequate provision shall be made for the coordination of improvements with the PUD. Five, all access point locations will be worked out to the specification of the development review committee. During the time of development review. Six multimodal paths for pedestrian bags, golf carts and vehicles shall be provided as shown on the submitted conceptual plan seven. The PuD shall connect to bay laurel utilities. Eight. A major site plan submittal will need to be reviewed and approved through DRC for the proposed development of the site. Nine. Storm water review. During the development review phase will evaluate and determine whether the off site DRA unstabular property can meet the size and depth requirement to serve the development. To ensure LDC 6.13 is met with major set plan. Ten, provide a typical illustrations showing all setbacks. Eleven. Overhunts, such as building pop outs, cantilevers and or other extensions that project outward from the principal structure shall be revealed similar to the multiple family drilling. R. Three. Zoning classification of the LDC. Twelve. Multifamily buildings shall be maximum of 50ft in heighten, consistent with the conceptual plan. Any clubhouse building's height shall be a maximum of 40ft and accessory structures shall be limited to 20ft. The number 13 is not in the staff report. That's the condition that we proposed today and for discussion. So, number 13, the 70ft plus and 50ft plus green space separation along with the northwest boundary, shall be maintained as the no touch buffer wherein existing trees and hedge vegetation shall be maintained. However, the removal and replacement of dead or dying trees hedge vegetation may occur consistent with the land Development code. A hedge row a minimum of 8ft high shall be provided and maintained along the northwestern boundary that adjoins the utility lift station. Non vegetated gap on the buffer plants between the 70ft plus and 50ft plus green spaces and that's all for the conditions. Very good. Thank you, staff. Do you have any questions? Thank you, staff. Excuse me. I meant board for the staff. That's going to now give us an opportunity to hear from the applicant. So whoever is presenting on behalf of the applicant, if you'll please come forward. Name and address for the record. Good morning, commissioners. My name is Jessica Iserman. I'm an attorney with Stearns, Weaver Miller. My address is 401 East Jackson street. It's suite 2100 in Tampa, Florida. I'm here today representing the developer. I just have one quick housekeeping item. I have a binder of materials I would like to enter into the record. Those materials consist of the presentation. We are about to give you the three letters that we have sent the commissioners, with their attachments, as well as CV's of some of our experts, and updated transportation report which we will present to you today, as well as an email to the commissioners from Mister Kevin Shealy. Very good. And you have a binder for all of us? I have a binder for the clerk and the county attorney, if you would like. I'm sure that they will share with you if you need it. Other than the CV's, it's all materials you have seen. That's fine. Okay, thank you. Good morning. We're here today to present and we have our full applicant team available, including myself, Mister Boudier, our attorneys with Stearns Weaver and Mister Ken Metcalf is our AICP planner for civil Engineering. We have mister David Tillman and Jeff McPherson. With transportation. We have Kokwan, Ma with Kettleson and Associates. We have our developer with continental properties, Cameron Miller, and the owner on top of the world, representative Bo step. So, as you've heard in thorough detail from staff, we are here today representing, requesting a zoning change from vested b, two commercial to pud. This would ultimately, big picture allow 312 units, which would consist of two stories, and a density of 13.79 units per acre. We have various amenities which we'll go through today, but they include clubhouse, gym and pool, dog playground, and we do have significant open space. And when you can include the improved open space we actually have, 67% of the total area is open space. We're gonna walk through a few things today. First, we're gonna look at the location of the property in the context of the surrounding area. We'll also introduce you to continental properties and bring up their representative so he can answer any questions you may have. We'll review the LDC criteria, including the property's vesting and background. And we'll go through the Pud specifics in great detail, including the buffers, the setback, the height, etcetera. And then finally, we will have our experts conclude that the PUD is consistent with your comprehensive plan and complies with your land development code. So, as previously discussed, the property is located just off of Highway 200 and Southwest 99, 9th Street Road. This is an overview of the property with the concept plan laid into the surrounding area. So you can see from here. There we go, figuring out the signs. We have existing multifamily to the northe. These are the gates to the Oto retirement community. So the entrance of this property, the entrance to the multifamily is down here off of the unnamed spine road. And over on the other side of the hotel is an emergency only entrance or exit. So these are the various buildings. This is the existing sales center. Obviously you see the hotel, which is actually where I stayed last night. We have the Publix. This is an off site drainage retention area and various commercial parcels along State Road 200. And all the way up here is the Bridgewater park assisted living facility. But as you can see, I'm sure you're primarily concerned with the neighborhood to the north, which is the existing multifamily. And I just wanted to highlight how the concept plan fits into the existing area. On April 2 this year, this commission approved a replat of the area, which essentially consisted of a replat of these lots primarily, and splitting out the sales center from this lot eight, which is what we are concerned about today, is lot eight. This is the hotel, et cetera. So I'm going to bring up Cameron Miller. He has a master's in real estate, and he is director of development with Continental. Thank you, Miss Eiseman. Thank you, Miss Eiseman. Good morning, commissioners. For the record, my name is Cameron Miller with Continental Properties. I'm the director of development. Address is w 1349-8675 Executive Parkway, Menominee Falls, Wisconsin. 530-1551 Sorry. So going to go really quickly about the operational sides and then send it back to the experts to go over land use. Continental has been in business since 1979. We are a privately held, national multifamily developer. We develop, own, manage our branded apartment communities across 20 different states. We handle all day to day leasing, operations, maintenance, and overall management of the property. Dedicated on site team with 24 hours maintenance. Usually we have two leasing associates, an assistant community manager, and a community manager that typically stay on site 24/7 living there. Just a little bit more about our portfolio. Again, nationwide developer, 77 communities. Over 20,000 homes built in 14 states. This is our Florida presence. We've been very prominent in the Florida market for quite a few years. Since the nineties, we have 16 communities, almost 4500 homes looking for authentic Socala to be our 17th community. You guys already took a peek at the architectural elevation plans, but I do want to highlight, there was a question about the side and facades, about having windows. We do have windows on those facades. And we have some pictures here to show you guys, and we'll bring them up here momentarily. Here's just a quick, quick pick over our products and, you know, kind of what we provide. While these",

        "text": " through Sherwood by the time they pay their permit fees they are going to be paying them and going through the permit processing with the city so part of this agreement is going to be the administer well we'll administer the reimbursement District but you'll end up collecting the fees and then turning around and reimbursing us what you collect from the than then again just looking at the Sherwood obligations um again uh you've been partnering Jason uh your staff has been partnering with us throughout this project as we've been working on the last few years and project development uh review and approvals uh partnering in the public involvement you've been great coming to all the uh the public hearings that we've had a lot of questions that we get at those are really city-based questions we don't want to be answering on behalf of the city so really appreciate your involvement at that uh the financial shares we talked about and those will probably be avilable as we complete those those segements um and I just mentioned collecting the Cur CWS reimbursement as those fees come into the city but for part of the ERD and then ultimately um accepting ownership of this you know this is a uh line that is not we Define the regional lines as ones that are 24 Ines in diameter or larger none of this is actually 24 inch so as annexations take uh take place and these areas come into the city you will actually become owners of these lines and you would then take over the operation maintenance of these lines including the area further south that that's currently outside the Brookland service area yeah so that that area uh presumably we will we will continue to own till it comes into the city um Craigs worked for a long time with our operations folks uh we we end up working closely together on what really makes sense to maintain you know sometimes we get down to two District Lines among this two miles you know two segments sometimes there's some horse trading that uh that they do to make for efficiency of operations come and and you mean city limits or Urban growth boundary so as areas are annexed into the city limits the city will become the owners of yes if a there's there's an extension on that goes beyond the Brooklyn area what the city can grow into too so that's what would stay in the Clean Water Services ownership little Loop so that's really the updates that we wanted to give you today um happy to answer any questions about either the the financing the project anything else you would uh mayor on mute yeah no I'm reach trying to get the button going there um thank you for the update I I had a couple questions um and thank you for coming in today um in terms of the sizing of the the pipes can you talk a little bit about how you're doing that I'm assuming that you're sizing it based on you know what a future you know uh what brookman's going to look like in the future and assuming that Sherwood West gets completely um built out but are you looking even beyond that in terms of you know what's going to I mean are we I I'm just kind of asking this question in terms are we going to have to upgrade this pipe and 30 or 40 years or how do you look at that sizing yeah great great question um no we certainly look out to full potential buildout uh you know these sewers while we say a 50-year design life we certainly hope they last much longer than that so we really look at the tributary area you know there are some Oregon laws and how far we can look out we really can't plan for uh rural reserves we certainly plan for uh both Urban Reserve areas and undesignated areas um and actually we have a a map here which shows uh the the planning area for this sewer so you see some fairly large basins but then some areas beyond the uh Ur the urban growth boundary uh south of Brookman you can see there Basin five Basin 11 Basin 9 those are all areas that will be tributary to this line and we have uh sized it you know the line itself will not be extended to those areas now but in the future it will be and it's been sized for those good question mayor all right yeah thank you I I just a little curious about that and Basin 2 that's just basically following the topography because it because Sherwood West out in that area it actually extends a little farther than that that uh I guess would be the western side where that dotted line is so you're basically looking at where everything's gravity flow correct yes same thing with Basin one there's you know the the purple colored area there as you go further west it's still in the urban uh Reserve area in Sherwood West but actually drains towards chicken creek and I know you're not uh talking about this today but you know you're also looking at that forced main along Rogers yes and I I'm assuming you're sizing it the same way way looking at the basins over on that side that's correct yes so the uh Pump Station that will eventually be built out there and those Force Mains are sized to handle the uh again the urban Reserve area um the the whole planning area what would be tributary to that pump station okay thank you you're welcome anyone have any questions excited that we're at this point in the project appreciate the update and uh fingers crossed on opening yes when when's the bid do by 29th had a question on your timeline it looked like years 25 to 29 the restoration maintenance and monitoring what what does that entail we get more detail on that uh sure so when we when we build the sewer line that's going down through a lot of sensitive areas near the streams that and through Wetlands we have to restore those areas and we have Perman requirements to monitor the plantings make sure that they're established and and growing well so we'll take several years of monitoring those coming out several times a year taking pictures removing invasive species planting more plants if we need to and um submitting that information back to the state that we're in compliance per basically putting it back to this shape it was in prior to digging in or better or better and that's even if we take over part of that like if we take over a portion of the line because on Brookman you're still doing the Restorations yeah we'll have to finish the permit conditions okay that's another reason they ran the project they have a lot of wetland buffer Wetland scientists and on staff and so it's more of an environmental restoration maintenance requirement for permit so we're thankful for that sounds like yes oh yeah yeah we're um we're hiring a contractor to build the sewer line but a lot of that restoration work will be done by CWS forces that do that all over the district so they do that in housee all right well thank you so much thanks guys you're welcome next on the agenda is The Shard West update we'll swap scats again we didn't plan that well you don't need us back to back we got take a break yeah get these doing all steps for me thank you thank you there you go all right um no wor thank you so yeah here to talk about Sherwood West joined by Bruce um Joy's behind me as well joy was involved in this uh refinement project um so here to talk about refinement study that we did to the Sher West concept plan if you recall you accepted the concept plan in July um we were able to just push if you will the the planning a little bit further especially for the North District and the goal was to try and get it as development ready as possible and so we brought on a consultant McKenzie for that um we also were able to squeeze in some of the feedback we got during the work sessions councelor may had some really good input on cost questions on cost estimates and so we're able to update those numbers as well and really get more refinement more accuracy through this study um so just really quickly schedule February 20th we're at today um next week on the 27th we'll go to the washingt Washington County Board of commissioner staff will um and just give an update on T West at a work session kind of show the final plan bring in this refinement study as well take any questions and just like we do that's going to prepare us to go uh forward with a resolution uh of support with the Washington County Board of Commissioners in April um March 5th um be our next uh city council meeting we will bring forward a resolution to um reaccept this concept plan with the with the refinement study we'll also be bringing forward the IGA that's required with the county as part of the application um basically what that is is a transportation IG basically says we will cooperate with each other on funding and access and all that sort of stuff um and then we will also be looking for your blessing to actually submit the application to Metro in in the concept plan final form that when you say that that's the request to expand Urban growth boundary application Y and so that um the April 5th is our at full application to Metro to expand the urban growth boundary and we're going to request that you guys give staff that blessing on March 5th March 5th March 5th and then we're going to apply on April 5th can after we apply can we resend or amend our application based on what Metro has said yes based on what they have said that was I we yeah I think yes okay um I don't know if I'll be ready by March 5th because of this house bill you know I don't want to rail this work session but that bill would well we're going to talk about that okay I'll shut and I think I'll I'll Circle back with Metro just you know between now and March 5th I'll Circle back with them and and you know let them know kind of um if that's if that seems appropriate I just really make sure what that looks like but we we've asked them this before I think you've raised question yeah I think I think the way I would the way I would want to know is whenever whenever the whenever the final point of no return I want to know what that is so that I can either definitively act or not act ahead of that time or we can definitively act or not act ahead of that time based on the what we know and I think don't know I think it's a",
