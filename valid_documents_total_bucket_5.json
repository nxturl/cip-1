        "text": " want this contested case process to be any more expensive or onerous than it has to be it should be efficient it should be quick we should be having fights about did the applicant meet the standard or did they not we should not be having fights about I'm a party you know did I argue with this those are going to happen but we should make sure the rules are as clear as they can be to minimize the amount of time that we spend in that process on those kind of process issues so that's kind of my Approach is the rules uh coordinator on this project is you know where can we identify issues of confusion where we create or modify the existing rules in a way that will make them easier to understand for uh this the um the applicant but but also for those who are want to participate in the process so that they can preserve their rights so they know you know for example it has come up and it's going to continue to come up you know what what kind of sufficient specificity and we should maybe come up with the you know a shortened version of that because it's really hard to say um three times fast especially uh you know what does that mean so and and knowing that they can prepare ahead of time and then participate and have a discussion on the merits about you know did the did the applicant meet the standards or not uh not have debates on did I raise this issue did I not raise this issue again those will inevitably come up uh regardless of what we do but we should make sure the rules are not contributing to the confusion uh in that process so some great comments uh from Renewables Northwest okay let's move to uh Davis Wright Tremaine yeah Tom so uh this is Derek um I'm gonna pass over to to Elaine who's joined us here I might I'll just say real quickly that I think that your uh the scope um of the objective makes sense here look forward to kind of hearing more of the details from there um I want to pass over to let her have a chance to introduce herself as well you're muted Elaine sorry about that uh good morning uh Elaine Albridge with Davis Street Tremaine I'm a permitting partner here in our Portland office and I've been working with renewable energy developers um navigate both local and state level citing processes um happy and looking forward to um I'll Echo a lot of the comments that Max raised from renewable Northwest about you know the hopes for this rack I do think probably all parties involved with like a simpler clearer process um that's efficient and so that's I think you know some common ground probably we all have for contested case proceedings and just another kind of you practical thing to put out there is that how do the evidentiary you know requirements in a contested case relate back to the DPO proceeding and how could we meet the DPO process more robust and have um issues raised by stakeholders earlier in the process that would allow an applicant the opportunity to more fully address them on the DPO record um to hopefully minimize the amount of issues that might go to contesta case so I'm just thinking about ways we could um you know work work towards having less issues come up in a contested case and really have you know only the real substantive ones be be the subject of contested cases so we're not dealing with a contested case on every single thanks and look forward to participating all right thank you Elaine uh Northwest Natural uh I don't I don't really have a whole lot at this point um I'm going to look listen and learn as this process moves forward the one thing that I am interested and and probably is already in some of the presentations we'll be providing is uh who's responsible for the costs of a contested case and how are those divvied up between the parties other than that I don't have anything at this point all right um pacificor um I'm kind of in the listen and learn at this point as well so I no comments for the group at this moment okay no worries all right well that is that is the rack I think um we kind of have a good sense of how things are going it uh it kind of sounds like to me we have uh and uh Irene and Jim who represent the public who have been involved in you know in the contested case process and who have kind of identified and staff has as well kind of a lot of these issues where it is confusing to um participants who are who are opposing projects to to understand how to navigate these sort of you know it is essentially a you know a legal matter uh in terms of How It's framed and how it's approached I mean these people are not necessarily attorneys themselves and so uh we have kind of these like legal Concepts like what is sufficient specificity uh where you know we can add some clarification some details what does it mean to be a party uh how do you you what does it mean to be a limited party uh these sorts of things that hopefully we can clarify in a way that we minimize the arguments in the contested case um to just the kind of the substantive matters again like did this where the standards met where the standards not um so uh all right well I'm going to turn it over to the kind of public comment portion we have actually quite a bit of time for public comment uh if anybody who is not a member of the rack um or if you are a member of the rack at this point uh if no if there are no members of the public who wish to to speak up if you are in the if you are joined the team sessions uh feel free to use the raise hand function I don't see anybody who's just on the who called in so you know use the little hand guy uh yes we have uh Dugan hopefully you pronounced that right yeah so Dugan uh with uh pinegate uh Pine gate Renewables or renewable energy out of uh North Carolina but that have developed several projects in Oregon and um has an application in front of the commission right now I just want to voice our support uh for uh the words of um Max uh renewable Northwest and uh you know agree with staff here about wanting to find efficiencies and just ensuring that you know this process is can be you know made as quick and do a good decision as possible whatever that ends up being um you know I think we similarly feel that you know we take a look at fsec as compared to the other states we develop in and um it certainly is is more robust which is great in some ways but that often leads to also administratively robust uh which sometimes can um you know cause problems and you know we're committed to building the projects that Oregon wants uh clearly by policy but we also want to make sure that those are going to you know get through the process on time and um you know not be unduly delayed so I'm excited to see this process move forward and um you'll probably I don't know if we will directly comment but we'll work with our our groups either the Oregon uh solar and storage Industries Association or other places you'll probably see some comments from us on this uh we'll not make in the future so I just wanted to say hello and thank you awesome great perfect uh uh introduction there and um you know this is the that was the perfect time to do so uh yeah no we um I should have said this at the beginning but we definitely encourage each of you um throughout this process to reach out to uh you know other similarly interested parties um in in kind of your space to kind of solicit additional feedback uh to bring to the rack so you don't have to just you know this is not just you representing your you know particular uh constituent if you you know if you if you are kind of rub the elbows with others who are in a similar field and you kind of share your thoughts and what's kind of going on and they have additional thoughts or whatever bring you can bring that feedback to the rack um we're more than interested to hear um but then again they those those p uh interested parties will have opportunities to directly uh reach out to the uh to the process um again particularly during the public comment period um are there any other um public participants who are interested in making additional comments okay not seeing anybody I'm gonna move so that brings us to next steps so we're gonna we're zoomed right through this all right so sounds like uh uh I can sort of predict how this is going to go but if you have after after kind of listening to what was said today I took notes there's actually part of um uh if you if you want I can send it to you maybe I'll just upload it along with the video but teams does put out a transcript it's not perfect it's going to make mistakes but it is a pretty accurate fairly accurate um transcript of what was said uh today um I could send that to you but uh so I do have kind of a record of what of what was said but if you felt like uh some clarity would be helpful I guess I'm talking mainly to Irene and Jim Who provided the most substantive comments uh it would be helpful for me because I'm going to take those suggestions and send them out to the group I want to make sure that I'm accurately characterizing what it is that you want uh please submit uh some written comments to me by uh end of day tomorrow uh just so that um yeah again I can I can kind of give the rack the best representation of whatever whatever it is that you're you're interested in um the goal will then be that I will quick as quickly as I can uh kind of turn that around into a packet for the rack to review uh I'm gonna with along with that packet I'm going to send a uh essentially a Word document of the rules just kind of a clean uh document that you can you can put your thoughts you know directly into that document and track changes or in comment bubbles or whatever you want to do uh to then share with the rack um about your thoughts and feelings about what was said today and what the other rack members have said or if you have not or developed specific ideas like I want this role to be changed to say X or whatever it might be um it's part of that packet I'm going to send out a vote so we will you know with just like we did for this one uh it'll have a bunch of times uh I don't want to push this too far",

        "text": " filled for in relation to this project or filed sorry filed for in relation to this project or another source of ITC and can you please define what ITC acronym stand for for the crowd the my well to be bluntly honest like all I've ever called it is ITC so my brain is locked into just that so I can't uh specifically Define that but um but that essentially it's the investment investment tax credit I believe for the Renewable Energy Systems um and uh and bex's questions the first part of the question uh beex is that we're we ask we're asking that on the application uh just so that we have an idea if there's going to be an intention to go for the ITC credit or not or if that's not sure uh that has no bearing on the eligibility or impact or even the funding uh for C uh it's just mostly another data collection point that we have uh so that uh if something arises later on down the line we're prepared uh to be able to assist um and one of the reasons that this has come up with a lot of projects is C uh eligible applicants uh are almost almost all non- taxable entities and within the inflation reduction act uh it was allowed for the IRS to allow for uh renewable energy credits uh in the uh tax credits under the ITC for non- taxable entities uh prior to that they'd only been available to taxable entities so this is really just kind of a datao question but this does not have any bearing on the application or funding in any way shape or form we do not consider the ITC as an incentive that needs to be added uh into your application I hope that last part uh helped out thank you um Ali detrio I apologize again if I'm butchering your last name from reimagine Power says can a single applicant apply for both planning grants at the same time or do they have to choose one over the other for example can an applicant submit a renewable planning Grant and a separate resilience planning grant for two different efforts yeah it's absolutely possible uh to do so uh we've had organizations that have submitted multiple applications during one round in the past so please do I would would like to add that uh Geographic diversity is a is a program consideration um so that's just something to take into your Calculus when you're deciding to submit multiple great um a few more coming in here um again for Mike and Monica Ang could an applicant application contact provide login credentials email address and password to the authorized representative for their final review signature and submittal uh that uh just to jump that that would um how how you handle that locally is would be how you got how you choose to handle that locally we would not be able to advise on that great um that one was EAS uh the next one is uh an important question from Timothy how does the reimbursement work for partner projects oh yes so oh go ahead D sorry I missed go ahead I was I was just gonna ask you to reread that Sarah I absolutely from Timothy uh he asks how does the reimbursement work with partner projects yeah so from a from a reimbursement perspective the applicant the the funds are are distri uted to the applicant and U if you uh are going to pass that uh those funds on to a partner you need to establish an agreement with that partner and handle that uh in in way that corresponds to that agreement yeah I think it's it's one thing just to to clarify the language is that Odo uh Odo views the applicant if awarded would become the grantee uh Odo EX exclusively views that organization as the grantee we do not look at Partners as sub grantees and uh and how we handle those costs um there has been some changes with the most recent legislative session to streamline and make the the accounting of partner costs versus grantee costs or incurred uh paid or incurred a little bit easier but that's more to streamline uh our dispersement process but Partners would re receive their dispersed funds through the grantee not from Odo great um the next question from Janice Hardy says for the planning Grant are expenses incurred before the application close date eligible for reimbursements or one just after that date just uh just after the application close date the application close date or the application is granted and an an agreement is together the app the you will not know if you're awarded for much further down into the future but if you have a project that is that is going to be starting that you know is going to be starting uh eligible costs if awarded a cup Grant you can submit uh eligible cost dating back to the closed date of the application period in this case May 10th of this year okay thank you so much um Michael asks how does pass through funding from the lead applicant to a c partner work can a partner own any of the renewable systems or com components funded via C the the partner can completely own those Concepts so I think maybe a a best way to think about the partner when it's the best way to think about a a a partner applicant experience is that in a pass through scenario is that uh you're working with that organization to submit the C Grant based on those eligibilities we see the grantee uh as the as who is holding that contract and we're providing those funds uh back to the grantee so it almost becomes as if your applicant then becomes your grantee or becomes your fund to pass through those back on to the partner um but the simple the simple part of this is is that we have private we have private uh projects within C right now that are running through those pass through scenarios and I if I didn't say that clear I welcome uh anyone here to yeah I think the only thing that I would add is with that there's obviously a clear need to display a community benefit um so for um you know there has to show how this uh project is going to um benefit the community particularly environmental justice communities in the um okay one more question that I'm seeing in the chat um feel free again final uh final call for your questions um April says I was looking through the application in the online portal yesterday and I didn't see anything that noted character count limits for any of the questions do you know where we find the Chara character count limits for question yeah that was something I covered here just a few minutes ago that I had uh I intended to cover toward the beginning of the of the program and that is that we do hold the C application to be a relatively clear concise application uh the majority of the text response boxes are going to be at a 2,000 character limit uh we have identified another handful of characters throughout or handful of responses throughout the application uh where those will be up to 5,000 characters uh those have been identified as areas that would probably likely have maybe a little bit more information so yes we are looking for economy um and conciseness in the application but as I mentioned earlier if you if there's a particular item or question or or a couple of that come up that uh that that that definitely need to have more uh as part of what you want to respond with uh you can supplement that answer with an upload but as I also said we do expect to see uh we do except to expect to see a substantial portion of that answer in the text respon response area on the application itself I'll build on that just a little bit most of the items the responses that have uh 5,000 characters have a significantly larger uh space allotted to them and I'll also take a takeaway of looking at adding um those counts uh to the app user guide if possible great and this is a fantastic question to end on thank you Lydia from Northwest housing alternative she says what is the estimated timeline for making Awards this round uh what we are doing in this particular round um you may have noticed on the program homepage uh we have we have the timeline of the entire round uh on the the homepage of the program uh in Prior rounds we had gone through our eligibility our competitive review we then did all the calculations to create the list for the director's selection uh and that all happened in a real relatively uh uh consistent and timely Order each after the other uh in this round we one of the items that we are going to be doing a little different this round is that we are going to be holding that notification a little bit longer so that we can actually uh develop uh get contracts and Exhibits and those things ready to go ahead of schedule um for the announced award e and then that way once this happens we're ready to begin moving those project s forward uh a little bit more quickly than we have in the past um and I'm going to add a piece to this that's not necessarily related but I wanted to make sure we mention that we have also updated a lot of the resources and guides for the for current grantees uh C uh that also is an excellent area for applicants to look through because that's going to give you some really good snapshots of specifically what uh your expectations and requirements will be if awarded uh it also will give you uh really good breakout information for preparing an application for things such as the eligible costs uh for a planning or for a construction Grant and a lot of other really good resources uh to pay attention to great um thank you everyone for submitting all those questions um if you go to the next slide I'm going to jump in with just one comment it came up in a couple of our questions that had to do with uh grantees Partners uh accountability I I think the best way to say this uh the clearest is that uh between the C program if awarded the uh the applicant or now the grantee uh is viewed by Odo as being the accountable party for the grant uh as well as for for the project success and so when there's a partner relationship involved that's why it becomes so important for the applicant and the partner to also have a clear local agreement between themselves uh to ensure the success of that project so I hope that small clarification uh helps perfect thank you so much um there's one more question and it's actually kind of a good question so can we get a copy of the budget spreadsheet without accessing the portal yes there's a link to that to be able to it's going to be a popup download and that is",

Pledge of I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all okay we have uh public comment Mark is here Mark wig if you want to come up to the side over here mark yep right there make sure you pull that microphone up close enough that we can hear your voice thank you I'm Mark wig I live in Marion County and a couple of things I wanted to comment on one was uh that was an excellent state of the county meeting thank you very much it was very positive a lot of good people there the second thing you wanted to comment on was uh number seven your expansion of the mental health Counseling in the county I wanted to thank you for pursuing that and pushing that forward most of you who have probably heard of Melissa Blake the 34 year old woman who died on the streets of Salem and I mental health counseling may have helped that person the um Senator Patterson right now has a bill that she's pushing through that says we need better coordinations before we release somebody from hospitals we need better coordination and it's sb1076 and what I would like to see from you folks is that you ask her to expand that to include the state hospital and the prisons that you don't just release people out onto the street and um so just a you know a heads up on that one and then the one other thing I wanted to ask is um uh Melissa died but since October these other people have died that were unsheltered in Marion County Larry sticks Cynthia Janet Scotty Brittany James Judith Christine Eric Mike Scott and Lou that since October last year 40 people died that were and most of them need help and so thank you but could you please have your medical officer publish the names of the people that are unsheltered that have died because with right now we just have a number you don't get names I don't get last names you can't find last names you can't find names ages of the people that are dying on our streets you need a medical officer to get that information and I think it would help push our programs forward to know who is dying anyway thank you very much Mark thank you're not wrong but I just want to be very transparent on the record that this board does everything in its power to convince the Oregon legislative body of the needs in our community and it's actually going to take citizens like yourself to be as persistent if not more than us to be heard so I'm working with her perfect well I really appreciate that you are working with her because she needs to hear from the people who elected her uh to do this job and I'm not I don't know much about how things are reported in the medical system but uh that's run through the District Attorney's office and I'll follow up with Paige to see what that looks like um it may be out of our control that I'm happy to explore it further thank you thanks for being here thank you Mark um I'm going to pass the gavel back to the chair welcome uh I I would like to make uh Mark I appreciate your your um and I appreciate that you're going to follow up with the district attorney what we can and can't um and in regards to Senator Patterson I was just in the building testifying on a wildfire Bill and happened to run into the senator and we had a very good heated discussion about Senate Bill 488 and then I asked her why she filed Senate Bill 1081 without even talking to us and um we just agreed to disagree and um uh she said she heard that I made some comments about her uh at our state of the county and I will stand by those count those comments and I made it the state of the County uh when I said you know when you when you said that 30 out of 100 people died of cancer when you're introducing a bill about a waste of energy facility you impugned motives that that these people are dying because of our Environmental Services policies in Marion County and that was wrong and I will not apologize for what I said and I said we'll just agree to disagree and I went on and testified for a very important bill for our Wildfire victims in the Next Room I'm glad I got to make that public comment this morning thank you there you go and oh well and you were sharing this this meeting that's pretty good Superman see you mark okay so next up on the agenda is our health and human services Proclamation is that right yeah Carissa come on up we're going to consider approval of a proclamation designating the month of March as intellectual and developmental disabilities Awareness Month in Marion is always one of my favorite proclamations every year my tech skills are on track today it feels like a Monday to me but it's thank goodness it does uh good morning um for the record I'm Carissa neufeldt I'm the Human Services Division director for Marion County Health and Human Services and I have the great pleasure of supporting our County intellectual and developmental disability program this morning I come before you to share with you about um intellectual and developmental disabilities and to request that you adopt a proclamation proclaiming march to be intellectual and developmental disability month with me today I have brought three guests who will speak during our presentation but I would just like to just introduce them first I we have Elizabeth Vasquez from the Elsinore theater we have Ashley herb from Shangri-La and we have Kevin zwart from the Kroc Center with us today so um as you know from past years March is intellectual and developmental disability month it was first proclaimed or declared by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 he declared March as developmental disability awareness month this month is an opportunity for us to educate our community to broaden awareness about intellectual and developmental disabilities to and to help our community understand how each and every one of us can help support the citizens in our community who experience an intellectual or developmental disability thrive so a little information about Oregon and specific to Marion County so Oregon was the first state in our country to close its institutions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities which was Fairview here in our backyard and we now have a Fairview is no longer there there's a nice Housing Development that's been been popping up around there around the property but Oregon is very proud of the fact that it was it led the way in closing institutions and many states not all but Most states have followed in in our leadership there I'm here in Marion County we have over 3 200 children and adults who identify as having an intellectual or developmental disability and they're served by three case management entities so Marion County integrated Services Network and resource connections of Oregon here in Marion County we also have a number of providers here that support individuals who don't want to necessarily live at home or can't live at home or can't live independently and so we have 350 residential licensed 24-hour residential providers we have that includes 24-hour residential providers adult foster homes and children foster homes we also have approximately 1600 personal support workers who support individuals living at home with their families or living independently in the community so this year's theme is putting the unity in community and that theme really comes from the fact that we've lived through the last three years of covid and many people have experienced a sense of isolation but really it is our community who helps us Thrive and we really want to be coming back together and having more coordinated efforts to be able to support individuals and those who experience in intellectual and developmental and as I said at the beginning we are hoping that everyone understands that they can do something to support So a call to action as we think about putting the unity in community is taking actions to provide accessible and affordable our individuals who experience intellectual and developmental disabilities frequently have a challenging time extra barriers to find Dean housing hiring individuals who experience intellectual and developmental disabilities unemployment amongst people with disabilities is the highest among all classes of individuals promoting and developing inclusive and social recreational activities taking steps to ensure your business or organization provides inclusive and accessible services volunteering or working for an organization who supports people with intellectual or developmental disabilities and extending a supportive hand to a neighbor just having can go a long ways in supporting someone or their family who experiences an intellectual or developmental disability so this morning as I said I've brought three guests with me and these guests are invited because their businesses are doing things that are helping to put unity in community and I wanted to be able to acknowledge them and to allow them to share a little bit about what they're doing so first up is Elizabeth from the Elsinore theater hello hello my name is Elizabeth Vazquez via I am the operations manager at the Elsinore theater I'm here to tell you a little about our project monthly movie fun at the Elsinore this event series was created by our development director Sally Litchfield um our monthly movies find series is a series of 12 free movies for adults experiencing disabilities they are Century friendly with reduced volume and open captioning this project was made possible by two grants we received the first was a 7 500 Grant by the City of Salem cultural and tourism promotion and Advisory Board and a five thousand dollar Grant from the Gibney Family Foundation thanks to these grants we are able to offer these movies free of charge to clients of Marion County DD service Polk County DD service resource connections of Oregon and the integrated Services Network as well as free admission for a companion and a free popcorn and a beverage as well so soda or juice and any friends and family that would like to join can do so for five dollars our movies are every third Tuesday of the month at 1 pm our why behind this project is to remove Financial barriers to entertainment to provide opportunity for fun and social engagement in the community and to share the castle-like interior of the 96 year old theater and we've been able to do just that we were we are able to offer a space of social gathering for adults experiencing disabilities many of whom have come to all the movies and they really enjoy seeing one another getting to just have a space where they can just say hello to one another and",

flat even the face of significant inflation next slide please I just wanted to get a little more detail about customers and communities and that's by 2030 PGE aspires to be able to meet as much as 25 of our energy needed on the hottest and coldest days with power coming from customers and distributed energy resources our entire decarbonization strategy takes a Community First lens to make sure that the Clean Energy Future is accessible to all so we are going to need to work with customers with local governments with um contractors with suppliers and community members along this way and this really these are two Energy Efficiency is a significant piece of our plan as well as a community-based renewable energy resources cbres and I just wanted to just highlight the the importance of these items as well as working with all of you and our customers next slide please now what does that mean for uh Salem all of all of that but I really wanted to um mayor Hoy and counselors the incredible working relationship we have with City staff who are continually working with us on how to support find efficiencies as well as support your climate action goals and that would be um Heather and Ryan and certainly before Heather's time uh your re you're retired I can't recall her name right now but she was wonderful to work with I'm sorry I apologize to her she was great to work with as well but one of the things that's exciting is that you are now getting energy uh you are a member of the green future impact uh and you uh approve that agreement two years ago I believe um and you were one of ten local governments now that is getting energy from I'm gonna say try to honor this from the patch why it feels um in eastern Oregon so this is Oregon's largest solar facility and it's now generating power thanks to your part in participation in the green future IMPACT it's it's uh powering your city what was I going to say about that so I want to say a little bit because I love I love this so much uh patch wywit means sun in the sahabin language so that the project is located on seated lands of the confederated tribes of orange rings and the name paints homage to the rich history and stewardship of born Springs and Umatilla tribes and just so you know how large this project is it spans about nearly 1200 acres and includes about 471 000 solar panels uh and so we're really excited that that Pro that um facility is online and that you're receiving your energy from it I also wanted to give an update we came we were here last year talking about the community supported Renewables effort and uh a short term we call it the muni tariff and I wanted to just give you a little bit of background on that so again it's an opportunity for local governments together with their households and small businesses to drive acceleration of for renewable resources and Emissions reduced at a at pays faster than PGE in the state of Oregon so it's a community-wide um since recently we filed our clean energy plan um and it provides insights into how we intend to comply with House Bill 2021 um which require an addition of three thousand three to four thousand megawatts of non-immediate resources by 2030 we have valued the input and engagement and feedback from the city's staff here and that includes Heather and on the on on the development of this so one of the things that we're going to do is pge's procurement cycle so we'll put out a 2023 RFP and it's scheduled to identify viable projects uh in the spring of 2024 and at that point PGE would be better positioned or best position to share share indicative pricing for a potential Muni tariff offering uh noting the inability to kind of provide pricing today given the procurement environment challenges namely macroeconomic pressure supply chain inflation sonar tariffs so uh again we're gonna we're gonna wait until 2024 just to have a better sense of where we're at with that community supported um uh and so there's another way that I wanted to highlight so as we work together some things that could be coming up uh that I will work with your staff on is potentially citing generation storage um and electric vehicle charging in the um and you may have heard that we just announced the second largest battery uh facility uh in the metro area in the country it's the second largest in the um and we will be looking for more of that and that could be something that we'd be coming to you the other area is uh federal funds as we look to see opportunities to maximize cost efficiencies we may be looking to partner with you um on potential federal funds and like I said we have applied for over 500 million uh and we could we're going to be looking for more so that we can utilize those funds in support of this clean energy transition with that next slide now I'm happy to talk to answer any well thank you Wendy for that presentation I have a quick question on storage we've we met with um a commercial storage provider recently who's looks like planning on something on Fairview industrial are you is that something that you're involved in is that I wasn't clear what pgas pge's role was with that project do you know about that I do know about that and we have received questions about uh are we talking to them and we have we are talking to them from an uh energy perspective so serving them um but I can find out more because again I just got an update over the weekend about them and so let me let me get um an update and I'm happy to send that along to you mayor and share what kind of Engagement we're involved but yes we are aware of that facility thank you yeah it looked pretty exciting but I wasn't really clear about the business model it seems like it's going to be a commercial Venture where they buy electricity from your store then sell it back or something is that kind of the idea I I don't know I just know it's a larger scale uh commercial battery storage so I but again I will get the details because I'm not sure myself thank you other questions well I'm really interested in the Thousand page document but do you have like a like a 10 page documentation yeah an executive summary I would love to see something like that that's better than one slide but not ten thousand or whatever it is oh is that is that uh council president Stapleton it is yeah okay I can't I'm sorry I can't see you yes I'm more than happy counselor Stapleton to send you the executive summary and that is a much more digestible uh document so I I can send that to um Heather and Ryan um and they can pass it along to you thank you I'm really interested in trying to find ways to cite solar locations within the city that can kind of help get us more sustainable and electricity here and and what that looks like and and how it would work but how can we help you get that done and what does it look like in our community to see that so foreign we did a tour of the new Public Works building on Friday and got got a little bit more information on the new micro grid that's going in there and with the solar panel and people feed it and it's really exciting yeah I want to know like that but times bigger right yeah I want to know how that looks across the whole city yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and I just want to say again working with Heather uh and others we uh that micro bid was a huge win it's the first one in the state that Odo awarded and the first micro Community micro Goods so we're really excited about that project and uh thankful to work with your staff um the other one that I want to know and I don't have the numbers in front of me but I certainly can um get the most out Brian might actually have them but um because you were a member of uh you signed for the green future impact and you were a part of green uh future um in terms of silly City facilities energy uh you are tremendously ahead um on getting your again City facilities from renewable resources and I am happy to provide those numbers but Ryan may actually have them as well it was I don't put you on spot Ryan but you might have those numbers as well we're right around 85 percent 85 of the electricity for our facilities are the electricity that we buy from PGE is renewable there's also we buy from civil electric and the facilities are in their service territory okay but of what we purchased from say from PGE is around does that so if you were to factor in the code generation facility at will a lake does that number even go up higher than but because that's I'm assuming we're not purchasing that electricity I'm not sure how that factors okay because that's electricity we're generating right so this would be electricity that we are purchasing right kg so um in terms of total usage that would be an interesting thing to look at so because that's a huge amount that's powering out basically that whole facility right right Michael yeah I do um so Wendy thank you this is Mike Slater I'm a salon planning commissioner um I'm very interested to just pick up on counselor Stapleton on how we expand um the footprint of renewable energy in Salem and storage facilities and particularly interested from a resiliency standpoint as well have you worked with a city that has developed like their own energy plan um like a renewable energy plan or resiliency plan like a city-wide to get it what cancer Stapleton was talking about like a a long-term City",

        "text": " think undeveloped and is mostly habitat area the portion of the site that's to the west of little Butter Creek is more of a mosaic of crop land and Disturbed areas um and has uh slightly more prevalence of access roads and um for public roads and um developed areas with within it um you could go to the next slide please um we got the uh results of the certificate holders Botanical surveys including noxious weed surveys as part of rfa1 um there was mapping associated with that that also showed the locations of Lawrence milkvetch populations um so that wasn't included in the public record uh of the DPO but we did ask the certificate holder to give us a non-controversial or non uh confidential version of that um uh so that was included in the comment packet um for you all just just uh as illustration really um uh most noxious weeds well noxious weeds are considered noxious um at typically if they're classified as Class A or Class B weeds by the state or by a county um for the purposes uh of us today um Class A weaves are uh subject to eradication or intensive control they're basically considered to be um more of an immediate danger or I think um more able to be controlled than not as widespread Class B weeds are subject to control on a site specific basis um the exact definitions and um requirements do vary by jurisdiction but um those categories are generally consistent um we just wanted to point out that there were num numerous weeds listed as class a species at the county level found at the site um uh those included um more than 100 observations of common Spike weed and Scotch Thistle and more than 20 observations of yellow star Thistle and Rush skeleton weed um those are wased as Class A either in Morrow or umill County depending on what county you're on um but I think there is concerned that um weeds in one County that are was set as a in the other don't don't spread uh from one County to the other um this is really just to show what we're looking at most of these weeds are distributed throughout different areas of the site um but as you would imagine a lot of them are concentrated along existing uh access roads or waterways or other Disturbed um uh if you can go to the next um well yeah so I guess uh there were some specific comments raised about koshia coacha um this weed is uh Twisted as a Class B weeds in both counties um but it is fairly widespread um and I just want to give a little more background information I didn't know much about this before the public comment period so I thought it was helpful to pull the uh um Department of agricultures kind of back sheet that's where this information's from so it's a a fast growing annual uh that grows up the six feet tall um uh it does uh really grow anywhere but um it's particularly found on pasture range lines roadsides uh ditches uh and cultivated areas that aren't controlled um I know in general and in moral County specifically we've heard from the weed supervisor that it does become we herbicide resistant fairly quickly and there are herbicide resistant populations in the county already um and then it does spread really fast uh it does produce about according to the Department of agriculture's uh uh information produce about 14,000 600 seeds per plant uh and then as the season ends the plant can turn into a tumble weed so I think it does spread more quickly in part because of those two factors um people on the record did also raise concern that because it's such a large Plant and it does tumble and it does have such a large skeleton that it does increase fire risk um and I think there is at least some butor and information to support that conclusion that it it is not uh it does can contribute to fire hazard if it does get out of control um so kind of that was that's some of the background information and if I can get the next slide um so to address the the two sides of this which I think are is the plan good enough and will it be implemented correctly and then Are there specific things that need to happen for kosia um we do we did get a comment from the county um requesting that the council require by condition funding for a full-time um employee of the County uh to go out and do weed inspections provide technical assistance um and uh coordinate with us to make sure that the weed plan is being implemented correctly uh we took a look at this we don't think that that uh particular recommendation is actionable by us um but we do agree that additional oversight of noxious weeds um is is Justified um at the site I know there's been some issues at the other wheat rdge facilities um there's just it's a it's also just a very big site um and there's a lot of ground to cover um so we don't have a specific recommendation as far as an additional condition to be put in the the DPO but we do um recommend or we we do agree that we can include language uh just clarifying that we can include additional um funds in our compliance assessment to make sure that there is adequate Personnel to um ensure compliance with um the fish and wildlife habitat standard essentially to to ensure that noxer seds are not um unad at the site um and uh provide additional inspections oversight and I think there's ongoing conversations with the county and with the county um we Department um about what a more sustainable long-term solutions for um Just Energy development in that area more yeah councelor Byer um thank you for the pictures of the kosher cuz I had no clue 6 ft tall is a little frightening but I think in this case as with some of our other projects um there's so much Disturbed ground right even on a temporary basis but getting on top of the noxious weeds early is pretty critical so whatever conditions we can include that reinforce how important it is to monitor for those and then control because we're disturbing a lot of ground and once you get the weads in they do impact the agricultural economy so so thank you for taking this on councelor gril hi for the record this is Marcy gril and um I understand what we can take action on and not but I would hope that the certificate holder is paying attention I think it is a real concern um I am dreading going home because I'm supposed to be spraying at my own house uh today and I can imagine trying to tackle something like this uh on a project so uh I think my ask is this that the certificate holder really think about how they can support um the county um it is a warl county there's a lot of I spent a lot of time over there and I can't now like I'm I don't know I feel like I'm driving around I'm looking at things I wasn't looking at before because of like Jordan said earlier from our the education that we get here I'm a pretty tall girl and seeing something on the side of row that's 6 feet tall could be a little daunting so um secretary esterson thank you chair how um this is more broad so I apologize for adding it to the wheat regie presentation but um we are about a month away from having an individual in place that we've selected in coordination Morrow County planning and we Department who will operate as a dual enforcement compliance officer specific to noxious weeds in Morrow County um and I think that is a two-year plan um and then from there we'll have to figure it out but we're kind of test running how this might work but it's much more robust of an agreement to cover noxious weed control than we've had in the past and of course it would apply to this project as well thank you councelor H um so I stand a whole 5 zero and um these grow everywhere where I live and they grow in my backyard even along fence lines and I have had to pull them out personally and then they do they spread like wildfire I can't stress that enough meaning it's the 14,000 seeds I believe it it's it's a real issue so um just wanted to to put that out there as having actually dealt with these weeds in my own backyard um it's a sign ific an issue thank you thank you council members for the discussion thank you secretary um uh so to get and I think that's a good segue to the next Point um uh did have a um as part of the pre-construction process a meeting with the Weed County Su uh the weed weed Department super is he the weed supervisor okay um in Morrow County to discuss the plan um I think one thing that came up besides this is that they when in our review and our discussion with him is that there is a requirement in the plan that was submitted to do an annual assessment and a annual weed management kind of more of an action plan on what exactly what treatments are going to be implemented and where on an annual basis um that wasn't clear whether the plan would require a uh preconstruction assessment and treatment plan to be prepared so that we know what's going to be done to eradicate uh some of the more problematic weed populations before they go in with additional equipment and disturbance and and can potentially buy them out so we are asking for that to be submitted to us for review and consultation with the weed supervisor um prior to construction as an additional language in the weed plan and that would be the the the more substan of change that we would be making based on these comments um next slide please um this is more of a a smaller change so I won't spend too much on time of the DPO does recommend um a uh change to the nest avoidance buffers for fenus Hawk nests um based on updated guidance from ODFW we included guidance from the Oregon conservation strategy um which is uh that construction activities during the sensitive Nest nesting and breeding seasons for fenus Hawk don't occur within 0.6 miles of an active rinus hawk nest um ODFW had let us know on the record of the DP or prior to the issuance with the DPO that they didn't think that um the the Oregon conservation strategy recommendation which is the most restrictive recommendation that's out there uh was warranted for this site and they thought a 0.5 mile setback would be accurate adequate um",

        "text": " quickly uh you'll recall in this case this is the the Nolan Hills uh case in which they have they're constructing wind turbines uh and Umatilla County has an ordinance that prohibits the construction of wind turbines within two miles of rural residences we had the contested case on this and we had before you last July an hearing uh the de applicant as well as the Department's position was that in spite of that ordinance you could approve the facility even though there were some turbin that would be less than 2 mil from rural residences and in your final order you provided a number of reasons justifications for that decision one you said uh that re that ordinance is not required by Statewide planning goals so it did not constitute an applicable Criterion alternatively you found that by Statute you are off authorized to approve a facility even if it doesn't meet a recommended applicable substantive Criterion from a from a county or a special Advisory Group if the facility otherwise complies with Statewide land use planning goals so you can say even if that ordinance is an applicable substantive Criterion we have the authority to approve it because we find it otherwise applies with all of the land use planning goals it was on that basis that alternative rationale that you provided in your final order that the Supreme Court affirmed your decision they didn't even get to the analyze whether or not the two mile setback is an applicable substantive Criterion or is required by the goals I said we don't even have to get to that because Council you even if it is you have the authority because you found that it otherwise complies with the goals so that is a 35 very much a reduced summary of the opinion uh if you have any if you get a chance to read it and you have questions about it beyond what I've just summarize just let me know and we can chat about it uh second update uh in the ongoing uh appeal of the EUR approval of Boardman to Hemingway Amendment one last month you'll recall I updated you that Idaho Power had petitioned for the Supreme Court to take take up the case in place of Union County Circuit Court this and we joined that that motion uh the Supreme Court as you as I mentioned last month denied to take the case up but in the course of their denying it they said council's decision on the on request for Amendment one approving it is final so because they affirmed that your decision was Final idah whole power this is just since our meeting last month idah whole power filed a motion to dismiss we also filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the case is moot there is no reason to proceed with having a contested case uh the petitioner requested a contested case uh among other reasons arguing that uh the notice that you had provided on the draft proposed order was insufficient uh and wanted to argue about that and again our argument in the most recently filed motion the motion to dismiss is given that the site certificate or the approval of the amendment uh has been confirmed as final by the Supreme Court the case is moot there is no point in having a contested case because it couldn't it couldn't change anything about that Amendment uh that has now been fully briefed and uh the court has heard oral argument we are hopeful that we'll get a decision from the court uh in a reasonable amount of time those are my updates this F thank you so much Mr row um okay so there are three projects we'd like to give you a snippet of an update on for this secretary report the first is another Boardman to Hemingway update um on April 16th uh just earlier this week the department issued its draft proposed order on requests for Amendment two for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line sight certificate so we now have an open comment period on that draft proposed order and on the complete Amendment request that comment period extends through May 30th uh where we are planning to have a hearing um in at the Port of Morrow in Borman quick reference so the changes that are being proposed by Idaho Power Company the certificate holder include shifts in the location of the transmission line temporary work areas and access new and substantial improved access roads uh it also includes construction and operation of a capacitor station that would be in Union County um changes to previously imposed conditions and a proposal to expand the site boundary and micro sighting areas note that the draft proposed order also includes changes to conditions that are recommended by the department so we are not limited and only evaluating what a certificate holder applicant propose as the conditions we have our own ideas about what those conditions need to do to ensure compliance with standards so that is interesting and just to highlight Council approved Boardman to Hemingway in September of 2022 it's now 2024 and what we've been processing are changes in the location of certain segments of the line and access roads and so it's just a very interesting experience to go through that wasn't the route that was feasible to use and so they have to keep adjusting as they work with land owners and experience um engineering constraints that might not have been known based on how they were able to evaluate it in the application with limited access excuse me Sarah yes um Cher Hall I just want to if I may and I don't know if this is appropriate so Patrick can tell me to shut up but I frequently in my regular life outside of this room outside of council and asked why does it Tak so long why can't anything get done and you just stated approval 2022 we are in 2024 and I would just like to state that we have an obligation a legal requirement for you just said a public hearing and I I want people to understand and my this is Marcy's opinion that's part of the process but that's part of the reason why the time and it has nothing to do with FC or or anyone Absolut I just I just want to I keep saying it over and over and over again and I just wanted to reiterate what you stated thank you okay great um the next project we'd like to give you a snippet update is on the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility which is in the notice of intent phase uh this is a proposed 2011 megawatt wind and solar facility to be located in Wasco County um so again this is in the notice of intent phase which is the very first of seven steps in the process um the notice of receipt of that notice of intent and a public comment period was issued on March 14th we held a public meeting on that notice of intent in the town of doofer on April 3rd and thank you council member berer for attending that was wonderful and the comment period on that notice of intent extends through May 3rd and just of note um to date we have received no public comments on that project um which is surprising but it's not May 3rd yet uh and then lastly um a project we really haven't talked about in a long time it's the Eugene to Medford transmission line requests for Amendment four uh this is an the Eugene to Medford transmission line is an existing operational transmission line it's one of council's oldest site certificates issued when I was 2 years old um uh 198 to um the certificate holder is pacificore and they submitted a preliminary requests for Amendment 4 in 2018 which proposed many things but predominantly a new 17-Mile transmission line and 500 KV substation it's been on hold our review of this amendment request has been on hold for nearly 2 years um really pending information needed to evaluate the significance of impacts of the substation to try resources um and a resolution to that issue has still not been achieved and there's been changes over time and even the need for the project so we received notification last week from Pacific cor that they were withdrawing that Amendment request um so we will be updating our web page to up update that status we haven't had a chance to do that so that Amendment request is no longer under review and then um a a brief compliance update um as you know we've been bringing amendments to mitigation plans to council for formal review when the changes being requested in a mitigation planned aren't that substantive we would present these amendments in the Council secretary report um so we had a request to amend several Wildlife monitoring TR and mitigation plans for um uh the Leaning Juniper 2A and 2B facility Klondike and Golden Hills and Montag wind project the Amendments across those Wildlife monitoring and mitigation plans are all the same where they're seeking to remove a requirement to evaluate Nest success as part of their long-term Raptor nness survey um it was an outcome of us finding non-compliance iance with that requirement because they weren't actually doing it and so the resolve was that we and aen grid who is the certificate holder worked with the Department of Fish and Wildlife to better understand what is this requirement doing and what do they need to do to fix it and it was that why are they needing to do it in the first place um which is so ODFW recommendation is that because there's no Baseline data to evaluate if there's a change and Nest success that is significant that it unevaluable um and that they already had an obligation to evaluate Nest occupancy which is a better criteria to evaluate changes over time from ODFW perspective and I apologize Nest success is the success of an a raptor using the nest and a fledgling hatching and flying off so that means you actually have to monitor pretty frequently to know the outcome which wasn't happening and then it turns out it doesn't really need to be so they're striking that requirement updating long-term Raptor nness surveys to occur on years divisible by five so that they don't have to do them actually every year across their facilities which is something that ODFW has been supportive of so those are amendments that we're recommending Council with any questions on that okay Sarah yes sir can you say Nest success three times Jordan right and uh secretary esterson amendments then subject the to it opens up just the amendment part right if there's been some new standard or something like that that's applied or not yeah it's kind of unfortunate to use the word amend but so the wildlife monitoring mitigation plans specifically but it also is in a lot of mitigation plans have a section in the plan that allows for plan amendments maybe we should just use the word plan revisions over time to make",

        "text": " values for so I just wanted to to raise that point thank you thanks Nick yeah and um at previous meetings we did discuss you know ways to improve um at least opportunities for consultation with with federal agencies or at least uh provide notice of when there is a proposed project in the vicinity of something that's designated as a protected area so that that's something we're also looking at but I I think that um is a good reminder now too that um notification and ongoing consultation are are um I think David who was next uh yeah thanks Chris I just wanted to put out there a couple just notes of caution about moving away from relying on you know State Regional and other plans to and and identifying what's resources should be protected under the scenic resources standard um the first being is that you know and I think some of the federal entities here identified it that a lot of these resources are recognized for different types of values even though whatever their name might be they may be designated for you know Scenic or other resources and and the plans are really the the best way to identify those um not only because well first off because they are they're they're done that's done through a very public process where there's public input um the more we move away from that like from and into just us on this call on this worksheet identifying what resources should be considered protected Scenic resources you move away from that public input from those folks that are most impacted by it people that live there that could or should or however you want to describe it designate it under their state city Regional plan I know I've heard some concerns about people upset that certain resources haven't been included or recognized in their plan but that's only that's only half of the story um there's a process to do that and the community has decided not to and I think that's what I'd caution you about about us trying to decide that oh no we know we know better than the local community we better than the planning processes and just we're just going to pick and choose here today and the second the second note of caution I'd provide is as you get as you move further into like private property designations even the conservation Banks or conservation properties the conservation easements there are inventories out there but they're not absolute and the only way you can identify a lot of these conservation easements is to do a title title search on actual property and while that may not be a big lift for a discreete facility of 20 30 Acres but on a large linear project that crosses multiple counties that becomes a big big lift and it's expensive and it's time consuming and it it's just a big lift to identify something that may or may not be significant and I can also tell you within those conservation eement they're not they're not blanket protect against development there's often exceptions that allow for some development that if we just put them all into this bucket wouldn't recognize what they're actually being protected for and that goes back to my point about the significance of having them go through a process a formal process of being part of a planning where people can talk about that and if they if a conservation easement holder wants to get their property designated as a protected area under some regulatory scheme they can do that but absent that no one has any input except for that landowner at this point in time or you me and everyone else on this call so I understand the interest but I also understand that there is a process for them to expand the scope of this this standard and I'd caution about just jumping forward without really thinking it through thanks David Angela yeah thanks um I have a couple comments um in terms of first in terms of trails so I'm an avid hiker and I have been on lots of trails where it may be a really fantastic Trail um overall but there are parts of the trail that are not fantastic or Scenic or beautiful but but you know Trails trails are long um and the same issue pops up with Scenic byways which are also very long and and not every part of that Scenic byway is Scenic by anyone's standard um and so I think when we're about um areas that are large like a trail or a Scenic byway I think we need to figure out some way to protect the scenic Parts but allow for development on the parts that are not the scenic um so I think we should look for a way to to thread that needle um and then my other point is about um you know when we're when we're talking about trying to figure out other scenic areas that are not on a list somewhere uh using a set of criteria instead that to me is a whole new process that has a lot of subjectivity to it and it sounds like it would take a really long time um to figure that out so you know if a if a study includes um well there's criteria and then um you know in the process we're arguing about the criteria and is this Scenic or is this not Scenic we're in a climate crisis and we feel it every year more and more we don't have time to be arguing about you know is this Scenic or not does this fit the criteria or not we need a list to comply with so that we're protecting our special areas now but that we're protecting our special areas in the future from climate change and all of the horrible impacts that we're seeing thanks Angel yeah I was going to say I think this issue relates to uh the the fact that you know under NEPA there can be these negotiated agreements with the state where uh in the NEPA review they do not do an assessment of like the historic properties and and viewscapes of those and I know I believe that if BLM is going to be doing these agreements we really need to look at having FS standards that are uh reasonably consistent with what BLM would require um I'm really concerned because when it comes to fsac their process means that they don't have to identify what the even what the impacts are going to be they say they are going to be impacts that's all they have to say to get a site certificate and they list a bunch of potential things that they might do to mitigate because of these impacts that we that the public doesn't know what they are the public never sees what the final analysis is as far as what the impacts are what the mitigation is going to be and as a result you have Odo and which we've already determined Odo gets paid by uh the developers and I mean your salary comes from directly from the developers and so if we don't have some kind of third party looking at at these issues to me it's very inappropriate for fsac to be evaluating for a NEPA process process if they don't have some kind of criteria that in some way relates to what NEPA would require um uh I I as I see it at least with the uh uh BLM line somebody needs to require BLM to do their own analysis because it's not being done by the state so um anyway that's my comment and a a serious concern I'd like to know who who you turn that over to as far as as a a u complaint I guess because the process is so dissimilar and like we've already said the fsac process for protected areas basically doesn't exist so the end thanks Irene and just because there's been several comments about the funding mechanism for this agency I will say that that's not something that we can address rulemaking that's probably not a surprise um and um yeah I will let um uh I think also you know what federal agency requirements are do are are what federal agencies are required to do it's also something that's outside of uh the of issues I can address but um or we can address the ru um but but yeah thank thank you for that um I I think in the interest of time I'm going to have uh looks like Rachel has her hands up and and Dean and then we'll move on to our our final issue about opportunities I thank you this is Rachel again um I wanted to just Echo briefly David and Angela's comments um just that I uh agree it would be a a pretty significant shift to go from uh important Scenic resources that are identified by existing public processes to it being uh an applicant responsibility uh on a project by project basis um that seems like shifting uh a sizable burden without um as Angela said a a clear process or way to do that in a reasonable way and timeline and also um trying to include public input uh I would encourage a a way that um goes back to thinking about how if they need support um just alternative ways that the existing processes can be supported to identify resources great thanks Rachel uh Dean do you want the last word on this topic absolutely I always love having the last word they always say first word or the last word you know last word is even better um back to question on inventory uh for service and BLM like I mentioned have these inventory methods one of the nice things about those methods is they Landscapes into roughly three categories a b and c we often call them a b and c a being deserving of the highest level of protection C being deserving of virtually no protection or very low level of protection scenically it may have other resources that that are worth protecting and then B being something in between and I think my experience has been so far that most of the energy proposals in Oregon are happening on either C or B type Landscapes not on the a Landscapes the a Landscapes are pretty pretty well protected that would include places like The kumia Gorge National Scenic area however we get encroachment on the boundaries of the scenic area and within the viewshed of the scenic area uh there are projects that have placed wind turbines for example you know right on the boundary of the national Scenic area where they're in Clear View From Within the national Scenic area so the kind of inventory that I'm suggesting is not endless it's not timec consuming uh and it's not without and and I don't think I actually think it would facilitate development of renewable energy in Oregon as opposed to making it more difficult and the reason is because it would set out clear standards a Landscapes you wouldn't build in those everybody knows that already you're not going to build a uh wind energy project or solar energy project on the slopes of Mount Hood for example uh B sea Landscapes should be given more or less a green light from a Scenic standpoint so if we had a good inventory is",

        "text": " your your question of uh what the small natural gas projects may be and those are um those are typically um small uh co-generation um and so if we look at the distribution geographically of small scale renewable energy projects in we can see that they are widely across across the state light blue dots here are representing projects of one megawatt or less uh the darker blue are representing uh produces between one and five megawatts the orange is between five and ten megawatts and the purple between and twenty megawatts um so if we if we look at the count there are there are a number of uh projects in each of these categories and they're again widely around the state uh around communities uh but also clearly uh you know um following uh a sense transmission now one thing that's uh important to note uh these are this map uh are in front of the media utility um if we put to book uh the commerce behind the meter commercial and residential uh projects here it would uh crowd the map out of the too much um but behind the meter projects are included these charts in both the commercial and residential side um so i'll just pause there to see if anybody has any questions about uh about that very high level uh summary of of uh the status of small renewable protests in john i have a question um and i'm not sure how to raise my hand here on is there a document that describes each of these projects somewhere you know a little you know locator and descriptor of each of these projects that that would be useful to see yes so um on the odo website we do have a a map that shows these projects and you can scroll over those and and see uh some uh information about each of the projects um and can certainly include it will include a link to that map in uh in the background materials that we send to the group and uh yes so so the these data come uh the odos facilities database and so so we obviously have location and capacity information but also some other you know other information around so average annual production i'm not saying any other questions so um question actually this is angela um i something he said um can you clarify what you said about net metered projects um i thought i heard you say they were included just not on the map but an earlier slide said this was only about resources eligible for the rps so if you could clarify so so um yes so the um you this map is just showing in front of the meter um um these of capacity editions do include uh commercial and residential behind the projects and acknowledging that commercial and residential uh behind the meter projects may not uh uh electricity may not uh qualify for the ideas this um we're still considering those as if they're solar projects they there that's solar is an rps eligible resource so we would it was we're certainly in this study uh considering behind the meter projects this moment i see well that's um that's sort of different from what i had understood because net meter projects are not eligible for the rps and so that makes sense i was pretty confused about your data when you had showed such a large small scale renewables after 2019 because if you take out net metered projects there actually was a decrease in small-scale renewable projects in oregon and so um i'm pretty confused about why net metered projects are included um i i don't think they should be i think it was pretty clear in legislative intent that when we're talking about small scale we're talking about rps eligible resources and i can direct you to representative helms statement on the record about that um but yeah our net metered project should not be included in this study that's oc is yeah yeah um that's that's a point we'll take it and something that that we can certainly um you know going back and and looking at that the legislative intent there um potential for is some of the some of the uh behind the meter projects that can um maybe uh combined with storage because you could certain resilience benefits to the community at large and so that's something we were thinking should be considered as we're looking at uh the types of projects that would be um uh we'll be investigating under the study um i mean i it's true that commercial and and well net meter projects will provide resiliency to communities but i believe the intent of this study is is not on net metered projects so happy to follow up with you we'll go ahead and talk internally about it too thank you so much for sharing that perspective um so i'll move on now to just uh um cover some of the the subtopics that the group will be investigating again um you know i just i want to point out that in these slides i'm just pointing out some examples of potential research objectives and potential research methods um again we want this to be driven by the work group itself uh so the intent here is to just uh to give a primer on what we'll be asking about in the questionnaire as we help define the objectives and and so the first is on potential opportunities and barriers for small-scale renewable energy projects um you know the uh potential opportunities uh that such projects could bring to the state include um achieving uh deep carbonizational clean energy goals uh improving access to clean energy among community members local economic environmental benefits mitigation of land use conflicts and local energy resilience and some of the barriers uh noted in in the statute that uh two small-scale projects can include uh land use conflicts or uh transmission capacity issues um the ability to interconnect projects um or project implementation uh costs and um so uh the the the idea of the research objective around this topic is identification and studying opportunities and barriers to small-scale renewable energy projects and where possible identifying strategies and to take advantage of those opportunities and and to mitigate those barriers uh for for projects that may have their benefits to uh to our opinions and some potential research methods we propose using would be literature reviews uh in-depth interviews with stakeholders uh and uh and regional and national experts um before you go on we've had just a little bit of chat activity on the conversation on nut metering and i just want to acknowledge it we see it we see a couple of people representative owens and orianna magnero weighing in that the net metered projects were not intended to be included we hear you we'll talk about it we'll be we'll have an answer back for everybody sometime soon thanks for that um the second workshop uh topic will be on uh access and ownership opportunities so small-scale community-based renewable energy projects could have do have the potential to improve access and uh opportunities for communities with limited access and infrastructure and uh can also provide opportunities for uh for diverse models of ownership by local governments uh nonprofit organizations or cooperatives of community members and uh the uh so research objectives for the uh around this topic area would be the work group to identify and study strategies and models uh including uh investigating opportunities benefits barriers costs and risks uh that can increase access and promote diverse ownership of small-scale renewable energy projects um and the potential research methods uh include literature review and again in-depth interviews with stakeholders and regional national experts workshop uh we're proposing would look at potential economic resilience as well as great impacts of small-scale renewable energy projects the uh so small-scale community-based renewable energy projects uh cannot uh present opportunities to to uh to create local economic benefits you know direct impacts uh from projects that include increased direct employment and in construction or operations of renewable energy projects uh local tax revenues uh to uh cities and counties um or reduced household or energy uh business energy expenses uh indirect impacts you know project such as this could generate uh increased local spending or increased employment in related industries uh for example and then uh induced impacts uh being um so the the tertiary uh increased household business income which can help generate more economic activity in communities and increase local employment in other industries and uh for example as retail or service uh and so uh the research objective around around this topic would be for us to identify and quantify uh potential economic benefits of small-scale renewable energy projects using methods such as literature review in-depth interviews with stakeholders regional and national experts as well as conducting economic impacts analysis um you know that's a um i think we would uh endeavor you know the economic impact analysis to uh to um you know conduct uh do um as rigorous analysis as as we can obviously but um depending on tools and resources available um we we will depend on how deep we can go for that influence um and the uh potential resilience benefits is another uh topic consideration of the the work group resilience you know community energy resilience can include activities like uh preparation for energy service disruptions mitigation of risks for assistive hazards uh being able to respond to disruptions and energy services quickly and then recover as quickly as possible and restore energy services and small-scale community-based renewable energy can play a role across those activities um and have the potential to for example uh minimize impacts acute disruptions to the energy system or harden critical infrastructure emergency service for example emergency services and support emergency response as well as provide emergency and energy services to uh so uh research excuse me john i was just wondering i had my hand up and that's um when you're ready could we go back a few slides i have a question that i had to look something up before i asked it and um it would it would be the um it would be the slide that has the um it's it's got a bullet point of access what uh let's see yeah maybe my question can just or maybe my point will just wait as we see how things develop here a little bit so um it can i appreciate that thanks so much so uh uh with regards to the potential uh resilience benefits of projects um the research objective here for this study could be to identify those resilience benefits categories and potentially identify methods for quantification of those benefits um potential research methods will include again literature review uh uh consultation with stakeholders and experts um and then uh investigating and evaluating uh different uh value of resilience methodologies that have um that that are uh available um and have covered a focus of some research attention over the last few years and then lastly uh certainly obviously potential rate impacts um so small-scale community-based renewable energy projects um you may have the potential for increasing or or decreasing retail electricity rates um and uh so one of the objectives of the the study will be to assess those impacts um and of uh projects at different scales of",

I'll let Tom introduce himself hi everybody Tom Cecilia uh hydrogeologist and Sarah L Tang uh good morning I'm Sarah levang and I am the Hanford ecologist working on the natural resource damage assessment and Matt Hendrickson good morning all Matt Hendrickson also with Odo radioactive waste remediation specialist so I do a lot study up the tanks up there at Hampford okay thank you very much uh Lura Felman would you like to offer a land acknowledgement yes thank you we respectfully acknowledge that our advocacy activism and learning takes place on lands we inhabit throughout Oregon and Washington cared for by indigenous tribes and bands since time began the Hamford nuclear weapons site encompasses culturally significant lands belonging to the Wanapum the confederated tribes and bands of the AKA Nation the confederated tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation the n Pur and Spokan Indian Reservation we acknowledge the economic and social values including systemic racism classism and the disregard for indigenous black and immigrant communities that made harm to this place possible the interconnectedness of the people the land and the natural environment cannot be overstated the health of one is necessary for the health of all we recognize the pre-existing and continued sovereignty of these tribes and thank them for continuing to share their traditional ecological knowledge and perspective on how we might care for one another in the land we are honored to be guests here we commit to working towards the cleanup and restoration of the Hamford site that is based on the future tribal use and stewardship of these lands and these Waters thank you Laura Mark Reese sent the uh October meeting summary out does anyone have any comments or changes to that summary does anyone have any objections to approving the meeting summary by consent okay meeting summary is approved um next item on our agenda is the US Department of energy update Delmar noise and Roger Gordon will be giving that update we're a few minutes ahead of schedule are they on uh online Mark hi Gary good morning yes I I see both delmare and Roger up so uh let's see we've got Delmar up so let me go on and pull up his presentation for and let me know when you can see it I can see it so please proceed thank you appreciate it and thank everybody for the time this morning and uh with the weather uh the ability to meet virtually is is very nice it sounds like somebody is having a a major house is I know one of our staff members had a major flood that they're dealing with as well so my my name is delar noise I'm the assistant manager for tank waste operations the tank Farms change the name but the same function uh with office of river protection and we'll talk a little bit about the test bed initiative demonstration and then Roger Gordon will follow and give you probably what's more exciting is some of the updates on what's happening with the low activity waste in the wtp project uh so next slide please so just uh start with a kind of an overview the the test bed initiative concept overview is is basically uh and I'll go through this again in more detail but at the high level is a a demonstration of removing the supernate out of an existing double Shell tank it happens to be sy101 uh with a filtration and uh treatment system that's in the tank uh same essential Technologies as the tank side season removal system same resin pre-t waste we brought to the surface confirmed in a delay tote and then approximately 2,000 gallons uh collected for this demonstration so um The Next Step really is working through the process of outsight disposal of this low activity waste and uh that's really what this is demonstrating on a regulatory perspective uh we picked sy1 one for several factors uh it has a large level of liquid waste which means all the solids have settled out uh so this system is designed for only that very low solid uh liquid waste um and it's located in our West Farm area so these activities are not impacting any of our DF law prep activities um that's the direct feed low activity waste uh facility that Roger will talk about and all the preps that I'm doing in tank Farms to uh start up and commission that facility so this is in the west area away from that and it was also selected among other things uh uh it is a double Shell tank so it is a permitted system we have three of these tanks in the west area so this is one of the three um obviously we currently have radioactive waste stored in these tanks and as I mentioned this tank has a lot of liquid radioactive waste and intank pre-treatment system will be installed in a riser and that's what you see kind of here in the picture listed as number two um and it basically will have a pumping capability that will send waste the pump will be in the bottom through a filter unit um and then through an ion exchange unit so the waste brought to the surface will be only the pre-treated waste and all the mechanical pie pieces are within the tank and within the tank ventilation system essentially what we're doing here is removing the cesium because that's the bulk of the Radioactive in the liquid fraction and uh based on tiser operations to give you a sense of efficiency we're moving 99.99% of that cesium uh greater than that uh before it's brought to the surface uh waste will be then sent to this delay tote um that is where we do confirmation that in fact uh the pre-treated waste is at the surface and nothing unexpected happens um and then it'll be moved over to the the storage totes um we have six of those totes uh they have about a 350 thou 50,000 350 gallon excuse me uh capability and they'll be filled to about 333 gallons so about 1,900 uh gallons will be totally processed in these four totes and these are certified due compliant Transportation containers so we we call them totes but they are uh certified Transportation containers as well um so basically at the completion of the on-site operations all six of those toads would be staged for off-site treatment and Disposal uh once we have uh the operations done and it's be a very quick operation when the system's installed and permitted it's only a couple week operation um and then samples will be taking of the pre-treated waste to confirm all the radiological and organic and chemical compositions uh that is a an extensive uh sampling and an anal process uh to a sample analysis plan that's three to 6 months in in duration after we've confirmed uh the treatment and the composition we'll split the sample take two of the totes to uh Intergy Solutions in Clive Utah which has uh the disposal facilities already on board that we would meet the Mac excuse me waste acceptance criteria at that facility and then the other half at Waste Control specialists in Andrews County Texas uh the sample analysis will include physical organic inorganic and and radiological uh chemistry elements and it'll be published in a final report uh that will support the shipment paperwork so these are commercial vendors and I mentioned the totes will be divided in half and three cent to each each of these vendors um and uh with that the other supporting stuff uh since this is is tank waste a couple other Preparatory activities have already been completed uh the first on the radioactive waste manage M we did evaluate the proposed 2,000g waste stream and determined it was waste incidental incidental to reprocessing I.E not highlevel waste and can be satisfactory managed by low as lowlevel radioactive waste similarly with what we have been done uh with the tiser operations um again that's only applies to this 200 gallon demonstration we also completed and I should back up on that that really includes looking at the waste and confirming that it's when it's solidified it's appropriate for land disposal it will be compliant with the disposal facility and characterized to meet the waste acceptance criteria we also in parallel produced the NEPA documentation for this activity and again I focus the EA the evaluation was only for the 2,000 gallon demonstration that we're doing here with a finding of no significant impact for both commercial facilities and Transportation uh to both commercial facilities doar could you uh go into a little more detail about the transportation where moving liquids correct what kind of uh uh Transportation Arrangements have been made and what is the route um I'd be happy to uh I I'll jump to that and come back so basically basically as I mentioned uh the waste is is pre-treated with 99.99% of the radioactiv activity removed uh but the chemicals remain um that would be packaged in these totes as I mentioned those are DOT certified Transportation uh containers that would be then uh truck chipped to each of the vendors uh as you mentioned in the liquid G form so about 1,000 gallons um it would be then uh grouted at the uh facilities and dispos in those facilities to their",

Duly recognized this fifth day of December, 2023, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by our clerk, Gregory C. Harrell. And I just want to first tell the public that these are amazing organizations. I'm going to pass the mic around for them to also share some additional details about themselves. Additionally, we are going to be highlighting these organizations in the coming weeks and throughout the year ahead. And yes, that means our PR group is actually going to visit their organization. They are going to give you a little inside peek as to exactly what all that was listed here looks like and we just can't thank them enough for the good work that they do. So I'll start here. April Lesage I'm with sheltering hands. Mainly. I help with the trapping for Kat Marian and we greatly appreciate the community and the involvement they are doing with this. It is making a huge impact. My name is Aspen Olmsted. I'm the director for quality of Life rehab and Foster. We help in the capacity of trapping and transport for the most part because we don't have a clinic. And again, we're really grateful to the community and everybody on this stage for supporting this effort. Thank you, guys. Good morning. I'm Debbie Carney. I work part time for vocal as a TNR coordinator as well as we have been blessed with donations from Chewy. So we have a food warehouse for rescues as well as people in need, but very thankful to be a part of this. We also have a clinic, so we're thankful to be able to do surgeries. Myself and Carla here are what I like to call special kind of crazy because it does take that to load your car up with cats that are not usually happy about it and they may leave you some presents, but it's what we do and we feel very passionate about it. So thank you for everyone because it does take a village, and this village is awesome. So thank you. Good morning. Eddie Leedy with the Humane Society of Marion county. First, like to thank the commission for this recognition and the continued support they give for all the rescues. We want to also thank each and every person that's on this stage. We couldn't do what we do without the partnership that we have here in Marion county and the cooperation we have. Elena, the shy one here on the end, is excellent at organizing, getting resources together. We do shelter, do surgeries at the humane society. So each person here has a very important role in this, and that's how we get the job done. So everybody here is being really modest about what they do. So we've done 910 cats so far in a year, and 910 cats when two cats get together in eight years, that's 2.1 million cats. So think about the numbers that we're saving. So we're helping animals or helping people, too, because people are getting overwhelmed with the number of cats. I just want to point out some of these people are really quiet about what they do, but it takes a lot of effort and energy to do the surgeries and be on your feet all day dealing with these cats. It takes a lot of energy to be out till 05:00 in the morning trapping cats and bringing them in. They're being really quiet and shy about their efforts. April mentioned that she's trapper. April is the admin person behind all of Kat Marion. She makes sure we line up all the trappers, have trapper meetings. She goes through all the applications we get. So I'm going to ask all of you, would you mind giving these people a big round of applause before their work and to close us out with these organizations is our Marion County Animal services director. Again. Thank you, commissioners. I just want to echo what everybody else has said. We can't do this as just one agency at all. We need everybody here to do it. We need the support of my amazing team to my left and then everybody else to keep helping us out, too. And we're looking forward to making those numbers even higher in the coming, coming months, coming years. Thank you. Thank you all again. And we're going to hand out these certificates. So if you'll give us just a moment and then we'll grab a couple of photos. Good morning. Nice seeing you. I think that's. Thank you. Kitty cat Jaguar pin today. Just because I'm a cat lover. Yes, but I'm also a dog lover. Mister Stone is the cat lover on the commission? Yeah. I'm the dog, you're the cat. I love them all, but kitty cats reside with me. So that's going to take us into our public comments, and I did not have anyone sign up in advance for public comments. However, if there is something on this agenda that you would like to discuss and bring forward at this time, I'm going to invite you to come forward to one of the mics. Seeing none, I'll close public comment and we'll just move forward. There will be another opportunity to discuss anything that's not on the agenda at the close of our meeting today. So that will take us into. Mister clerk, item number five for budget amendments. Thank you, madam chair. Good morning. Have for the board's consideration and adoption budget amendment resolution items 511 through 514. I'll bring it to the board for any discussion or a motion to approve. So moved. Second, have a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by commissioner McLean. All in favor with indicate with an I. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, madam chair. We next have item 521, which is a disposition of property form authorization. Commissioners, if you've had a chance to review that one particular disposition, I'll bring it to the board for action. Motion to approve 521. Have a motion by Commissioner Curry with a second by Commissioner McLean. All in favor indicate with a nice. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you, madam chair. Finally, item 522 is a request for approval of the annual budget and capital improvement program calendar. Commissioners, if you've had a chance to look that over. Motion to approve 522. 2nd, have a motion by Commissioner McLean with a second by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor indicate with an aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you so very much. And seeing as we still have a few minutes before we move to our public hearings, I'll take us into our consent items and I will ask. I'll start with my right. Is there anyone who needs to pull an item on consent? Yes. 721721 will be pulled to my left. Okay, then, while bring it back to the balance, with the exception of 721 for a motion, I'll move the balance of the consent agenda. Have a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by Commissioner Zalick. All in favor indicate with an aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. And Commissioner Bryant, seven two one. I just want to. I'm having a senior moment this morning and I want to know, are we. Will this change make the rents less or make them more? Inspector? It will make it more. It will increase the rents, but only because the. For seven units, because the AMI is being increased to under 25%. That's what I was. That's what I was thinking. I just wanted to make sure that. So I'll go ahead and move. Seven, two, one. Thank you. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by Commissioner Zalick. All in favor indicate with an aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. That is going to take us now to item number eight. And I don't believe our attorney had anything unless things changed overnight. Okay. And our county administrator still has none. I have nothing listed under my section, commissioner, but I would like to bring an item forward, please. Item 14. One. One. I would like to introduce to the board our new HR director, Sarah Carone. And she comes to us from Putnam county, and she is up to take your test today and answer your questions. Well, Sarah, we welcome you to Marion county, and we certainly also would like to put you on the spot since you've been called. I got my tap pants and shoes on, so I'm ready. Actually, we just invite you to introduce yourself to us as well as the public. Okay, great. My name is Sarah Carone. I actually grew up and was born and raised in Gainesville. And I have over 15 years of experience in government HR, both with the county of Putnam and the Florida Department of Health. Wonderful. Well, we certainly welcome you to Marion county, and I'll open it to the board. Anyone have any comments, questions? Sure. I always have. Well, welcome to the best team and the best job of your life. That's what I've heard. Legit. I definitely heard that first, depending on what team you get on. She has not been introduced to the colors yet. Oh, well, you know that comes in the second day, right? Yes. Anyway, so. But have you, what's been the best thing or, or most thing that you're most proud of in regards to hr over the 15 years that you've. Gosh, that has put me on the spot. That's our job. I think some of the best things I've done is implement some really good training and mentoring programs for the organizations that I've worked for. And I really love growing employees and promoting from within and teaching them what they need. Having that opportunity for employees who maybe never thought",

        "text": " opportunity to speak to that um because if you we want to make it a collaborative effort so you're not surprised later when a condition comes out that wasn't there so um for safety reasons I think at least um a reconsideration of the lining of the parking spaces so they um encourage oneway traffic pattern is going to be um I'm going to bring it up under discussion for condition okay yeah um we actually are new site plan which um that we've been working on to try to improve the site uh increases the Landscaping planter right off the driveway so it gives enough room that parking is slightly you know shifted south of the site so it's not backing up into the driveway itself um so we believe with we can address your concerns with signage and you know better directional arrows and um striping uh so that they have enough room that when they do back up they can and see you know clearly that they're not supposed to go that way Additionally the site currently works that you know cars come in that way they know not to go out uh so customer base kind of already understands the circulation of the site oh boy I've seen people go out that driveway though and it is it is not can I ask a clarifying question yeah you had mentioned our our new site plan is is that the site plan that we have in our current binder or is there another site plan yes yes you have a new one or yes this is the current one no the you have the current one sorry thanks okay any other questions of applicant before we close the public because I got some okay great uh so thank you for the presentation and thanks for being available U really it I have a few questions related to um if we can go to uh c-1 or at least the uh the blow up of the there we go right there the so I noticed that there's a proposed EV charging station now is this going to be uh do we have any details on the proposed EV charging station is this just a oneoff that we have like an e an EV charger like a little uh charge point or do we have some plans through Chevron for example with newer technology do we have anything at this time I'll have to defer to BU you can grab a seat I should just grab a seat that's true yeah um they're still developing the EV technology that they're going to be using at their sites the one we're showing is a free wire unit I don't know if you're familiar with that unit it's a battery boost system um you know doesn't require you know direct feed from the Transformer so that's the one we're showing because it's the biggest and the most U difficult to access so if we can make that fit we can make anyone fit great and so the proposed bottle storage building that what type of bottles are those can you explain it's the recycle recycling recycling standard now would reorientation of the parking conflict with the proposed future EV station potentially but um you so angling the parking is going to eliminate a parking stall we we plan to eliminate a parking stall but we're afraid that we might wind up eliminating to by angling them and so we're willing to continue that discussion with Gan after the close of the public hearing sure um in your experience and through I guess Communications with Chevron other Chevron locations I know that this doesn't meet the threshold for bike storage for long-term bike storage I'm wondering we have a small proposed two capacity bike rack if you have any details on staff or other that do commute to Chevron locations using bikes um something to consider as we transition uh obviously this is a a gas station um but bike usage uh may be going up and I think a long-term solution for a bike might be something to consider um I'm just going to table that and put out there another question that I had though is um under our code I think it was 16 basically there is a section for solar and I'm wondering if this proposal on on top of the convenience store has or will be wired for solar solar panels on top of the roof rooftop solar oh that's a good question um you know I think we're all heading in that direction it's the states that are you know south of us are already doing it I you know there's legislation for Washington to do it some point it's going to be here I don't it's a problem for us to provide future you know uh access to solar panels on this roof it is a flat roof and we do have the capacity to do it I don't know if they're willing to commit to it at this but I guess the question is then would the preliminary plan set have to include you know pre-wired situations or you know conduits for rooftop as part of the the site plan I wouldn't think so they could be retrofit so all right yeah sorry degree and that's I understand that we don't have a a paint pallet um or anything on our code at this time something that we'd like to work on um so what is it that uh are we trying to go for like a matching of the existing canopy or is this a no I wouldn't say that you know the the extra mile convenience store has its own identity you know you know there's Chevron gas extra mile convenience store just like Arco hasm or you know Melle has I don't know what they have but um so you know there there's a distinct identity differential between those two businesses and actually extra mile is owned by a different entity so this isn't necessarily a Chevron project this is it it is because it because Chevron is a part owner of the extra mile brand okay so what I'm concerned with is eventually having a brand new extra mile that's all razzled Dazzle looks nice and fits in and then 1970s or 80s Chevron fuel canopy kind of conflicting Aesthetics can you speak to that they're not going to change that Chevron brand for many many years to come so there's no plan to merge those two entities together or to change the architecture that Chevon identity is has been on the street for a long time and I anticipate they're going to leave it that way for as long as they possibly can it's very identifiable right so yeah okay that's all I have thank um one more question on the garbage and the N the this is your tenant's concern correct so um Oil Stop is your tenant it's Che yeah Chevron the owner's tenant yes Chevron the well it's a tenant of the site yeah exactly um so can you speak to the concern about the because I'm looking at the site plan and it looks like you're providing a 24 foot wide driveway so it would be a two-way driveway between the existing Car Wash and the existing oil and I'm just trying to where the red line is two-way traffic that looks like it's greater than 24 feet but I can't tell what's just below the red dotted line is that a what is that is that a like a drainage yeah that's a sale that's the s in the in the ground in the in ground sale so that must be like a 35 foot driveway or something if I had to guess so there's two ways in it look at that that was that might help so um can you take it back to that other picture that was kind of so reoriented myself so you're going to the you see where the the convenience store is today yeah so we're directly it right there right there so it's going to be on the backs side of the oil change place correct and so the the driveway between so when someone exits the car wash that's not going to impede their outbound the oil can or the oil stop goes through and they exit that way around the garbage yeah and this big building's going to be gone yeah that building and they you know the the exiting for the oil stop as they come out of the Bays can turn left and go out to Langer that way as well to right okay I just wanted to when you're only looking at this part of it because that's all that we're supposed to look at this picture gives orients us to you know there's going to be a garbage area someplace but this is not going to impede their ability to get in and out okay okay I just want to make sure that and I don't see another spot that the pr disposal would be able to access easily without taking away significant parking spots like all trash it we spend more time on figuring out where the trash goes than any other part of our site layout you need it but you don't want it to be Primary in your thing all right so are there any other questions of the applicant before we close the public hearing and go to deliberation yeah I do okay actually just a little bit more in the trash speak of the topic um but it I'm trying to orient a little bit better so it looks like it's actually going to stick out a ways into that kind of driveway right there or what appears to be the driveway is that is that right do you anticipate that being a problem I mean I guess you still have the same you have the right width for the rest of the area but you're going to kind of have this sort of blank spot behind the driveway past that other building then right which is technically where they need to park see okay oh we they're parking okay okay so those are parking stalls for the other building and so it'll be it'll work out okay all right the other okay then the other question I have here is on the Underground storage units or storage tanks those look kind of like they're where the current building is is that right approximately right so shifting that North yeah yes they're shifting to the north okay so what's happening to the old storage tanks they they're out they're coming out are they in the same spot they're no they're just so our the tank hole is just south of that of where we're placing the new tanks okay okay so it's so what's coming out is still within the overall major modification right so that they're not like underneath where the canopy is you have to dig any of that up then okay so it really is all within this area that you're wested so they'll come out and then these go in right there okay okay all right and there's I guess reviews as to there's probably standards of how these things get removed and all that stuff these days guess yeah okay dressed yeah okay all right thank you right any other questions all right and then I just did for the record I went past the site um",

        "text": " um so obviously there are you know senior people who who have oversight over that but there's a lot of work that's done by the actual students uh in that program so the Oregon Department of energy on behalf of the energy facility sighting Council was not timely notified uh per o 345 03010 sub2 um which requires prompt notification by telephone of the occurrence of any incident or condition relating to the operation of the reactor that could have prevented a nuclear system from performing its safety functions as described in the technical specification so they basically should have let us know what happened um so max Woods who most of you know pretty well who is now the assistant director for nuclear safety and emergency preparedness um he has been in contact with the nuclear Regulatory Commission um they were timely notified of this incident so while we were not they were um per council's rules if there is a follow-up report to the nuclear Regulatory Commission then FC will receive a copy of that report so very likely um readed uh will create a report send it to NRC and then we will get a copy of that and then we will provide that to you so right now um well in the near future uh we've requested that Max reach out to the Reed College staff to set up a meeting to have a conversation about what those protocols should or shouldn't be um to make sure that we do receive proper notification if there is a future incident question this is vice chair con so they didn't timely so what did they just not National Regulatory Commission in lie of us and just we were forgotten in that I believe we were just forgotten it um so you know it's obviously the nuclear Regulatory Commission you know if there are nuclear facilities you know have staff and there's a lot of I think connection between these facilities and the nuclear Reg commission you know they have most of the uh oversight um but there is a site certificate there is requirement um so I mean I can't say what what why we weren't notified that's a requirement they should have done it so that's why we just want to make sure we have a meeting with them and kind of go over you know remind them you have a site certificate there are these administrative rules which require you to do certain things and the council does have you know some oversight not as much as the nuclear Regulatory Commission or should we but being you know at the state level I think that's it's appropriate you know um it was deemed to be appropriate a long time ago and they need to be adhering to those requirements what is prompt just as soon as yeah you know we have some you know that say 72 hours or you know other specified um the language of this one I think is literally just um prompt notification by telephone so thank you all right moving on to legislative updates um so the short session finished and um I've given updates on a couple or a few bills so I'll give the final version of those bills so House Bill 4015 would Define or did Define battery energy storage systems in FC definitional statutes um so they still didn't create a regulatory path either at the state level or the local level I guess it did some degree created at the state level um but this is for Standalone battery storage systems which are not FC jurisdictional um they weren't before and they aren't now um what the build did is it defined it in you know what a battery energy storage system is and then it creates an oped in by developers there's currently for other facilities that are less than FC jurisdictional there is option for the developers to opt into fsec there are also options for the local governments to defer to FC after consultation with the developer so that's what the bill did um I think there's a likelihood moving forward that there are going to be Standalone battery energy storage systems coun has reviewed I just pulled the numbers recently about 4 gaw of battery energy storage active battery energy storage systems right now these are related in supporting facilities so they're not your jurisdiction because it's a battery energy storage it's your jurisdiction because it's part of a wind or solar or natural gas um project that is your jurisdiction so it' be something like an onm building or a transmission line so that's why you know we have so review of these but you know if somebody came in today and said I want to build a you know Standalone battery energy storage project not not FC jurisdiction unless they unless they opt in counselor buyer just a quick question if a developer opts in for a standalone battery storage facility um do we apply our typical sighting standard yes it would be there's no difference in process okay thank you and there's no difference in the standards that would apply right thank you madam shair Council um if um they did an independent battery storage and it was not subject to our approval whose review would it be under it would be the local government's review um so either the city or the county um within whose jurisdiction the project would be located and then subject to whatever the zoning ordinance is for that particular Zone whether it's exclusive Farm use or industrial or commercial um to my knowledge the only Standalone battery energy storage system that exists in Oregon is in Salem Portland General Electric owns it it's in city limits um not FC jurisdictional we several years ago toured the facility uh which was um but you know so they can be located pretty much um anywhere you know that's in a building and there's a bunch of batteries sort of on racks more like a server room is what it looks like um but we're obviously seeing you know ones you know out on the landscape that are more like in containers so there's there are variations in the way these things are developed but I think you know at least the ones that are coming to FC as part of others are more in these sort of container unit type situations so um councelor Condon again a followup to councelor Devin's do you as these proliferate or proliferate was there do you know if there was any discussion about possible FC jurisdiction just for these Standalone units that are bigger I we've got some experience certainly with assessing them any idea on the conversations that took place uh I don't know that that anybody was advocating for FC jurisdictional or FC jurisdiction you know sort of right out of the gate um we'll see how these move forward you know we've had some projects where you know it's been they've been quite large uh in terms of the physical footprint so you know we'll see if that translates into you know the legislature or others wanting and I know like you know I think at least from the development Community they want the opin option um but you know I think probably local governments um and in fact there were um quite a few tracking the bill quite a few local governments that participated and commented and they did not like the opt-in provision they wanted to retain jurisdiction okay thank you one last question councelor Devin this is just a hypothetical but in most cases if a party built a battery storage it would receiving power from one of their other facilities in a different location has there been any instance that you know of maybe not in Oregon of somebody siding a battery storage in an area with low power rates like a co-op storing the power and then reselling it when the market is at the prices uh so for the record Todd cornette um thank you council member dein no I'm not aware of of the circumstance is I mean the the way that it's articulated and this is not necessarily the the entire universe of of possibilities but the way is typically um articulated is you know as we're moving towards renewable more more Reliance on renewable energy which is intermittent um you know the solar panels only work when you know the sun is out and the wind turbines only work when the the wind is out um that you know and sometimes those create excess capacity meaning there's more there's more production than the grid can take and so the basic idea there then is to have you know battery storage that can take that Excess power hold it you know for 12 hours and then release that onto the grid when you know the solar panels aren't producing power or the wind turbines aren't producing power um but I have not heard um the circumstances council member Devin that that you just articulated Madam chair um I I we should encourage actually you projects uh battery storage uh because of the issues that the secretary has cited and the fact that sometimes they can't sell their power sometimes they produce more of their power but what I would hate to see is some sort of speculative um way in which somebody might try to utilize low rates that might be available in a co-op uh and then to sell the power on the Open Market at the highest rates that they could get over a period um also I would hope that the local governments and I would assume that they would they would they would consult with their local energy provider um because some extra loads uh that are not anticipated uh can cause difficulties for some of those providers thank you councelor Devon I I do think it's a really interesting uh question yeah for us all to contemplate yeah no I hadn't contemplated that you know again the you know all the conversation has been about sort of the circumstances that that I talked about but never had heard that one so that is interesting thank you um next House Bill 4090 so that was a proposal to eliminate FC jurisdiction on projects that are entirely proposed on federal lands that did not move forward so that one um did not get through the Senate process it got through the house but not the Senate um and then finally House Bill 1525 so this was a as I indicated before a much larger Bill uh one component was Portland General Electric um made an amendment to that um that would um allow for standby generators to be connected to the electrical grid and dispatched to the Grid in certain circumstances so if you recall you know in order for a uh a standby generator you know as defined it couldn't be connected to the grid um so they this bill changed that that standby generators can be connected to the grid and in certain circumstances they can provide power to the grid um and then it still retains that they're not F sector rical or they're exempt from FC jurisdiction so essentially as I stated before this would create a functional peer plant um a cumulative peer plant across you know an area you know you have a lot of data centers have diesel backup generators you know Intel Oregon",

        "text": " um on those routes so that was that was an overview of our our routing study now for for the FC process we need to identify a site boundary um in in the noi and kind of moving forward and this basically what this represents is the potential temporary or permanent disturbance as a result of the project this this yellow polygon is much larger than than we're going to need for the project we we kept it a little bit larger on the CDA um so when we do further surveys before we submit the application we're going to need to do cultural surveys we're going to need to do biological surveys some other engineering work it gives us some latitude if there's things that we discovered to engineer around that um and in this you'll also see there's there's a lot of um while there are a lot of straight lines some of the lines that dip out that are kind of like semicircles around the corners those are um more for temporary servants for pulling and tensioning S so when you string the the line the conductor up um you need a little bit more room to pull that line um to to tighten it and so that's what that represents and when we when we actually um prepare our application and and move forward we we expect that this area is going to shrink as we have a little more confidence in in the actual areas that we need for um plan to so going through the schedule here um some of this stuff Chase has already talked a little bit about just kind of recapping we took about a year to for the routing study we took a lot of time um I mean the desktop part is quick the the part that takes a little bit more time is meeting with with land owners and stakeholders and um as a as a result of some of that initial Outreach we do feel confident in in the the rout Alternatives we have going forward um we did submit the noi to to Odo on 13th um we're anticipating um Quarter Two to have the our application in large the big big reason for this is there's a a Washington ground squirrel survey that needs to be done in April May and so that that's an annual survey it's it's the only time a year you can do that survey and so that's that's kind of a big driver why um we're we're looking at submitting this that this application a little bit after that final order site certificate so again this this is there's there's different factors that are that are um out of out of our control and and Odo obviously processes things as quick as they can this is just an anticipated time frame around quarter one um 2025 which would mean we would be ready to start construction Quarter Two and and have things um wrapped up by the end 2025 I'm going to hand this back over to West talk about the Outreach we've done thank you Derek and again thank you CH the department and the council for allowing us to talk about the project as you can see on the screen there's materials that we have put together leading up to tonight's meeting and we continue to produce materials to help communicate this projects available around the room if you are interested there are there's a 11 by 17 map foone boards around the room if you're interested for those you're virtually in in person as well we do have a website umcc pro.com that has a lot more of this information as well as an email atcc Pro electric.com if you have any questions or concerns and with that I would like to pass it back to thank thank you very much we're we're now open up our Q&amp;A portion of the evening public comment Oni this slide this slide explains how to participate in our Q&amp;A portion we questions and comments from people in room person tonight we'll follow iners commenters by people on the webinar itself the phone if there's numerous people wishing to comment tonight we may need to impose time limit comments respectful everyone has an opportunity to questions comments uh okay in person let's see our first com she Jeremy Jeremy would you like com thank you very much okay good evening all my name is Jeremy L I currently reside years um IW 125 represents approxim construction ibw 125 supports the Ella model County gentic project and has no opposition we support the proposed RS me and opposition to the alternate routs because we are confident that the possesses the necessary organizational experience and will meet its obligations under the oron energy facility sighting council's various standards including those focus on for tomorrow with count and Marrow County have continued to be leaders in our state in the Pacific northquest regarding energy related issues and they have done so by meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders including tribal government and land with increased energy needs combined with pressures to me clean energy gos this project is critical Eastern orans economic climate and overall energy go we offer our support Elric the Y Martin County connect project is an important partal infrastructure that will support resiliency goals while providing new opportunities for the area which will boost economic opportunities while F efcs sc's standards don't create jobs and it is important to know that this project will provide a significant number a family W jobs that will allow many workers the opportunity to work locally these types of projects may offer new career options for under represented communties without leaving Easter Oregan in Sun we respectfully request C thank you uh next on my Comon cards is Tam thank you um happy to be here for the director nice presentation thank you very much I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the uh involvement of the underline and sort of Outreach you've done with those and if they seem unable to these and then the last part would be um um when when the fourth piece would also be if you have resistance from a land will that change the routing um just it's no surprise that we've had some challenges you know that better than I do so I know fla Commissioners also special advice asking me that specific question thank you special Elric um I I'll Attack that the best way I know house so off the bat working with land owners to secure eement we we're currently in negotiations and as you as you saw we shown four different routes we showed a site boundary that was en encompassed quite a bit more property than just what our routes were so we did that to allow for wiggle room as working with land owners if there was a small change or or up where they want us to evaluate another route um move on but we are working with each landowner individually to negotiate not so I'm pretty I understand the Depo but the the Northerly route that looks like a Sol Y and then the souly that parallels I think that's the p y don't know farther west so just west of the PTO Morrow property and West I might take that pointer from you um you're doing a great job so just looking at the routes so starting with a off of CDA we go on this potential route shows on the Stalls um and then it jumps over to River onto Terra into our 730 switchyard we've got route B off of the CDA property that is on PTO Morrow Wendy River and then Terra as well into our switchyard and that entire route is south of railroad in that area we'll go to Route C just to keep it in h alphabetical order we would cross i84 onto Agra Northwest which would then touch Windy River the Port of Morrow and then cross I4 again into our Highway 730 switchyard and then two that would be correct and then route B off of the army Depo is again Port Morrow Windy River Terra and then into our Highway 730 switchyard some that looks like all four alternatives are the same until you reach correct so since we have acquired the across the the CDA property we feel comfortable in showing that but as Dereck mentioned we did Encompass a larger side boundary in case there were changes um where we needed to Route around so we allowed us some legal room to to not force an amendment hopefully later on in process where we could have encompassed it in our site boundary now that's just really helpful so um on a note that I heard so been on our office multiple times coordin any questions perfect thank you in the roomed to comment provide com card being none I will check and see if we have anyone on webinar oh yeah well for those on the webinar in order to in order to raise your hand there's a button on the bottom right of the main window that set of icons if you click on there's an hand icon that would indicate you raising your hand so should you like to comment tonight via the webinar please click that hand icon oh

        "text": " state will need to ensure the market design adequately compensates transmission owners for previous opportunity for increased revenues multiple commenters identified the potential for increased revenues for transmission providers in oregon any increased transmission revenues from rto participation should be socialized across the system as a reduction in rates for transmission customers and then on the flip side of that potential for reduced revenues for an entity like bonneville which earns significant transmission revenue from william power to out-of-state entities a reduction in those revenues could have indirect adverse impact i.e increased transmission costs on its retail customers in state and some concern has been identified about how a reduction in transmission for transmission providers in oregon could adversely impact investments to maintain those systems and thus threaten the long-term health of the regional transmission transmission system and cost shifts transmission benefits must be weighed against the recovery of costs for existing transmission assets and existing transmission contracts there are concerns about potentially unfair and unjust cost shifts among transmission customers and now solutions several potential solutions were identified from other license plate rate prevents cost shifting to customers that were not part of the planning and approval process for an existing transmission asset an rto could utilize such a rate until those assets were fully paid or as a transitional solution to phase in a reallocation of costs zonal or distance sensitive transmission or alternate rto footprints can help mitigate impacts but may introduce reintroduced pancake rates uh congestion revenue rights another alternative solution that could be the development of these kind of rights that provide revenues to holders to offset otherwise increased costs and then the general feedback multiple commenters identified value regardless of the particular solution in some sort of a transitional or phased-in approach so that was a lot of a lot of stuff there uh but i think um on this one perhaps more than any other questions we've talked about so far there's certainly some i think different perspectives here i will open up the floor for feedback and comments uh on these issues related to transmission rates revenues and potential solutions to deal with some of these disparate and again sort of some prompting questions here you know are things you agree with disagree with something that's missing uh something you emphasize more or less than something else adam could you go back a couple of um to the rates the first one um there are no yeah rates rates not revenues there okay there's a relevant question here that i kind of like to get out on the table that's for our region and that's this first one and users in the pacific northwest generally have significantly lower costs or transmission service compared to other areas of whack and a uniform transmission rate could result significant rate increases so the example that comes to mind when i see this is the reference customers of bpa and their ultimate ratepayers so um one of the things that we included i think in our solutions and i i'm not the expert on this but i know there are people on this call that could answer it is i do believe when wapa joined spp or that section portion of wap join spp there was a carve out or something for existing preference customers to not result in a in a significant rate increase for those is anyone able to talk about that and maybe how that might be a mitigating piece to use here in the northwest on bpa's preference customers so this is fred maybe i don't recall all the details but yes there was a kind of a special but yet really to me not so special and the arrangement basically was provide that kind of zonal approach to the pricing and yet i think of it as being part of a broader group of initiatives or approaches that have been done by the different uh rto iso markets around the country to accommodate this in that case it was about how federal hydro you know uh power marketing agency operations would be affected by being in the in the you know expanded in expanded market and also about cost but lots of other examples exist and i think adam you've mentioned some of this some of the commenters have also mentioned you know the possibility of kind of a zonal approach based on geography or you know something that separates out existing transmission versus new projects that separates new projects by voltage level and roughly speaking by the area that they primarily you know there's a lot of those things if you look around the country including in the california iso which you know basically grandfathered existing transmission uh contracts and i think those have just expired or fairly recently you know this will be a long-term and it will involve a lot of negotiation and adjustments to deal with the fairness issue the kind of the the embedded system cost the forward-looking value issue and i always go back to what my friend ron lair says some of you know ron he quite a while ago he was a colorado commissioner and actually chair of the colorado puc and has been very involved in western uh policy since and what he says is don't let the transmission tail wag the overall power grid dog but but what he means by that is not to ignore or you know to under under uh under appreciate the issue of cost and value but rather to keep an eye on the bigger picture in some ways if our transmission costs go up in order to carry a lot more power in the ways that we need it and provide more market value that may not be such a bad thing but that's an investment choice that we should be making it's not just that we should seek lower cost period we should be looking at you know what's the value for what we're getting the delivery value and so that's the way i i kind of look at this so you know call me optimistic on this one or whatever you want optimistic in the sense that i think that there will be compatible agreements that can come out of this solutions but also realistic in that it's going to take a long time to work it out thanks nicole for the question and fred for the the response there i don't know if anyone else has anything to add on i know this is uh transitional transmission agreements um is potential um important topic for for the northwest certainly and lots to learn i suspect from other regions so any of you who have thoughts or comments input from how they've done this in other regions might be worth discussing those here so and this is fred let me add if i could i'm going to if this is appropriate i want to put a link for one of the recommendations i gave to adam on a literature review here a book by steve esser an economist and a kind of power historian who's in texas but he worked for pjm and for other consultancies and he's been a law professor and so on wrote a really interesting book that had a lot in it about transmission uh cost allocation and all the issues that i think very valuable the book came out in 2015 so it's a little dated but still very valuable so if it's okay i'll put that in the link adam this is spencer i'll pipe in on this question and um echo um fred's recommendation of that book i think it's the single best overview of rto formation that's been done as a policy history this set of transmission issues that are raised in the slides here in question five i think are so squarely in the bucket of design details that really i think it needs to be highlighted for legislators as a make or break question depending on what kind of market design we have it may be hard to be as satisfactory and pointing towards good solutions for this compared to some other design issues although i think the ones that you highlighted here are really important to include but i would also add that figuring out tricky questions about cost depending on the nature of your incumbent transmission providers and bonneville is obviously the most important one for our region and is unique in many ways but that discussion among potential participants and members in the rto has happened a bunch of times it had to happen in each of the multi-state rtos so i think we we should keep that in mind that there are solutions that have been worked out elsewhere that we can draw on here as tough as the cost allocation question is for the effects on transmission rates now i appreciate that feedback and uh being able to crystallize sort of the winners and losers potentially and then how other regions have have solved some of these issues and to their being there are paths forward but it's a matter of the details of how we design it any other feedback input on on these big issues here give you another chance as i click back through my slides to get it to the end so hearing no no additional feedback on this one um if there's nothing else i'm i propose we move on to public comment so i'll give another second here if anyone else wants to to pipe up on transmission rates you asked a question when we were talking you asked you've asked it like couple times so far and um i don't know if we wanted to try and answer it but it seemed like it was an important question and that was like what are the problems that we're trying to solve do you feel like you have that information from the respondents or do we need to address that you know it's uh it's something i was i was thinking we could try to address in the second workshop we have a little bit of time here if people have uh if they want to talk about it with with no prompting i'd be happy to yeah um let's throw that question out it sounds like why don't you start us off nicole if you have some thoughts well i was actually thinking maybe it's something to prompt for the next conversation because i think we could just go through a list and list off some of the issues but maybe people want to have a chance for a little bit of thought around that because it sounds like at least uh maybe one or two of the members on the stakeholder advisory committee aren't sure about the problems that we're trying to solve and i'm wondering if some of that came up in this conversation today i don't know yeah that's so um yeah that was my inclination was to uh just for everyone to know you know i want to get some feedback from the advisory committee on if this is the best way to structure our next meeting if there are some things we could do differently um and what you know are there other questions like that that we should get out there um so um if that works for everyone i was thinking we'd frame that question for the for the next meeting adam i i liked what nicole just suggested i i also think that we spent",

        "text": " a lot of resources to go through that process we got to you know do some analysis present in front of council during that time we could just be processing the amendment so is the is the effort extended resulting in an overall efficiency gain we could just provide more flexibility in the rules so that if if an amendment really isn't that complicated we just have one track but the track sort of provides the flexibility to move things quicker if an amendment is more straightforward rather than having tracks um so uh you know we need rules guiding the return of sites to useful nonhazardous condition there isn't really anything in the amendment process uh that directly addresses this issue um um staff has identified a need for some additional rules to cover partial retirement of of a facility there not really anything in there right now so if you if you have an amendment and you basically you know you have let's say I'm just going to make these numbers up you know 500 megawatts of wind turbines and you want to you know decommission 200 of them and then uh you know add some solar uh there's nothing in there about the decommissioning of partial reement facility Jessica you you your hand up yeah can you go back to the prior slide I feel like we may have prematurely move to the next slide yeah yeah so okay no I guess maybe you did hit all the points okay I just wanted to read through it once more thank you yeah no worries and uh I will be making this again the presentation available so if um at least for these slides I'm not for uh I mean any solutions at this point or any sort of deep analysis I do want to make sure that you understand what it is that the you know the issue that's being raised here um so that you can sort of start doing your own thinking about potentially how you feel like you know maybe you feel like this isn't an issue or um you agree that it's an issue and you feel like we should do a or b or c whatever um Okay so staff feels we should clarify what site changes should trigger the amendment process this is a big one so uh well you know and then there because there is it does describe it now but it's sort of hard to implement hard to apply uh so is there is there something we can do to make this more straightforward this is always going to be a tricky thing um there's no we can you know make things really flexible but then they're vague or we can be very prescriptive but then it sort of locks things out in unintentionally in the future it's just always a challenge with rules um about how best to um categorize things it's one of the reasons why the type A type B thing is is a as a pain point because it involves a lot of analysis of like well does it does this meet this threshold does that meet that threshold um when things aren't Crystal Clear like everything over this megawatt is this uh it's just opens the door for confusion um and kind of a sub question for this is what if the proposed amendment is the size of a project that would by itself trigger mandatory FSC review um I you know based on their sort of my thinking to this point there's I think there's good Arguments for saying that should you know why not have that be an amendment it's still we still still part of the same site you know basic location there's still some we should still recognize some efficiencies I recognize that a lot of Works already been done um but then also on the other hand if it's that big like maybe we should sort of provide the additional you know opportunity for public comment maybe we should you know slow things down a smidge um so I'm very I'm sure there's going to be very strong opinions about changing rules around that um but uh yeah so be be thinking about that one for sure um all right so we we probably need some additional rule language to address issues around um the timing and the substance the pre-amendment conference the way it's laid out in the rules right now it sort of maybe doesn't make a you know total sense with when it occurs and what happens at the pre-amendment conference so yes be be thinking about that um see so there's a need to sort of modernize you know the application submission requirements like I said before there's not you know there's frustratingly little flexibility for the regular application process know uh the rules are sort of stuck in time I think but with the amendment process we can sort of recognize that you know it's 2024 and people don't do things the way they did you know when the when the sort of sighting division was created many decades ago so we can reflect that in how things are you know how we require applicants to submit things and um so on and so forth so uh there's there's various rules I have you know just an example here that maybe aren't in the right spot or do we even need that rule so I would definitely um think think about that as you sort of do your own review of the roles um we certainly are um consider sa's considering that we should probably have rules on how project descriptions site certificates get updated based on what is actually built uh and do so without requiring an amendment uh so you know if a developer says well we want to you know build a project that looks like this that has this much stuff uh and they only build half of it and you know 10 years goes by should the side certificate reflect the what was actually done uh versus what was granted um yes David just on that point um it's also the phasing because sometimes you you you don't build them all at once right you you have a facility it gets it gets approved and then so that if that can fit in that I would totally agree it's one of the areas that you know I think does need to be addressed is how we phase projects you know uh to get to the overall site certificate build if you know what I mean because customers always you know take yeah exactly if you're gonna if you're going to go through the f process you might as well grab a biggest size certificate I mean obviously bigger is more analysis area and all that stuff but there's some efficiencies to be had by just grabbing a big scoop and then you know maybe you only build this much but you had this extra in case so but then you know there that that causes issues because like you know maybe there are sort of compliance stuff related to like vegetation or you know if there's nothing built there then you know how do we as the sighting division how do we ensure like do we need to ensure certain types of conditions were complied with because you know it says you had you know you're gonna cut the weeds back this far but like you know it's been 10 years you didn't build anything there so we're gonna you know you agreed to do it but you know it's sort of yeah my my question or just comment was more on when you build not if you don't build after a certain amount of time it's like I I've had several projects in Oregon that you know you get build 100 megawatts now 200 megawatts in three you know two years later Etc right um that's what I'm meaning here is it's not just when you don't have it it's also when you have to bifurcate them you have to you know um you have to to to yeah you have to bif forgate them you have to you you have to make the 500 megawatt to one 200 megawatt one 300 megawatt project as an example and still all 500 megawatts gets built that's my my thing is is how do you do that when you haven't had any significant changes in in the project the only difference is is one part got built one year and a couple years later the other part got built so that I'm just saying it's a subcategory of what you were referring to there yeah absolutely we we wouldn't want to create rules that basically said oh if you don't build it within six months or something like that you're then the the side certificate automatically shrinks to whatever you built you know because obviously yeah these these things get deployed um it's interesting just as a side note you know like nuclear plants and you know even natur even like natural gas plants can take very long take multiple years these solar projects can you know you can throw them up in a in a matter of months depending on the the scale um but yeah but but unlike sort of maybe natural gas you know you they're much more partial to to sort of stage deployment um as you said so like you know phase one phase two um and uh yeah so it's it's an interesting question from a rules perspective you know how do we create rules that sort of reflect that reality um and you know and you know optimize for sort of all you know probable or likely you know outcomes of things can be up built all at once or things can be built in a phase but that we still want the C get to sort of ref you know reality and and just makes things easier from an administrative standpoint uh yes Andy you have a you have your hand raised yeah sorry I was I was late to the to this I'm Andy bow with Northwest Natural along those lines it would be beneficial to you to have a mechanism in in that situation where the site certificate holder could come back to you without having you go into an amendment and say we got an amendment that had you know three separate as aspects that we were going to build and we only ended up building one or two of those and being able to reconcile those differences in the site certificate without going through an amendment process or working with you guys to do that so that we're not being held for compliance issues on things we haven't developed do that make sense yeah I mean that's I don't I don't have I don't have the answers right this second but that's definitely something that I uh that we're thinking about and to the extent you care about this issue you should think about as well um so yeah I I agree that's that's something that we're looking at um so yeah that's that's going to be some of these are definitely a lot more complicated than others um that's one that's definitely one of the more uh complex issues I think at this point I do think there's a a way forward but it's not necessarily um we're not going to",

I'm essentially the lead staff to them so that's why I'm the Council secretary okay okay thank you for making that clear um I have a few comments and I'd like to know if this is built where's the energy going is it going to stay in Linn County but it would stay within the valley it would stay within uh Willamette Valley powering well approximately 34 000 homes wherever uh the generation is needed well and I would like to see this if you got to build it I would like to see it built closer to Portland OR Eugene I mean that I'm they would love y'all I'm sure okay um and uh the impact on Wildlife that was my question and um where will the trash go I mean are these solar cells for the 40 years is that their life so we say Project Life Is 40 years right 40 years is a meme that one thing that's 40 just gone so part of the decommissioning process is the Assurance of uh proper recycling of the panels and all the infrastructure they can be recycled they can be recycled okay yeah I know I've I want minerals are going to be mined for these solar that's something that I personally don't know okay but that's something we could definitely dig into and that's our module manufacturer okay so you don't know where the minerals are going to come from or we mine silica for the panels in the state of Washington not not too sure okay yeah sorry that's that's okay not my division okay well if you do and and most uh electric cars are use a lot of cobalt and um I guess everybody probably knows that it's mined in the Democrat Republic of Congo and um this is mined by little five-year-old children and slaves so um yeah I think that's terrible and I know Patrick steady really supports the electric cars but that is where it costs more energy to make those electric cars you know that it does the gas and yeah yeah and I think um this probably will take more energy to produce these cells than it's going to put out um I I and also I'd like to know um subsidized is this being subsidized by the federal government or the state okay we fund this project ourselves okay um there are things like tax credits but outside of that they're not receiving anything well tax credits are our subsidies tax credits are all the people in this room yeah that's that's taxes are from us um and also why haven't you come I mean I just learned about this about a week and a half ago why haven't you come since this is so close to Brownsville why haven't you come to the city council meeting with this and talk to us about it I mean we were all kind of blindsided by this just like everybody else was so we've actually been for the last couple of months if not since November of last year uh going to various stakeholders throughout Linn County and surrounding cities including the city of Brownsville to give them a one-pager about our project let them know that so yeah the one page yes so we've been doing our Outreach trying to get meetings with all the local cities because on top of this process through fsec we are trying to actually host our own town hall meetings in various cities to get more public opinion okay um so to answer your question we have been here you gave a one page to our city administrator is that what you did uh or I'll ask my staff on that but we did stop by to try to see whom would be the best person to talk to so we can set up a meeting in person okay um that is what we've been doing with some other cities around here as well okay I haven't heard anything about it other than what was uh okay so when you talked about a bond is that going to go specifically in a fund for this project or is this something mistaken get their hands on because I've I've known bonds before that ended up not being there when the 40 years are up because everybody forgets that they're there no this is a legal requirement it is specific to the facility so it doesn't go anywhere other than in my office and it will stay there as it gets sort of replaced by new bonds there is no ability by any other entity within the state to utilize this for anything else okay okay thank you I think that's pretty much all oh why are you not going through the county who is who is I've seen you before I just don't know where maybe yeah the the uh the process the reason why it's not going through the county is just based on the acreage of high value Pharma so it's based on a standard so I know um there's uh there's a choice as to whether or not the council can go through you know the um the County's land use review right but because the city the facility itself uh exceeds this high value standard it puts it in the jurisdiction of f Sex review so that's why the the application the permit itself is going through f-sec does that help yes but I I I think you have a better chance not going through County the the Commissioners I think you stand a lot better chance and I think that's why you've chosen to go this way I can respond so that was my mistake I thought you were asking about the land use question but um so we have us we have in Oregon revised Statute uh we have a definition of an energy facility and whether it's wind or solar or pipelines or other things certain things over you know a specific threshold automatically go to the energy facility citing Council okay this project because it is on high value farmland and exceeds 160 Acres it is within the jurisdiction of the energy facility citing Council there is no opportunity to go anywhere else now within our process the land use is an option by the applicant they could request to go through the conditional use permit process with the county or have that Consolidated into our process that is their only choice of election there but but the application as a whole R exceeds anything they would have to be at 150 acres to go to County jurisdiction and it's a lot bigger than that so they chose to go through yeah so the energy facility sighting Council um is the actual okay so that's it's it's which is state jurisdictional so the project is big enough it is our our jurisdiction no matter what I'd like to also know how many people local people are are going to be employed by so during the construction of this project for 18 months it could range anywhere from 100 to 300 persons um union jobs the average is about 100 persons for per day jobs that is uh it would be subject to uh requirements from tax credits and stuff like that so I'm not too familiar with the exact okay yeah definition or what their exact requirements are but if it does require union jobs then we would have to use union labor right um and then when the Project's fully built uh it would be employing about one to three persons for the operation not um anything having to do with the like panel washing or anything of that sort okay okay and um are there no American companies that are doing this there are a lot of companies that produce energy that produce projects so we have companies from the United States from this region from Europe from Canada from Asia they come from all over so this organization is kind of like a conglomerate of a lot of different countries is that right or is it just South Korea the pairing company itself is just South Korea okay uh they do have companies elsewhere in the united in the world for various um and just maybe this doesn't answer your question but hopefully it adds some um one of the things I touched on when I presented is that we're vertically um and our panels are actually made in the United States there are not many manufacturers who have factories in the United States there is probably less than 10 in the United States to actually build their panels here um and so yes we are a South Korean um well at least our parent company is but they're heavily invested into the United States okay and I have been to South Korea I love South Korea I have nothing against South Korea um it's just that I would like to see Americans working and um I don't support this at all it's going to be",

        "text": " like the breakdown between like materials labor and you mentioned like sort of reconnection and all these other process i'm just kind of curious um what that percentage breakdown uh like a top level boy it's extremely difficult giving the hot the high variability in in different projects from a 20 kilowatt in conduit hydropower project to a multi-megawatt scale um obviously with inflation right now we're seeing massive increases in in contingency fees in the in the capital stack of a project um unpredictability doesn't lead to attractive projects certainly from the perspective the project owner i wish i could give you specific breakdowns of capex of materials would be this amount this percentage and interconnection will be this percentage but i can't it's highly variable that's that's understandable that i appreciate that response and i think this is probably just a general question i'll have like i think as as you noted like as the cost for materials or technology um goes downward you know just kind of curious what that means for the overall cost of a construction of a project and as as we understand like wages are probably going up due to labor shortages or just needing to attract um uh workers i'm just always curious whether like is it you know twenty percent thirty percent you know and i know there's times the scale as these projects get larger but those are just kind of general questions i will have uh in the back of my head as we go through um the different presentations but appreciate appreciate your response thanks randy so you can keep asking you'd like hopefully our presenters heard and we'll try to weave that stuff in too any other questions from anybody um it looks like we have a comment maybe a question um just a note from angela that material costs are going up right now even though the trend was that they were going down for quite some time because of the cost of steel has doubled and supply chain issues are driving driving costs up in general yeah so that yeah we're seeing that in solar we're seeing that in hydropower biopower it's it's across the board right now uh fairly unprecedented inflation and and so we're seeing the contingencies from project developers being much broader 25 30 contingency just because the unpredictable nature of of materials and labor costs yeah something um stephanie that i'm thinking and i'm not really sure how to weave it in because i'm like have this temptation to ask the group right now which i know that would be a bad idea but i think we should probably consider um how much we want to balance writing the report from the perspective of like how the economy was like a couple of months ago versus how it is now like how we're gonna tell that story because it has changed dramatically very quickly as my understanding i know the costs were going up but now we have the general economic slowdown that's starting to happen so um we'll need to i mean luckily we have an economist but kind of balancing the like overall trends and then kind of the the sudden change um will be something to think about so as we're going through the day today and asking questions and having conversation i hope folks will think about maybe how to grapple with all right stephanie you want to bring up our next all right so next we have ormond hildebrand from the patu wind farm and so is he on i thought i saw it sorry one thing really quick dave there's a question in the chat if you wouldn't mind taking a second to answer it that'd be awesome and then we could move on to just find the chat here you'll be controlling the slides stephanie will have the slides and then i'll come on after the 10 minute mark to give you like a little like hey it's been 10 minutes perfect uh my name is grant hart i am a legal extern for sbua we're a small business utility advocate and i just had a quick question for dave small commercial or business projects currently that you may or may not know of um has there been much discussion about like for example like rooftop solar being put on shopping malls or you know on uh downtown businesses have you seen very much of that i might punt that to angela almost exclusively exclusively with municipalities irrigation districts local governments as far as commercial projects on shopping malls um i suspect there are some in our portfolio and the commercial side of the side of our residential sector i was wondering if angela could comment on that if she knows of any yeah i can jump in there's definitely commercial projects happening all over the state i just learned about one today wood village area of portland on a meat processing facility yeah lots of commercial projects all uh that's that's great to know thank you very much all right so now let's hand it over to great thanks stephanie can we go to the first slide please sure my name is uh ormond hildebrand i'm the original founder developer of potu wind um in north central oregon sherman county about three miles outside of the the town of the megalopolis of um we're in the klondike area next time please i was asked really to give a little bit of overview of patu and you know some of the community wind renewable energy benefits to the to pods too i want to talk a little bit about when i talk about community i really refer to you know the local investor you know people who are local in the community who invest and build these types of projects as opposed to let's say an absentee landowner or absentee owners of a utility who are you know outside shareholders who may be involved in the next slide why i feel community renewables are important to oregon it's our local resource you know we we we have it we've lived with it we know it we ought to be able to develop it we can use it to improve our community um i think you know the national renewable energy labs oregon state university of minnesota have all done studies on community renewable energy as compared to absentee renewable energy projects and you know and they they can show in their studies their uh econometric studies even a 3.5 to five times more return to local economy as compared to absentee renewable energy projects as the university of minnesota study simply states the money stays in the community and i can attest to the fact you know the money that i make stays in the community i buy local i buy my vehicles from the dodge dealer of the dalles you know we're we're we're a local a local uh firm and we can provide long-term base to technicians and people in the area next slide please or synergistic with the larger scale renewable energy and let me be right up front here i could not have built a two wind without the massive development of the larger utility scale projects from pedrola avengrid from portland general electric bigelow canyon they provided that massive you know availability of technicians and trains through the area that allowed me to get the job so you know i look at i i don't look at this as an either or this is um you know i i think that you know we're we're vital to each each other within the community renewable projects local investors you know improve community acceptance with this community when you have local investors involved local people who have been part of the community for not just for years but for it really helps smooth the acceptance into the community i see definite upside these types of local investor community projects solar and storage are just into this area we need to be able to maximize the existing generation you know my project pachulin is a nine megawatt facility i have the infrastructure the low ground distribution facility to transmission to the substation the substations built up for 10 megawatts the long-term transmission with beep the platinum power is 10 i need to be able to maximize the use of this facility so you know i could probably easily uh the generation by at least twice with going to a solar and storage facility uh down down the road here and that's some of the plans that i have next slide so part 2 is just one example here's a picture of the the site itself next slide please a little bit of the background um my family was involved in farming out there since the 1860s some of my great grandfather and the original tractor out there in the area we had some of the original women rights um being sold to uh eve madrola and and avon grid but in 2005 evergreen decided not to develop part of the leased area so i decided much like an infield project for a housing development in in the portland area i decided to take the small amount of land that avograd really didn't want to have and decided to take the lease back and develop it myself with wind at that point in time solar were really not an option um the solar rates really weren't hadn't the solar cost of voltaic panels really hadn't come down at that point so it made more sense to go with wind next next panel please you know i have some definite reasons to move forward in 2005. one i knew the wind resources we've been tracking resources for a long time out there i have some of these very initial existing studies that helped develop development out there in the area i had as i mentioned before i had the large existing developments that are already present with the you know the massive trains in and manpower plus at that time too we had the oregon business energy tax credits although i look back on this right now i thought you know they were important but they weren't the defining critical piece of going forward here um the oregon puc early on recognized i think in 2005 2007 that small qfs and avoided cost rulings were important to the area sherman county did some of the original work on on on making sure those avoided cost terror afraid scott got set and really when it comes down to it you know my cost of generation are really immaterial to the purple avoided cost rates when my my rates were set they were based on basically what it would cost a investor owned utility go out and buy power on the market from an existing thermal fire gas facility that's what my rates were you know in in a very simplistic form that's what they were set at so it's up to me to make a profit with those rates um it's not up for the ratepayer to if i can't if i can't maintain",

        "text": "3 billion EPA anticipating to award in implementation um there will be only 32 to 115 awarded nationally for this competition that's a very small amount of awards for this amount of dollars so with that in mind we're focusing all of the measures that are included in this draft um to also be those that meet that criteria and keep our state competitive for those funds so this slide represents EPA scoring criteria for applications and it's very much guiding our decisions as to what we prioritize in that plan uh that includes maximizing cost per ghd reduction having a positive impact to our lowincome and disadvantaged communities having quantifi quantifiable and scalable measures um and it also is we that measurable outcomes on that 3 to fiveyear Horizon is really important to the EPA and so that's very much driving the measures that we're ining uh so that means that the measures and the programs that are associated with them must have existing capacity and Readiness our team is continuing to assess even since the draft came out uh and refine that draft to ensure that measures included meet the needs for both the peap and that Grant application which really means that the graft that you all have seen is evolving and likely to actually be even um more narrow in Focus uh so that we make sure that we can Implement These funds in a timely fashion and again stay competitive on the greenhouse gas slide organ is fortunate enough as I mentioned already to have um inventories both a consumption based and a sector-based inventory that allows us to approach all of this work um across the whole system and we're really looking forward to adding to those inventories through the commission's work for the Oregon's natural working lands carbon seat frustration inventory um which is part of our seat Camp uh and that'll create an even more comprehensive picture for Oregon to understand um how to address greenhouse gases the approach that we used uh to develop this peap includes all of those inventories the road map um and of course the associated transformational integrated greenhouse gas gas emissions reduction project report or as we call it the tiet informed by all of this as well as that work with other state agencies and tribes and local jurisdictions um what we have found are the areas the sectors that are um that will lead to the most benefit and are most ready um are Transportation commercial and residential buildings waste and materials management so we addressed these already um but we're going to go into a little bit more detail on the measures uh that support all of this within the draft slide so up first is transportation not only is transportation the largest contributing sector in Oregon to greenhouse gases it is also the one that touches almost everyone's lives whether taking a bus driving a car getting packages transportation is involved I had a delivery this morning um that was delayed actually from our ice storm so um I know what that's like um by including transportation in this pcap and applying for funds to address greenhouse gas reductions as well as um it it will address those major greenhouse gas reductions just to be clear like this um funding this is our largest computor so by including these measures we're really going to more quickly address the greenhouse gases coming from transportation and in addition to addressing transportation we get other air quality as well as environmental justice benefits Oregon are already has an EV rebate program for cars however there are more people who want a rebate than there are funds to provide rebates to the point that the program can only run for part of the Year this measure in the pcap is uh to expand those rebates for Ev cars and it's focused on supporting lowincome and moderate income households and it also is for both new and used e cars another measure addresses medium and heavy duty Vehicles examples of these Vehicles include school buses transit buses garbage trucks and trucks Oregon has an existing grant program is creating a rebate program for medium heavy duty Vehicles the current program has millions of dollars of applications every year that do not get awarded due to available funds this measure would expand funding to support purchasing medium heavy duty electric vehicles which also reduces diesel exhaust these programs will prioritize vehicles that drive in areas with vulnerable populations such as where there are children minority populations and lower income areas the potential recipients include fets school districts local governments tribes and companies we're also including measure to support infrastructure for electric vehicles so that new electric vehicles are able to charge because it's great to have the vehicles on the road but we also need to be able to support so that they can charge side pleas housing is a major concern in Oregon and these measures are in support of the creation of sustainable energy efficient buildings as well as efficiency gains for existing buildings again there are existing programs to support the delivery of these measures they have some funding but those funds meet a small portion of the need if we received funding this measure would increase the Energy Efficiency of housing create more sustainable and lower carbon footprint buildings in addition these measures can support Oregon residents by offering heat pumps and weatherization Not only would there be greenhouse gas reductions but there would also increase Community resiliency especially for extreme events these measures include incentives to build more energy in houses or incentives to the reach code incentives for heat pumps and new and existing houses as I mentioned and weatherization as the same and incentives to early adoption for buildings of the building performance standards resulting in additional near chart nearer chart greenhouse gas reductions next slide addressing waste is not something a lot of people think about but it is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases in Oregon it also needs a holistic approach meaning one that addresses greenhouse gases from Upstream to Downstream so from food waste to the greenhouse gases that result in the waste in land cill our measures aim to address food waste through the recovery efforts that prevent food waste from going to landfills and utilizing techniques such as composting and anerobic gestion landfills remain one of the largest sources of methane emissions in our state methane has a high global warming potential 28 times more than carbon dioxide so we are also including a measure that allows for site specific reductions while we discussed buildings on the last slide using materials that have low embodied carbon can make those new or renovated buildings have an even lower carbon footprint so that's also included within our materials measures that was a lot of information and a lot of measures to go through quite quickly I would just want to say that all of the measures that um I just walked you through were selected to address the areas where greenhouse gases reductions are needed the most for our state but they are also selected because they're scalable they can deliver reductions in that short period of time and they can benefit rural communities throughout our state slide SE just as a reminder in addition to the state agency and local jurisdictions we've also engaged with interested tribes in Oregon uh to identify actions to include in the state's pcap so that they can point to the state's pcap to apply for implementation funds um as they are also eligible applicants under this program not all tribes are developing a peap however the affilated tribes of Northwest Indians atni is also developing a plan that tribes within the region can point to in addition to the peap engagement with indry tribes in Oregon has guided actions for inclusion and tribal priorities which you see reflected in the draft and we continue to engage with those tribes to make sure that they are represented within our slide please a requirement for the peap is the analysis of lowincome and disadvantaged communities that be impacted by the measures as defined by EPA for the purposes of the cprg low income and Advantage communities are any community that is identified as disadvantaged by climate and economic Justice screening tool or CEST this tool uses dat sets indicate data sets indicators of burden in eight categories climate change energy Health housing Legacy pollution Transportation Water and Wastewater and Workforce Development it's quite comprehensive over 20% Oregon census tracks so 233 out of 8 834 are considered disadvantaged the map on this slide shows these communities and their location throughout Oregon while it only represents 28% of tracks you can see that by land mass um it actually represents a good portion of our state which is something we really all need to be thinking about most of the measures included in the draft peap are considered Statewide but depending on the measure they may impact some communities more than others such as medium and heavy duty reductions or move to electric vehicles might impact urban areas while heat pumps might be able to impact rural communities more slide please I just wanted to point out for everyone um who isn't already familiar but our draft bir climate action plan is available on our cprg website the um web address is at the bottom and it's about halfway down the page um and in addition um if you can change the slide on that same page we we link to our feedback survey one back please oh okay um do um I think that there's a slide in between those two yep there we go um it's like ketchup it's like um due to our very short timeline we're accepting feedback through a survey so we can move more quickly and evaluate incorporate that feedback their survey is on the DEQ site but it's also available at the link we're providing on this screen and I'll put it in the chat as well and then you can also use the Q QR code to take you there so for the English based um survey English language based survey um those that feedback is actually due today and we would love your feedback all of your feedback it's really the important not just for our peap but also framing our comprehensive climate plan and all of our climate programs um for the um Spanish language survey that is actually due February 7th we wanted to give more time because that got up a little bit later due to simple procurement when our end so uh please provide our feedback we we're excited to get it we've already received over 70 um pieces of um feedback so feedback related to the draft must be submitted the survey just to emphasize that and that's because we have to move so very quickly on our timeline the feedback is anonymous and it will be used to inform our our final peap as well as that comprehensive climate plan like I mentioned so current oh please so while the feedback window hasn't quite closed um I did I did go in and um have collected an an example of what is being um provided to us so like I said we already have over 70 comments um a lot of that is coming from the more densely populated counties um and then we have",

we're going to go live on 81 with uh our new payroll system and then the following Monday is when the software the upgraded software system will be installed so the financial system will be down for that whole week as they're installing that program um we're going to be busy in the month of July um really testing the program one of the major aspects of testing was payroll the system and the feel and look is changing quite a bit because we're on a 2016 2017 software uh version and you know we're upgrading to the newer version but there's a lot of great qualities out of the new system a lot of reports we're going to be able to generate and build in there they can be sent automatically to departments that need this information to make decisions so we're excited about that a a few other policies I'm going to be working with um senior leadership on I'd like to update the procurement card policy along with the travel policy so those are some of the busy busy items and then also there's a bing budget that we got to prep for for next spring so those are going to kind of be the things that we're going to be focusing on when it comes to my budget you'll notice Personnel costs uh you know they went up about 10% but like I said um it's really to do with the the new Step system but then also a little bit more of my time is being transferred into Finance whereas before it was a little bit more the urra um so it's kind of that one that one es and flows and and the materials and services increased we do have our audit costs in there and all the fees that we have to pay for whether it's Actuarial valuations for our post employment retirement plans arbit Arbitrage calculations and so forth so that's really a lot of our budget materials and services made up of those Professional Services that we have to use if we want to try to get a clean opinion on our financial statements so with that I'll open up for any questions that you may have I think this is probably City Charter but credit card usage policy is also for employees or Council which for Council that's the charter yeah okay all thanks David yeah all right so I'm going to present from oh do you have a question City thaty just a minor change I will be presenting for Municipal Court um some of the goals uh they're going to complete she uh the the full dismissal as we've already spoke about about just kind of that little snafu we had on the the Northbound Lanes only uh Highway 99 and Roy Rogers twon Sherwood Road uh transfer um everything from web LEDs to to Leeds 2020 um in the the law enforcement data system and they're really looking at adding some more uh Pro 10 judges uh just so there's availability of you know uh Mr Morris is out or or whatnot so we're really going to review that and make sure we have folks on standby I had a question yes what is the completed second remission order of Governor KC's office regarding outstanding traffic fines what was that it's under this year's highlights for municipal court I think that was probably supposed to be Governor Brown um Governor Brown basically did away with thousands of traffic citations at the end of her term that's right that were suspended to give people a second chance so that went out to just about every Municipal Court that was a state mandate that's correct yep unfunded mandate can I say a quick question on the the number of traffic violations does that include the cameras yes that that is mostly the the cameras and you're looking at the the 21 000 figure yeah yeah that was projected we like we said not a little off uh there's a significant activity folks got used to that system being down over there and in that two-month period we had to dismiss over 6,000 tickets well yeah it puts that into perspective how much compared to how much you get 6,000 was a chunk yeah normal year I mean if you really look at the data the vast majority of the tickets are Northbound on 99 in sunet so it's it's I think we the last time we looked at it was only like 10% yeah Assurance income residents of assurance income right which is huge and for for their for their budget he kept standing up like it was his turn and then he sat down so uh total Department Revenue uh you'll notice in the 24 budget we had uh 1.9 million budgeted if it wasn't for that little snafu we would have exceeded that um but we're we are projecting we're still going to come in about $1.6 million so um so I I did a small increase because I anticip hate the Traffic Systems fully coming online next year but I was being really conservative uh just a 3% change like I talked about in the forecast and really and when it comes to Personnel Services uh budgeting a little more overtime uh they they did have a little more overtime they're currently working right now just to get those tickets dismissed um but really as we talked about it has to do with the the new Step system materials and services you'll see have increased to 23% but as those um the systems come online now we got to start paying for them because right now uh with red Flex when system sections of the system are offline they give it give us a full discount on paying for that part of the system so as they're coming online things are going to get a little yeah oh I was thinking you talking about over there but yeah just at the two yeah I just want to add though we're not doing this yet but in the last uh short session in Salem they did U expand City's abilities to have like mobile um red light cameras and stuff like that so we'll probably be looking at that in terms of dealing with like uh school zones issues and stuff like that there you go you'll make a million I promise L I don't think so I we're talking about these red light cameras in terms of fin finances and I just want to add um at least from my point of view the main reason we did those cameras was changing behavior um especially you know with the new high school right there on 99 West it allows our officers to not have to patrol that so they can do more proactive policing and engage in other my opinion more important activities within our city so it's it's a it's not it's not a money maker it's it's about making really good utilization of our police officers it does but there's Al also a lot of costs associated with running that program it's not all revenue it's also a deterrent once you get a ticket so it does help change Behavior there's a lot of Moma County people that need to learn and we we're helping them learn we're helping educate Moma County residents how about Yam Hill County some of them too mostly Zip is that what the number is for Sherwood 10% again it's important for anyone listening the Sherwood zip code is very large and there as much more people living in the Sherwood zip code that do not live in the city than live in the city and and I'll say I said this to the committee last year I don't remember a single time at least that my office has prosecuted somebody in Sherwood and we only prosecute the folks that get lawyers but generally the folks that get lawyers are truck drivers CDs holders uh folks of that nature so it's it's if we have I don't know about it so it's it's rare that somebody from Sherwood is is prosecuted at least from office my mother certainly has gotten her ticket and she lives in town full disclosure beh and she's changed her behavior she did the whole you know sign up for the class thing which is a wonderful thing so if you do happen to have a good driving record but you error there are steps you can take U and not incur the expense or the fully expense yep you could come talk to my court staff upstairs or call them and with that I'm going to turn it over to Eric the community development director good evening budget committee Eric Gage community development director with the city uh first uh budget item is CD management this is uh mainly salaries myself and our codee compliance officer no changes in in Personnel materials and service mainly are uh in4 what we use to process building permits of the technology software comes out of the CD budget so no major highlights there um planning department um development anyone looking to get development approval on the city first off is the planning department so we're processing the land use applications for um indust the industrial growth in the tonen employment area any the commercial growth um also any subdivisions our planning department is processing uh highlights for the next year uh Sherwood West is a really big project we just finished the application to Metro if they approve our Urban growth boundary expansion we'll be looking at comprehensive planning Master planning um other plans for Sherwood West um so that'd be a highlight for next year really focused I me go back one uh really focused in still on the tonen employment area we have a study going on right now for the interior of the tonen employment area it's going to be a little bit harder to develop that area and so we're focused on uh doing some Road alignment studies and utility studies to try and get that development going as quickly as possible um and then just encouraging Housing Development to reduce housing costs and and provide more variety of housing um we are expecting to be busier than last year we do have an increase in the in the revenue about 40% um for planning that's just land use fees not a huge number overall building department brings in more Revenue but um this just demonstrates the the higher Revenue uh through land use permits that we're expecting um happy to say we can do that without additional Staffing we're not proposing any additional planning staff this year uh we have a really uh great associate planner who's been here about a year and can process those land use applications um in terms of material on service looks like we're down a little bit from last year but I think the main main item in there is is a large um consulting fee that if we do get the urban growth boundary expansion approved we're looking at a study for elwart road to figure out the",

        "text": " just want to let all of our board members know that it's uh myself as chair and director Davidson and Navaro and I'm I'm sure that any of the three of us but I especially am happy to answer questions and I will be providing updates at our board meetings um on what's going on and um I really appreciated the robust discussion earlier this evening uh particularly around um Transit safety and and Community safety and I think that's something that I'm I'm very appreciative that this group takes so seriously and um I want you to know that we will be paying attention to that so I appreciate you raising the concerns that you did um um we did have a meeting of the scats policy committee earlier this week on Tuesday um January each year is when we have election of officers and I'm happy to report that Kathy Clark is remaining our chair and I am our vice chair um so that is exciting um I do love me a policy committee uh we did talk about a bunch of projects I mentioned one earlier which is a signal uh signal updates in South Salem um they're going to update these boxes that talk to The Pedestrian signals and the traffic lights um it will enable Transit sign signal priority along the commercial Corridor at some point if we are able to extend that project to that space um and these new updates um I wish uh director Duncan were there I think she'd be happy to hear this though she heard at scats um but uh they're particularly useful for pedestrian safety um and they can make a lot of enhancements in that direction um we're also in the process of updating our unified planning work program which is something we do every year um we have kind of one more chance to revise it um and submit comments through the weekend um I have made a few of additional comments that I'm going to submit to scats or excuse me Cog staff or scat staff um they then submit it to ODOT and the Federal Highway Administration um for approval um I talked a little bit earlier too about the the federal obligations that are received um and I do what just want to give a shout out to um kind of our jurisdictional partners as well as Transit um one thing that we learned at the policy committee is um when Federal money comes in if you're not spending it in a timely fashion kind of goes back into a big bucket and then if you are like a qualifying entity which we happen to be you get that large s you get that like money that went back in the bucket because other people weren't able to spend it because they weren't very organized you get these redistribution funds and we have been fortunate enough um to qualify for these redistribution funds and I think it's something to do with our spending it in a timely fashion and odot's work um but we we do receive quite a bit of additional Federal funding in that regard so um it's really a um a commend of like the the work that is done at a local level to get these Transportation projects in place so um for everybody that's involved in that I think we owe our thanks um and yeah I think at the next meeting which is in um we've had this on the agenda before um hopefully this is the last time um that we will be discussing with our our partners in the mo the the voting structure for the policy committee um moving forward we've had a difficult time getting the right people in attendance um and there are some people whose attendance is deemed critical um but we're hopeful that the Stars will align in February and that we will be able to come back to the board um with an update in that regard and I did also want to say that in that in those federal funds um Transit um has received in that 2003 to 2027 and I think it's probably a smaller amount of time from that I would have to look at the spreadsheet but um 22.3 million in federal funds which doesn't quite line up with cfm's number I noticed but it's what's in my notes from this scat meeting um and we also um are recipients of the largest Federal fund Grant allocation on the entire sheet which is $7.9 million for battery electric buses so good job Transit um and that's it that concludes my report thank you thank you very much Davidson keeping me on my toes I appreciate that um so got a few uh reports to make so immediately prior to our last board meeting the service enhancement committee met it was our first meeting I serve on the committee along with director H sh director Nado and uh it was a kickoff meeting so we didn't make any decisions uh but it's a very important kickoff meeting um this was an opportunity for us to talk about at a very high level what we wanted to get done some of the obstacles that we foresaw and uh most importantly what the plan of attack was and so I'd like to just take a moment to identify the different Focus areas and staff leads uh for each of these Focus areas so uh our general manager Alan Pollock will be the overall project manager for this he'll also be providing legal legislative and policy um he'll be in charge of those areas uh our chief Planning and Development officer aom will be providing service enhancement plan he'll be in charge of that our chief communication officer feni will be in charge of as you might imagine the communication plan uh Chief Financial Officer Laro will focus on the revenue and the financial plan and then uh Chief human resource officer Rose is in charge of the Staffing plan because with all of this plan service enhancement of course there are U this touches all parts of the organization and so I I do want to acknowledge how much work this will be this is incredibly exciting work especially as me as a board member who doesn't have to do this work but I want to acknowledge that this is a lot of work um and we will have our next meeting uh next month and so we'll have more to report on then but this will be a ongoing process that will take some time um last month uh myself and president youo host pressy we had an opportunity to meet with congresswoman Selenas and I just want to publicly ackowledge that her support at the Congressional level is uh I was going to say invaluable but I I think I can actually put a dollar amount to it but the five battery electric buses that are coming um as our CFM Advocates noted wasn't in no small part because of her advocacy which as a freshman legislator is uh remarkable and so um seeing those roll out in into service in likely 2025 will be phenomenal um I also had an opportunity to attend the Chariots holiday lunch in always a a a great opportunity to sit down with Chariot staff talk um um I also love seeing these giant TV screens being repurposed to Holiday cozy Vibes um just um so over at the Council of governments we uh had a meeting at the end of December and I was honored to be elected as the incoming chair of the Council of governments thank you um I will I guess formally assume the role as chair at the Council of government's annual dinner and as the name implies this is a annual opportunity for the Council of governments to meet do a annual review and also to just gather together to meet talk about our shared priorities and so this year it will be on February 28th at 6 PM uh the confederated tribes of the grand Ron is hosting us at Spirit Mountain so if you're able to attend I would invite you to attend uh Clerk of the board kir pressy has sent over an email with details on how to attend um she can help you with that and so love to have you there um speaking of COG the Council of governments um they have a few shared legislative priorities that we do as well uh the West so the regional rail bill um as of I think 5 days ago there are 22 legislative co-sponsors to that bill so um momentum is growing which is exciting it is a there's bipartisan support as well as bamal support um it is a short session and it is the legislature it is a rather Mercurial Beast so um I think continued advocacy will be important the support is pretty broad um M Municipal governments up and down the corridor are in support of that as is the railroad um which is significant that's a new addition this year and then uh you know organizations like thousand friends of Oregon aorta they're in support so um not counting the chickens before they hatch but I'm optimistic that we can can uh get this ped um to the conversation earlier about the role of Transit as we think about tolling certainly in the metro area it's critically important that we have robust rapid and reliable Transit that spans different uh commuting water sheds or commute sheds excuse me um and a train that runs every hour up and down the valley uh 19 or 20 hours a day would really do that um but first step first we got to get funding for a study so um the other thing that is a goal of ours that we share in our legislative agenda is property tax reform the Cog uh will be in probably next month uh starting to do some information or some op some learning on property tax reform inviting different speakers to attend the legislative committee so if you are interested you're welcome to attend we meet every other Wednesday at 7: a.m. uh it's a jolly and chipper time if you're able to attend um and then I I did want to speak to what director Carney mentioned about on on South Commercial uh with the upgrades the its upgrades um with the the signals I I think that there in is in particular an opportunity to maybe do a q jump at madona in commercial uh with the signal upgrade the city's already planning on doing that uh I think there's the infrastructure there there's a turn lane I think there's an opportunity there um but most interestingly I think that there will be support from one and potentially two neighborhood associations in that area to support that and so to the extent that we can tap into uh that support that's growing there for this these kinds of interventions I would be supportive of that um there are also as the city makes investments in South Commercial but other parts of the city um I I think it's a good opportunity for us to reconsider where our bus stops are so in that similar neck of the wood we might want to shift a little",

        "text": " the screen we are not proposing any changes to our current Staffing level we have been fortunate over this past year in that our 34 FTE positions have largely been fully filled especially over the second half of this current fiscal year going to your comment earlier that has been a big morale boost for my team because when all the seats are filled it's amazing you can actually get through your workload much much easier so we have one vacant position currently that we're hoping to fill in our Inspection Team Diane alluded to this we had a new construction supervisor that we lured out here from the Kansas City area he only spent six months he's great great the city of North Plains snagged him as their next Public Works director which is a great opportunity you need to do something about that well so but overall as you can see in the slide we are proposing a very moderate seven percent increase in our department budget uh compared from the current year next slide there are three programs within RUSD our Administration program program includes our two division managers Damon reishi and Andy Braun both Damon and Andy are seasoned knowledgeable leaders who have been with our district for nearly two decades and I'm fortunate to have them lead their respective programs within the department Damon leads our development services program which includes 27 FTE this division provides a number of services I won't go through all of them but I'll touch on a few including Regional services to the entire service area including various environmental reviews and Regional support of plan review and construction inspection across our co-implementer partner cities for consistency with design and construction standards to local program Services related to permitting of private development within the unincorporated area and the cities of banks Durham Gaston King City and North Plains and finally administration of the private stormwater quality facility inspection program Andy Braun leads our systems planning program which includes five FTE this program leads the regional integration of capital planning and Analysis across our service area coordinates inter-agency Capital Improvement design and construction and helps integrate developer constructed infrastructure to assure capacity for growth in both the sanitary and storm water systems next slide please one of the critical projects that RUSD has been leading since late 2021 is the development of new intergovernmental agreements or igas with our two largest city Partners Hillsboro and Beaverton both of these cities requested new agreements be negotiated back in June 2021 which also coincides with my arrival to clean water services as the first ever Chief utility relations as larger cities with more resources available these two cities are seeking a new relationship with clean water services both want to take on more responsibility for sanitarian stromar activities within their respective jurisdictions while still working effectively with CWS to co-implement our npdes permit requirements we have spent a large amount of time with staff when it within each City talking through the various components of our operating partnership listening and learning from each other along the like so many organizations there are many new people in new roles at both cities so it has been a very healthy informative process to learn about the many different ways that we partner and work together in addition to RUSD staff this process has involved staff from across many departments within clean water services including Regulatory Affairs Finance field operations and our legal team we are now at the important phase of drafting the new IGA language with both cities with the target of completing the final draft by July while I'm excited that we will have a new updated and refreshed agreement with both cities soon the real long-term benefit from this effort will be the strengthen relationships and mutual understanding of the value of our partnership with these two cities that is the real dividend I see for the future with both cities next slide but you're right go ahead you're work doesn't stop no Okay no Okay after the final drafts are complete we'll go for board approval we will go to both City councils and these two new igas will basically become uh the starting point for conversations with our other City Partners it's to make sure we understood this Milestone right of having joint meetings correct okay thank you chair next slide please another important effort within RUSD has been working closely with our city Partners along with other utilities such as PGE and Northwest Natural to prepare for infrastructure improvements to support industrial Readiness as well as for residential and other types of in 2021 as you've heard a number of times today we completed the East Basin master plan for our regional sanitary system and treatment facilities and we are currently in the midst of developing our West Basin master plan these sanitary Master plans are 20-year plans that will help us determine the critical strategic Investments that we will need to make to meet the needs of growth within both basins both Master plans are based upon gaining a deeper knowledge and understanding of what our respective City Partners Envision for their communities and how we can help them achieve their Community recently our preliminary work on the west Basin master plan has been critically valuable to rusd's work to coordinate with North Plains in Hillsboro on the potential semiconductor opportunities related to the federal chips Act as you may know Tracy Rainey from our governmental Affairs team has been down in Salem a number of times this session to testify to the Joint Committee on semiconductors about the importance of sanitary and stormwater infrastructure to the semiconductor and advanced manufacturing sectors our team has developed preliminary infrastructure improvements and costs that would be needed to serve a large semiconductor facility in either North Plains or Hillsborough we are working hard to be better prepared for these and other type of development opportunities within our service boundaries next slide if I get if I just touch on that for a second Joe you know I have conversations with the mayor North Plains and and their staff about their Urban ground Urban growth boundary development you know their growth residential growth all those kinds of things it would or if we just stopped there and we don't include the semiconductor activity are set I guess as they for future services and this future growth or is there going to be some enhancements on Clean Water Services part that's going to be necessary there will probably need to be improvements but that's the whole basis of the West Basin master plan is looking at at least on the sanitary side of our work in terms of preparing for what their growth aspirations are and what they want to do it's just been kind of elevated with this whole semiconductor opportunity that has popped up in the last six to eight months yeah because I could I could imagine 10 years from now they'll be double the size they are correct so correct yeah okay still with no grocery store that's coming hopefully follow through if they're able to follow through on the reworking or revisioning of the area at Roy Rogers and LeBeau Road for say a 200 acre uh flat Industrial Area will you be needing to do some additional work there or do you have capacity already in that area because of everything you've done great question we are working with Sherwood we need a new pump station actually that we are looking at a site along Roy Rogers that the city actually owns to put a new pump station to serve that Sherwood West area that's the largest Improvement it might need to be different if it's a semiconductor or Advanced manufacturing type facility but that's the largest size to the occasion to be an item on a bullet list like that at this point okay thank you next slide last RUSD will continue to lead efforts in the coming year to partner with our 12 cities in a variety of ways we have increased our educational opportunities for city leaders and staff such as CWS Essentials that the chair mentioned earlier today and various tours within our Watershed and our facilities our monthly Community Action newsletter goes out to elected officials within all of our cities Special Districts and Metro highlighting key projects initiatives and news from the district we have an amazing group of project engineers and Technical staff within our organization you've heard that throughout today's presentation but I'm very pleased that we added another planner to our systems planning team this past year with that additional planner we are much better positioned to work earlier in the concept development planning phase in these expansion areas in cities such as Sherwood King City Tigard and Beaverton this earlier engagement with our cities will prove to be beneficial as we incorporate our knowledge and expertise into their early planning efforts and it's as a former planner it's nice to have more planners in our organization so that's all except for the next slide and I'll take any questions the board may have Joy just like thank you for including c-wac on the community connections newsletter always like seeing that show those Partnerships are great are there any areas of growth that CWS is concerned about that it foresies in three five six years that could potentially have a challenge serving I think the game changer thank you for that question would be a semiconductor type facility in North plains or Hillsborough for example something in the 500 plus acres that would be a game changer in terms of figuring out how to do that and do it in a timely manner and it as Diane had said earlier those those are big dollar costs that would be the biggest challenge that I see I think the other things we're doing we're trying to manage that growth and work with our partners and anticipate it and I think the the Basin planning that we are doing in a sanitary is key to that and we also do that we'll be doing that with our sub Basin planning in storm water and surface water management to get around that and anticipate the growth there as well good to hear thank you does anybody remember if there is a deadline by which companies have to as a three years commitment I think it's either 18 months or 24. yeah still way out there okay I I don't have a question I just want to say Joe I'm really glad that you're here and I think that in your title the word relationship really speaks to who you are and watching the work that you've done with the cities with constituents whomever you it's really nice to have you here and I really appreciate the work that you and your department are doing it's it was a great change in the organization thank you I really appreciate that there's nothing else I'll leave it the best for last right Bob thank you Joe your song members of the committee my name is Bob Baumgartner I am the director for Regulatory Affairs I'm here to talk to you today about our Regulatory Affairs budget uh and with that I want",

        "text": " information for all our guest speakers today so if people have questions they can follow up outside of today's meeting i'll also encourage folks with substantive questions about the federal siding leasing and permitting processes to track and participate in the baum oregon task force process and i will pause us um after each speaker um to do a quick check for any big questions and questions can also be asked in the chat and we can come back to questions um or additional input on these topics during the time for additional citing and permitting later on so if that all sounds good i will turn it over to whitney hower with the bureau of ocean management hi great thank you so hello my name is whitney howard i'm a renewable energy specialist with the bureau of ocean energy management balm in the pacific regional office and i want to thank odo and thank you jason for the invitation to present um on on bowman's activities at this public meeting today next slide so for uh to those who are unaware of of bone we're a relatively small regulatory agency and we're within the u.s department of the interior and our mission is to manage the development of energy and mineral resources on the u.s outer continental shelf for ocs and today i'm going to focus on offshore wind energy pacific region our jurisdiction is comprised of the ocs offshore washington oregon in california shown on this map as well as hawaii and our jurisdiction is from three to two hundred nautical miles offshore i wanna make a an um an important point in that there are two fundamental things that bone does to carry out its mission and the first is that bone provides access to the renewable energy resources by issuing leases on the ocs to and the second is that boehm has the review authority for the developers plans on how they will develop the next slide we do have an environmental studies this funds and manages scientific research to inform policy decisions and i hope that some of these studies are are helpful to the the lit review and if you want to learn more about foam study the development process the studies in the pacific region or studies in forming renewable energy offshore oregon i've provided a few links for everyone's resource next slide so this is the heart of of the bone process this shows the four phases of the offshore wind energy authorization process and it's relatively complex and it takes a long time and i just want to highlight a few key points so the first phase in our process is planning an analysis and in this phase boem identifies areas suitable for leasing through a winnowing process so we generally start by gathering data and information and to inform a broad area of planning and then by coordinating with partners analyzing the data and with the first round of environmental review we narrowed down to a specific area that would be offered for lease bones typical forum for intergovernmental coordination is through the intergovernmental renewable energy task force which jason referenced and in oregon we're in the first phase of planning so specifically boehm anticipates to issue a call for information and nominations to solicit information in and around particular areas for consideration and to solicit nominations for commercial interest from industry in the second phase it's leasing and here boehm publishes leasing notices that describe how leases will be issued in the terms of a lease auction boom holds a competitive lease auction and issues leases it's important to note that foam does not give the developer the right to a wind farm and that the lease grant the developer the right to submit plan for phone's review and approval after lease issuance and after approved plans lessee or the developer conducts surveys and may install a meteorological buoy to gather site specific data deluxey has up to five years to do this site assessment and characterization and then submit their construction and operations plan or cop for bone review which leads to the fourth phase so with a cop we see the developers proposed project this is the size and the number of wind turbine array of the wind farm its spacing its mooring and anchoring design the submarine cable route and so on foam does it in another environmental review and decides whether to approve or approve with mitigations or disapprove the project if approved along with other reports the lessee can then construct their so boehm's early commercial win leases had an initial term of 25 years and we're now seeing commercial operating terms of 33 years with these east coast next slide jason already touched on the bohm task force and this is a partnership with federal state local agencies and tribal the task force in oregon was established in 2011 and it provides input into bones decision making process as jason also mentioned the oregon department of land conservation and development dlcd is our partner in the task force meeting planning the conversation of offshore wind in oregon began in 2019 and we outlined how we would conduct our data gathering and engagement effort and in 2020 baum and the state committed to offshore wind energy planning and that plan was finalized which is available on our website bowman dlcd conducted outreach and engagement with 75 meetings with potentially interested and affected parties hosted six public webinars dlc led the charge of aurawinmap providing a data catalog and data visualization with the best available and publicly available information last fall we discussed the outcome of this data gathering engagement effort and a final summary is available on our webpage and this report details the key input that we receive from the public from tribes and stakeholder engagement meetings two weeks ago bowman the state convened the 10th task force meeting virtually where we discussed the next stage in our authorization process and included the discussion of proposed call areas next slide so in oregon we are coordinating with this date and developing call areas large enough for flexibility and refinement through our authorization process from the call to wind energy area designation we're focused where the commercial viability is greatest which aligns where the wind resource is the strongest so we are considering three gigawatts for near-term development offshore and there are three proposed areas um these are the three call areas offshore south central and southern oregon so from north to south this is the coos bay call area the abandoned call area and the brookings call area if we estimate the power capacity considering a power density of three megawatts per square kilometer these three proposed call areas total approximately 17 gigawatts of offshore wind energy the considerations of the call are preliminary and their bet based on best available information and we do look forward to continue the data gathering um the analysis and refinement on these areas for potential leasing and in today's presentation i don't have the time to walk through the considerations on how we delineated these areas but if you go to our webpage you can find the full presentation from the task force meeting next slide so boem anticipates issuing the call for information and nominations by the end of this month or in the beginning of and there will be a public comment period to solicit information in and around the call areas on existing uses any environmental information or and it also solicits nominations of interest from from development for development from developers from the offshore wind energy industry the call is a federal register notice and that document fully explains the rationale of the call areas after the call is issued we look forward to continue data gathering and analysis and refine these areas in the area identification stage once the wind energy area is designated begins environmental review which is anticipated for this fall and then activities next year would lead up to a lease sale potentially in the fall of 2023 next slide just want to thank you all for your attention and please please my contact information is is here please feel free to reach out and and stay informed thank you great thanks whitney um just a quick check in if excuse me if um i don't know if that we noticed any um questions in the chat thanks um jason i'm not seeing any questions in the chat for whitney yet um if some pop up um maybe we'll hit him in the next next pause or at the end when we're doing initial feedback another round of feedback thank you oops sorry andy i'll turn it over to andy lanier with oregon department of land conservation and development hey good morning everyone just confirming you can hear me looks like my mic is working yup um thank you i'm the marine affairs coordinator for the department of land conservation and development and today i wanted to talk a little bit about the ability of the state to influence the boem process as well as our role in citing as we move further on in the development and consideration of go ahead and move forward the first thing i wanted to do though is just make sure that everyone was familiar with the oregon coastal management program we are a program that's one of 34 kind of states around the country that an approved coastal zone management plan in partnership with noaa and one of the benefits of doing so is it allows the application of state and noaa approved policies and plans at a state level to activities of the federal agencies and one of the benefits of being an approved program is that you have the ability to use federal consistency authority and that authority comes in in the shape of federal consistency reviews and one of the ways that the state looks at this and considers this is that we are a networked program so all of the city and county comprehensive growth plans that the state has adopted as a part of its land use planning program have become a part of oregon's federally proved coastal zone program specifically the state has coastal management goals goal 19 being the foundational goal for ocean resources but other coastal goals having a role as well so that networked nature of our program state and local policies to be applied and to influence potential federal actions next slide so federal consistency applies throughout the oregon coastal zone and that goes from the crest of the coast range out three nautical miles into the territorial sea and it's based upon any projects within that area that have reasonably foreseeable impacts to coastal resources the state has also asked for an applied to noaa for the ability to review projects that fall outside of our coastal zone where they have specific foreseeable effects to resources within the state that the state cares about and has enforceable policies and the state does have an approved it's actually the only one on the west coast geographic location description out into the outer continental shelf specifically for marine",

        "text": " um and the international Regional coordinations that this uh Council has kind of allowed us to U participate in and kind of make Oregon uh a really powerful player even though we are just a subnational at the national and international levels um and then come up some of our thoughts on aligning our priorities with the um global warming commission and then uh just like Eric time for questions and comments we definitely want to try and align with you as much as we can gain from each other since there's a lot of crossover in the work we do next slide Zach um so first off the science of O why it's happening and the impacts our slide um so actually Jenny do you want to cover these first ones absolutely yeah thanks so just to begin I want to start with a baseline of what is causing ocean acidification so likely everyone in this meeting is familiar with the Keeling curve this graph that I have pulled up and this red kind of squiggly line that goes upward represents the increasing carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and something that you all might be less familiar with is this green kind of noisy line that follows the red line that represents the dissolved carbon dioxide or pco2 within our oceans so we can see from this figure that as our atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased as has our dissolved carbon dioxide in the ocean um and that's a simple diffusion process um and then as a result of this increasing dissolved carbon dioxide in the ocean you can see this blue line that Trends downward and that's the pH in the ocean so we have this direct correlation where as the pco2 increases our acidity has been decreasing over time next slide please and so ocean acidification is the process that occurs as we have that dissolved o or dissolved carbon dioxide in the water leading to those pH changes and that's one aspect of our Council but the other aspect we have is sort of the sister of ocean acidification or ocean hypoxia and within the Pacific Northwest specifically um a lot of our ocean hypoxia is driven by upwelling and changes in upwelling due to climate change in particular we have fantastic upwelling on the Oregon coast it's what fuels a lot of our great productivity in this area but when there's times when the upwelling happens at different prolonged periods of times or at um strengths uh what we'll see is so many nutrients will come up from above that it'll fuel a mass Plankton Bloom and this Plankton will grow and grow and grow and eventually it will reach its carrying capacity or overreach it and everything will die off and once it dies off that results in a lot of decomposition that draws a lot of oxygen out from the water and this can turn into what some people refer to as dead zones or areas of hypoxia or low oxygen and how climate change kind of fits in here is that our upwelling processes are highly impacted by winds and as we know climate change is leading to alterations of wind and weather patterns and that's leading to what we're seeing um is more frequent and stronger hypoxic events next slide please so to give a brief example of what some data looks like in Oregon regarding hypoxia we can look at an observation that's really close to Cape Perpetual one of our marine reserves on the central Oregon coast so on this figure you'll see a black line that represents the average dissolved oxygen from 2009 to 202 1 um these gray bars are going to show your standard deviation and the red line will be your 2021 dissolved oxygen levels in this area in Coast in central Coastal Oregon and if you could just Advance the slide really quick I think there will be a change yes what I specifically want to point out here is that we're seeing levels of dissolved oxygen that are near zero so it's very difficult for an organism to survive in low oxygen conditions about 1.4 Mill milliliters per liter is what we consider hypoxic or very low oxygen but we're actually seeing levels that are near zero and so that's incredibly difficult for an organism to survive when there's no Oxygen around next slide please and what's important to point out here is that as we have different levels of oxygen in the water there are a variety of different impacts to the ecosystem so if we have a full oxygen saturation we're looking at normal behavior businesses you usual but as we decrease our oxygen saturation we'll see that mobile species those species that can get away will get away um eventually we'll see fish and crab leave the area um but even as it decreases we'll have changes to the biogeochemistry of the soil microbial mats forming um and you know at 0% oxygen no macron is going to be able to survive next slide please and one more slide and okay and I can go into a little bit about what the ocean aerification and hypoxia Council has done and what Oregon has done to act on this issue next slide please so in 2017 the Oregon ocean acidification and hypoxia Council was established through Senate Bill 1039 this founding piece of legislation made sure that our Council would be in action it designated seats um and it provided no sunset for our Council so essentially we'll be um existing as long as ocean acidification and hypoxia is an issue next slide please our council is made up of a diverse 13 seat group um in this image you'll see the top left Familiar Faces Dr Lori janic and DR leaf rasmason who are our co-chairs and we also have a variety of representation on the council representing three different agencies um the Oregon ocean science trust Oregon sea Grant a conservation and Recreation seat two members of the Harvest and fishing Community an academic a tribal committee tribal Community member and then a representative from the Oregon uh governor's office specifically the natural resources department next slide please and what our work covers is essentially five main themes and these themes are borrowed from the or International Alliance to combat ocean acidification which really prompted a lot of these action plans being formed all across the West Coast so specifically our actions theme one focuses on Gathering more information and better understanding the science around ocean acidification and hypoxia theme two specifically targets ways that we can reduce the causes of ocean acidification in hypoxia specifically that's going to be carbon dioxide management and mitigation and those are those will include greenhouse gas techniques our third theme is finding ways to have more adaptation and resilience within our natural ecosystems to ocean acidification and hypoxia our fourth theme is spreading more information about ocean acidification and hypoxia whether it be with local communities or with policy makers and our last theme is develop more coordination and more work um together with different agencies or entities in Oregon to help combat this issue so our meeting here today is really all about that theme five and just learning ways that we can better work together next please and I won't let you know everything that we've done since we've been started in 2017 but a couple of our biggest accomplishments and that are noteworthy for this conversation is that in 2019 we developed Oregon's ocean acidic ation and hypoxia action plan this is a six-year action plan that was adopted by the governor's office and we are beginning to plan for our next action plan uh we also produce biannual reports in even years and those are updates to what we've done on our action plan and where we intend to go additionally we've hosted five fisherman scientist ocean dis ification and hypoxia roundtables in collaboration with crant and essentially these are opportunities for atrisk industy industry members in the fishing Community to sit down with scientists and managers to talk about what to expect coming up what are they seeing and what questions they have going forward um it also is a great way to expand trust within those two groups because as we know as ocean and climate change advances we're going to see changes in this Arena um additionally we coordinated a multi-agency report on ocean acidification and hypoxia and although this is only a report it was a great opport opportunity to get our eight agencies that have a Nexus with oh to communicate each other and talk about ways that they want to work together on ways to address this issue um especially keeping the efficient use of State resources in mind uh really recently in 2021 we supported the passage of house spill 3114 and this was a novel investment on ocean acidification the hypoxia within the state of Oregon $1.9 million were allocated towards 13 different projects um and they span from Gathering more information to getting adaptation and resilience strategies and we're also developing an ocean acidification and hypoxia Communications plan that should be done by the end of next year which is exciting and lastly the first thing the first Symposium ever on ocean acidification and hypoxia was organized earlier this year and it was an opportunity for those who were funded by this $1.9 billion investment to share out with the public on what we are learning where we' come next slide please and so just as a an update then again on that house bill 3114 um we were really pleased to have that passed and we are looking forward to the results from that next slide please okay I'll step back in at this point um so like I said the O Council has been a great Nexus for us within Oregon but Oregon has really been a leader uh kind of on the national and international scale and so these are kind of some of the things that this Council has allowed us to move into those uh different other uh Arenas as we move forward so next slide so the first one probably something that many of you are partners with is that there is uh the Pacific coast collaborative the PCC that many of us are aware of um there is a subcommittee for um oah um that has then since broken off and become uh the OA Alliance which we'll go into more on the next slide but um this group has really done a lot of work to kind of form across border efforts to look at ocean change kind of uh centralized messaging associated with oah so that the whole West Coast is looking at things in a unified front or presenting it in a unified front um and things like that again really with the main goal of a centralized message for the West Coast um in our introduction to science you know ocean acidification is hitting the West Coast United States harder than anywhere",

        "text": " process it's a big lift this involves a lot of your time a lot of Staff time a lot of Community member time so we want to use that to pull Advantage try to get ourselves up prioritized list for five years and then each year as the CIP process moves forward we have the opportunity to address unforeseen circumstances changes that have happened cost increases other things will provide an annual adjustment as we're also moving forward we have some opportunities here and we'll be talking with some of you further about things like as we move this program forward should we incorporate more expectation around City share requirements for City priority projects and that could be modeled something similar to the bonding cost sharing program where we have agreed as the county and the cities to share costs for projects that the county sponsored in the bonding cautionary program we came up with other County revenue sources outside of mstip to make sure that we were also paying a local share if you will for those Improvement so that we were on a somewhat equal footing with with our city partners and again just the opportunity for advancing Equity as we make this transition to next slide so this is sort of a conceptual graphic to just try to help illustrate some of the things that I've been trying to talk with you about and just make sure that we're being clear so we really have three sort of inputs as we're thinking about how the mstip process sort of moves into this Capital Improvement planning process so we we have the existing prior mscip projects and that's through the 3d3e bonding cost sharing programs we want to continue advancing those projects um we are also planning for a next round of future Improvement projects so we did a lot of work you'll remember and the mstip 2328 prioritization effort we want to bring that work forward it was all good work and it's still relevant so we want to carry that forward into this and then we've had some historic program allocations within mstip and the big one probably is the opportunity fund but we've also had some smaller rural bridge set-asides and uh an intelligent transportation system set so we'll be looking at opportunities to carry those things forward and there was something in Chris's presentation I wanted to mention here too so the opportunity fund a good name for that might also be the leverage fund so we've really been successful using those local dollars to go out and get return on investment using uh regional state and federal funds and we've returned around six to one uh so for every dollar of mscip we bring in about six dollars of outside funds to help Advance critical Transportation improvements here in the so we'll be bringing all of those three things together in the CIP process running them through our filter policies priorities and available funding and then we'll move forward with the outcome of that and you'll notice on the left side of the slide we've listed those three things as step one two and three we're kind of looking at them in that order and there will be iterative processes we'll be going from you know step one and doing some what ifs and see what that means for step two and step three and then maybe circling back again to Step One so it won't be a direct linear process but we're really starting with this idea of how do we address the funding gap for projects that the board has previously approved for funding and then on top of that then how do we start to roll in additional projects so that we have work ahead of us going forward and then those programmatic allocations as well next slide so as I mentioned we want to just keep keep moving ahead with that MST ip2328 work bring that in here we got pretty far in that process we had project cost estimates which were actually needing to update now because of ongoing cost but there were a list of 25 potential projects that we were planning to bring back before the wccc for the recommendation eventually to the board so you can see some of the components that were included in that work and then we paused that effort because as we were really identifying two things one was just the size of the funding Gap that we're dealing with and trying to get our arms around that we also did go through a process of developing an initial Capital Improvement plan for this current fiscal year 2324 which really functions more as an inventory of known projects at this point rather than a uh a true pre-planned Capital Improvement project list so so we're definitely going to be evolving our work in our CIP process in this upcoming year and then we'll be asking our board to adopt a more robust Capital Improvement plan for FY 2425 next slide so we just want to give you a few Road markers along the way here we'll be continuing to do some work on addressing these funding Gap scenarios looking again at Future Transportation project opportunities so pulling in some of that work from the mstip 2328 process refining those funding scenarios over the winter and then coming back and talking a little bit further about the policies and procedures for the capital Improvement plan and then refining these specific project priorities as we move into spring um oh and uh we lost a star along the way here somewhere but uh we'll be asking the board to adopt the county CIP here late spring of 2024. you can see a couple spots the stars with you both both The Bold and the lighter line that's really where we're anticipating wccc briefings and I want to be clear too we'll be keeping you updated on a monthly basis at each of our wccc meetings about progress that we're making on these on these topics so we may or may not have a formal briefing scheduled there and I think that's a next slide so a couple of discussion questions I know we're running pretty far behind on um and I just want to say that I'll be available anytime if anyone has questions specific to any projects that you have already in the queue or questions about where we're going here and then we may have just a few minutes here for some q a Time thank you questions for Stephen mayor Callaway then mayor Lube then mayor Rosner okay quickly so you know seeing as how we are transitioning um then when I hear the term work together it just sounds to me like don't argue don't don't push back don't disagree and um so please understand I am trying to work um I am concerned you know as we talk about closing the Gap proactive Solutions missing on that is working with Metro you know state and federal um you know because of m-step we have not had the need for some of the metro area funding that has gone to Portland and east memorial County and other um we then need to make sure in a proactive sense that we are going to lean heavily on our Metro counselors to deliver for us in the way that previously uh they didn't have to secondly when we talk about Keep From the Past m-step process the one thing that is glaring that is missing is nowhere in there do we do we mention keeping the trust of the public and the public voted for this multiple times over and over and I feel that moving this money away from what the voters intended and approved multiple times I specifically begins to deteriorate that public trust and um I will you know the exploration of program changes there's some things in there that red raised red flags but I'll close with advancing Equity it doesn't say Advanced Equity through the projects it just says ex you know Advanced Equity through the process and I worry then about Cornelius um which has Equitable and deserves Equitable approach and need not getting um not getting what they need because Equity is just the process and not the projects and not the outcomes thanks um thank you if I if I could I want to just say I'm certainly not Our intention discourage conversation and and push back I mean I think this is a two-way conversation so we certainly anticipate um I think on your question about sort of voter intent I I know it's just been a long time since the voters approved the mscip quite some time ago and I I just want to be clear that at this point the board's one action I think in that regard has been the one time reduction in the general fund transfer this year or not what the future looks like that's a conversation that I can't foresee at this point but um so I know that that was obviously a need to address a gap for this uh this past or this current rather budget year um so I think that will be an ongoing discussion of course about what happens in the future maybe that's it thank you rear Lou yeah thank you um you know today's been an interesting conversation on transportation and the lack of transportation funding and it just continues um and I I forget which mayor said it but you know as it continues to run downhill right it ends up in our cities because we're we're the first stop of where people have issues I can't tell you how many times how loudly we say Hall's not ours and yet that is the number one complaint that I received from my community and so it's just it's so critical hearing this environment that we're in with all of these funding challenges that um you know Washington County it's so funding this misstep um it's so critical for our roads to to fund and and to have this available for our projects so we really want to be committed to being in partnership with developing the CIP projects and working with the criteria and working on that especially from the Equitable side and I think safety is an incredible and Incredibly important aspect of that um you know and and plugging projects that we have that that fit that criteria that weren't quite on the project list but are coming up and so working in partnership with that but really again emphasizing you know mayor Beatty talks about her 10 million dollar shortfall we there just isn't the extra funding out there for for our roads and so this is really a critical place for us to to be able to continue to support transportation funding so just wanted to add that thank you I appreciate that um and I sorry I wanted to go back to uh mayor Callaway one of the comments too around equity and um and I may not have said it clearly but we are definitely thinking about Equity both in terms of project selection what the projects do for our communities and then also sort of on the procurement side as well so trying to take a holistic look at that so thank you I'm mayor Rosner the mayor Betty uh thanks and uh Stephen thanks for",

each of the sites evaluated you know matter and and change the outcome of the visual impact assessment and that concludes my my portion oh except oh i'm nope wait wait no i forgot okay i just i just wanted to just i just wanted it to and now i'm gonna continue with scenic okay oh that's large okay okay so for scenic resources the analysis area protected areas went out 20 for scenic resources we go out 10 scenic resources and as the the the explains to us are that these are resources that have um identified as significant or important in land management plans from federal agencies state agencies tribal governments so the task here to evaluate scenic resources is it's several steps we go through the the management plans or the applicant and then the department goes through the management plans and there are resources identified and we look at those resources and whether or not they're our identity but are they managed for their scenic values and importance and if so then they're captured and evaluated underneath the scenic resources standard there's 33 33 important or significant scenic resources within the 10-mile analysis area that the department concurred with in the proposed order and evaluated seven of them are crossed by the proposed facility i have this we're just talking about visual impacts again we're not looking at any particular this presentation i'm not looking at any particular one i'm just trying to orient counsel to the information that's in the record and some of what the department looked at in drafting the findings in the proposed order so this is a visual impact you know uh assessment based on these visual impact assessments you're like what am i looking at here and so here these are types of different scenic resources um and the coloring is over here it the pink is an area where one or more towers may be visible up to 10 miles so then kind of looking at this and the designation of resources this is what orients the applicant to do more is there a particular resource under any of these standards where they need to go out and do more and there were um photo simulations uh provided for some of the areas um and that's where they they're kops it's a key observation point and those are areas at a particular resource where photos were taken and then towers would be drawn in to demonstrate um the the magnitude or intensity of a visual impact okay and so there are conditions under scenic resources um condition two is um and there are uh conditions that the applicant minimize visual impacts at a particular and a lot of those are a particular type of tower and with a particular type of finish here under scenic resources condition two this is back to lad marsh we have some tower modifications which would be intended to reduce visual impacts okay and then um the set of the scenic resources condition four is specific to a birch creek area and this is another example where within this area we're doing they're doing proposing a design modification that's intended to reduce the visual impacts at that area and then these areas for instance birch creek birch creek gets captured under protected areas it gets captured under and then it also it is evaluated under the historic cultural and archaeological resources standard so this is one of these areas that also that hpmp of that historical resources that hp mp is the the mitigation in there well the final mitigation will also apply to this area as well in addition to this and now i'm going to pass it off to you jesse okay so we'll be moving first to scenic resources issue number three the limited party is dechner issue is whether the applicant adequately assessed the visual impact of the proposed project in the vicinity of the narcotic and properly determined the impact would be less than the hearing officer's proposed order on this issue stated that she concluded that the applicant accurately assess the visual impact of the proposed project in the vicinity of nahotic and properly determined that the impact would be less than significant as defined by council the standard does not require a demonstration of no impact it requires a demonstration of no significant impact and specifically allows for consideration of mitigation and again as kellen had referenced here the council rules do provide a definition of significant and in the context of this issue the hearing officer was noting that it's not appropriate as a result to look to a definition to interpret that term the hearing officer also concluded that the applicant refined its visual impact assessment to consider the council's definition of significant as requested by the department and the application uh she also found that the proposed facility would be visible from the nahotic parcel um that uh would be within at one point within 123 feet of the parcel boundary but existing development within landscape and design modifications and additional that with those mitigating factors that the evidence in the record was sufficient to establish that the impacts would be less than so that is the summary of the hearing officer's proposed contest case order with regard to issue sr3 and we can have our argument from i couldn't see the screen yesterday so i brought my own and that's my presentation that you're that's my that's it you know what to tell you any questions thank you for the record todd cornett uh councilmember jacques toot so a a handout was submitted to us in the room we're going to take a picture of that and email it to you so you have it as for what it's worth i do believe it's in the written record as well thank you thank you good afternoon council members for the record this is jocelyn pease for idaho power company um and in response to mr deshner's written exceptions i wanted to just highlight a few points the detailed analysis and exhibits lrnt of idaho power's application for site certificate demonstrate that idaho power adequately assessed visual impacts to the nahotic and demonstrated that those impacts will be less than significant mr dushner's challenges to the proposed contested case order are all either unsupported by evidence in the record or misapply the applicable council in his exceptions filing mr dechner repeatedly argues that idaho power is not adequately mitigated the project's visual impact to minnehotic because the project will be visible idaho power is not required any under any f-sec standard to demonstrate that the project will result in zero impacts if there were a zero impact standard no energy facilities could ever be developed in oregon rather idaho power must demonstrate that the facilities that the construction operation of the project is not likely to result in a significant adverse impact accordingly mr dustner's contention that the towers will still be visible does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence in the record that visual impacts from those towers are inconsistent with the applicable sighting standards mr deshner also argues that the project towers have not been mitigated because they will be taller than existing transmission towers however idaho power's expert witness louise kling provided testimony and evidence demonstrating that the project will be co-dominant with the existing features on the landscape including the existing transmission line and i would point out that in the proposed order there are regarding the the nihotic the transmission line and the nahotic which would require that the towers be the h-frames that they be um built to a certain height to be 130 feet or less to reduce the visual and also that they be that they use a certain finish so that there would be less reflection or glare so based on on those conditions the council can find that idaho power has met the standard in this case msps any questions from council patrick crow department of justice on behalf of the department of energy sorry i just want to re-read the issue for this issue so it's in the contested case it's issue sr3 whether the app can adequately address the visual impact of the proposed in the vicinity of the nahotic national historic oregon trail interpretive center and properly determined the impact would be less than significant so that's really asking two questions did idaho power adequately assess the visual impact of the line near nahotek and second is it proper to conclude that impact will be less than significant mr destiner's exceptions to the aljs proposed contested case order focus on that second question whether it's proper to conclude that the impact will be less than significant mr deschner clearly disagrees with the alj's conclusion we agree with idol power that he hasn't shown that the alj failed to consider relevant evidence or make conclusions based on substantial the department believes that there is a preponderance of evidence again that's the standard that supports a conclusion that the with mitigation will will be less than significant and those conditions are the recommended scenic resource conditions three on page 417 and 4 on page 423 so the department again is recommending that you find compliance with the with the standard with those with the mitigation outlined in those conditions as i've noted with other conditions that the department has proposed if council believes that the conditions should be revised or supplemented in any way now would be the time to to let us know council row any questions from the council for the record this is perry chalk to and i'm reviewing the a picture that was sent to me i had a couple questions of why is it inside a window inside a home when the real impacts happen when you go out and see the grid as a whole and hear the noise that it makes so um council member chuck dude i think that that question would probably be best asked of mr destner since he was the one who submitted the photo you're welcome to have him come back up and answer the question if you'd like okay to have the meeting move along which is in between file post 197.9 and 199.1 is that the visual impact is that why that distance was selected in the condition for the record kellen tardy weather um yes let me let me find this condition can you point me to line 13 of condition number four am i in the wrong place i don't i think it's condition two one minute yes um in short that would have been in the areas where there are a limitation on the mile posts for certain height restrictions or tower types it's because that's what is estimated to be the visual right and you said it's three scenic resources three oh wait yeah scenic 3. i don't really reference scenic resources condition 4 that applies to a different resource

        "text": " I part of me is um I don't know because we're providing the subsidy why isn't it branded chariots like Enterprise a for-profit business instead gets all the branding credit and if we are making a value decision here about how we allocate limited resources you know I would love for fr's lumber to see when a van P pulls in that that's a chariot van not a commute by Enterprise van and I know that was a decision made a few years ago to consolidate branding under a unified thing so it's not a question with an answer for today but it's something I want to flag as to my personal preference would be that we get the credit for the subsidy in from a branding perspective maybe there's perfectly reasonable legal reasons for why we don't do that anymore but just wanted to flag that and then um the last thing is as you look at West Salem I I want to channel hen or or director Lura mkff right now to say uh that I I would be very curious especially once the comprehensive operation analysis is done to take a look at how travel patterns on our West Salem routes have changed because of the youth zero Pass Program and I I based on some of this high level data I have some hunches but I would love to see a closer look at that and maybe in a redesign that takes into account the locational W Salem High for example so again not a question just a some more rambling but that's that's the extent of my rambling yeah for now thank you so much I think that's a really good comments we're exploring the improving the mobility in the W Salem to rout 26 27 and how we can better serve COA will definitely help us um to reshape the mobility in that Reg in specific area and we're also exploring if there is microtransit or any other Solutions can serve the area better than fixure so this is on our radar we're actively working on that thanks for the comments you any other questions from folks no okay well thank you very much for your presentation and I also appreciate you like kind of anticipating some of our questions for example like the one in in February where you knew that we were going to be like why what's the difference so thank you very much again thank you so much alrighty we'll get it back over to General Manager Pollock for calling up our next great we have to find a correct term so oh you don't believe our next report is no I believe you but a better term uh the fiscal year 24 Q3 financial report I'll ask CFO uh Laro to please come good evening president Eno host pressy and members of the board I'm here tonight to provide the financial overview for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 the detailed memo and financial statements are on pages 52 through 55 in your packet for your review but referring to the overview we had a lot of activity for audits that were finished up in Q3 the report of independent Auditors the deficiencies in internal controls and the fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations were all complet completed in quarter three with no deficiencies the NTD agreed upon procedures uh annual uh was not uh completed by the end of quarter 3 it has been by now so so that's a quarter four but that was also completed without deficiencies the gfoa Excellence in financial reporting award is now under review for this now 12th year so we will hear about that later uh in the fy2 fiscal year is when we'll get the results on that next slide please the general fund uh financial performance the year-to-date revenues uh which we would expect to see them at 75% or above for the uh 34s uh we're at 86% the expenditures should be below 75% and year-to date we are at 65% the largest percentage is in the finance division at 69% and the lowest percentage is in the general manager division at 51% for the transportation programs fund the revenues are currently at 21% uh this is trending low because we have our 5307 funding that has been put into trams but it takes a lot of processing time so we're waiting for that to be obligated as soon as that's obligated we can draw that down and recognize the revenue if we don't if that is not processed by the end of the fiscal year then we will go ahead and acrw it so we will have it in this fiscal year um regardless and then for the expenditures again we should be at 75% or or less and we're at 61% for the transportation programs fund the capital fund financial performance is it is trending at 31% so it's been consistent throughout the year and many of the projects as you know are rolling into fy2 and then the expenditures are at 48% and those include uh expenditures for the battery electric bus infrastructure the transit signal priority work the it s project bus stop improvements technology equipment and South Salem Transit Center were all um projects that had more expense in the third quarter so they're moving along nicely for the Strategic plan the climate action plan began the procurement process in the third quarter for the battery electric bus integration year-to date we've now spent $1.9 million in this fiscal year the community value surveys and customer satisfaction surveys were completed we just haven't received the final Billings yet uh so that will fall into the fourth quarter the Chariots intelligent transportation system incurred expenses in the third quarter of $277,000 so that's moving along well and the clean and safe passenger amenities the additional facilities maintenance Staffing that we hire hired um to uh keep our shelters and and Facilities clean uh we've spent $882,000 for the year on that initiative and then the employee engagement survey was started on April 1 so that's falling into fourth quarter are there any questions um I'm looking over here any questions sure okay director Davidson thank you president you know host pressy um for the property tax I saw that we were at 103% of projected is that uh and you'll have to forgive me I don't recall past um reports at this point is is that a reflection of us being conservative in budgeting and then often getting more property tax uh revenues or is this you know I guess why why more than what we expected uh we are relative we try to be very realistic uh so that extra 3% is is within the normal range of where we normally fall and we also don't we very rarely ever receive anything in the fourth quarter of the year uh that last May tax payment um is just a very small small amount thank you any other questions no I I have have um a question that's just uh tickling my brain I guess on the capital expenses requirement summary by division um it says that finances negative - 27% of the budget could you tell me like how that happens oh yes we had a that was for the uh Tyler munus project and we had an acrel for the previous year um that reversed in the current year so that's been an ongoing multi-year project but that was a a carryover of the previous year okay yeah that makes sense if there's no other questions then thank you very much for your presentation thank you okay so that brings us to our general manager report thank you I have a couple items to report so you should have at your tables your your board information sheet of activities for the coming uh month uh also uh couple weeks ago we kicked off Route 22 it's uh slowly increasing in ridership uh just to give you you know 49 people per day week one or 29 people per day week 1 49 week two slowly gaining in ridership and awareness um hopefully it we will will continue to pick up uh I think some of you heard we've had some some concerns about some of the routing uh in a neighborhood so we've been working with the the representatives if you will on that and working through that and ultimately we plan to have a little open house with them to go through some understandings uh um so that everyone's up hearing directly from us on that so we're working through that issue and uh been professional in the way they're handling it so uh we're hopeful to work through those issues uh and get some understanding uh also since our last meeting uh the uh epta held its annual Mobility conference uh in Portland Oregon hosted by trit who did a great job uh with not only the conference but uh the rodeo uh also was held and uh our maintenance Rodeo team did an outstanding job uh representing chariots in the competition and all the events they they represented uh chariots very well uh during the whole weekend of that activity so I'd like to uh recognize our participants uh from the maintenance team was uh France benike uh Jason Cam and Ken Craig and their coach uh was uh vehicle maintenance supervisor Dean kid so uh we're were able to watch a good chunk of their competition and uh they did great especially when you consider some of the other agencies have been sending teams for for years this was the first time all three of them competed so uh uh they had a great time uh and we're thankful to be participants uh also uh we've talked a little bit about but uh just want to remind you next Thursday May 30th is Employee Appreciation day we'll be taking time off to recognize and acknowledge all of our employees uh for the work that they do on behalf of Chariots and the community as well as as uh begin the uh uh distribution of service Safety and safe driving Awards to those recipients uh it's next Thursday as I said at Del Web from 12:00 to 3: if your schedule allows please stop by any time during that it's a coming come is as your schedule allows event but uh staff will be there for the the full time uh and then earlier today I did receive uh the first agenda for the joint committee on transportation's uh uh 2025 Transportation package Road Show which is going to be held June 4th in Portland uh so we do have the agenda I do plan on attending uh to uh kind of watch the process go they're going to start with some tours then they'll have a community Round Table of invited participants and then public comment um and I'll be going to that because we are one of the other agencies that three or four other locations where",

        "text": "20 contingency and again contingency is designed because we don't know what's going to happen in the future but we believe that our estimate which is the the decommissioning costs themselves has a sufficient contingency on top of it and effectively what happened as we went back and forth on this was an additional six almost seven million dollars of contingency was added to our decommissioning estimate um and you know that is going to sit in an lc or a letter of credit over the course of 30 years and adds a lot of cost to the project and we don't necessarily think that it's it you know the arbitrary 10 percent or 20 is is justified we believe you know our experts who are you know well versed in decommissioning that that their amount should stand on their own and so we just wanted to put that into the record we believe that the the amount as presented by capital power which is still in the 30 million dollar range um i think it might have been 32 million range is sufficient but once you add an additional six to seven million dollars and it's almost 39 million that it really compo compounds itself over time and and to have a letter of credit whether it's 32 or 39 sitting in the bank we do think the state is like fairly protected because at the end of the day capital power publicly traded company large balance sheet we're going to be able to stand behind and take down this facility when it comes time but the seven million dollars compounded over time adds like many millions of dollars unnecessarily so we just wanted to put that in the record any questions i don't have my video on i guess i need to put my video on yeah yeah hold on just one second cindy condon and i have a question so um in the just with respect to that especially the decommissioning and the could you explain a little bit about the hierarchy capital power versus nolan hills yep um nolan hills is the applicant i understand it and capital but everything refers to capital power and we're depending on your balance sheet and your financials but nolan hills remains the applicant of record right correct so could you explain how to um to be comfortable with the balance sheet having that balance sheet and your standing depending on yeah so um we we acquired a company called element power which is base was basically in portland oregon we we acquired that llc which nolan hills was a part of and we've kept that structure in place but at the end of the day um capital power uh we actually have a um parent company in canada capital power corporation and we also have a holding company in the us that's called capital power us holdings and so capital power corporation is the rated entity everything flows back up the chain to capital power which is the publicly traded company that has you know lots of shareholders it's it's the project that's on the toronto stock exchange it's what s p rates in terms of financial capability and so nolan hills wind llc is a subsidiary of capital power and so anytime we put a bond in place or a letter of credit in place whether if it's in canada it's from capital power corporation if it's in the u.s it's from our u.s holding company that's what the letter of credit is going like when we put a 32 million or 39 million dollar letter of credit in place it's going to be capital power holdings as our as the entity that is standing behind that and that's because that's the company that has the wherewithal to to pay 32 million dollars when it comes time and so it is a it's a fully owned subsidiary we believe that that's ultimately who will stand behind the project i don't know does that answer your um but in the in the there's certainly no guarantee that or there's nothing that says that i have read that um says capital power stands behind stands behind nolan hills and i just want to get comfortable with that that that's a firm statement on your part that capital power is really the entity correct capital power is the entity that's who i work for that's who will ultimately fund this project and you know when this project is obtaining revenues and and paying the bills it'll all run through capital power and so the capital power itself has been around for a long long time we were the municipally owned utility in edmonton it's been around since 1896 and so we're very confident we'll be around when it comes time to decommission this thank you okay great any other questions from council before we move on um are we then ready to move on to public comment all right so as i indicated earlier we're going to start with public comment from participants who are in person in pendleton there and um i think we have seven people who are gonna comment as i mentioned you'll have five minutes a piece don't feel like you need to use all five minutes if you don't want to but that's kind of our the limit kathleen whenever you're ready if you want to have the first person come up and introduce themselves thank you for the record this is sloane um i just want to check the room i know a couple of people came in after we got started to see if there was anybody who hasn't given me a comment card that wants to comment okay so i believe we have eight eight okay so the first i'm going to call on is mr chuck little my name is chuck little the spelling is i live at 17 west view drive hermeson i'm here today in support of the nolan hills wind project the nolan hills winch project is going to be one of the few renewable green energy projects in oregon that'll have wind solar battery storage from the beginning of the permitting process the 300 megawatt wind energy components comprised of 12 wind turbine generators make the bulk of the project the megawatt solar array will include eight hundred and sixteen thousand eight hundred and twelve solar modules and battery storage system will be approximately 120 megawatts battery this part this part could cover up to 18 96 acres or 2.96 square miles depending on the final technology and later layout selected for the project this portion of the project will be enclosed with a foot tall security fence projects like this need to be moved forward to meet the supply of renewable energy in oregon with the passage of senate bill 1547 in 2016 that mandates that 50 of oregon's electrical needs be provided by renewable sources by 2040. i'm urging the oregon energy siding council to approve this project so that work can move forward in its clean energy mandates um also a few comments that i've heard i know the asset council does a very good job of ruling reviewing these application and i think they will be sure that any concerns raised in any of these meetings will be hashed out before certificate is issued so thank you very much and have a good day thank you mr little are there any questions uh for mr little i'm not hearing any we can go ahead and move on to the next person okay the next person is mr james peters good evening good evening members council thank you for letting me speak this evening my name is james peters it's j-a-m-e-s-p-e-t-e-r-s i'm a member of labor's local 737 i'm in support of the nolan hills wind projects because i've worked a few renewable projects in oregon i believe they are a win-win for oregon we can harness green energy and we also provide money back into our communities by creating good paying jobs for oregon thank you thank you mr peters can you um provide either your email or your address yeah uh jay peters at leona all right thank you he also provided his address on the testimony okay my apologies no that's fine i just wanted you to know that okay who's next mr eric i believe it's anson oh you said no okay okay he submitted written comment should i read them or should i go all right i have another one okay uh jody parker okay all right so you didn't take a swing at that middle name there oh well that would be my handwriting well welcome to pendleton uh chair grill vice chair how council members good afternoon again welcome it's been quite a long time since we've been able to sit in council like this isn't it how exciting is this so thank you for taking the time to be out here and to listen to my testimony i am jody goetzlo parker i'm a business rep with laborers international union of north america local 737 we represent roughly 3 000 men and women in the state of oregon who work as construction craft we work as a voice for our members across the state ensuring that we have fair and equitable labor agreements the best education through our training centers as possible in apprenticeship opportunities for diverse communities one of our state strengths is our commitment to investments in green energy or the renewables through wind solar multimodal transportation options and biofuels to just to name a few i feel that our great state leads the pack with innovations to ensure we grow to a healthier place as we move forward to our future the opportunities that a project like this will build our region both economically and by providing a training source for careers that are successful and fulfilling as it's known the nolan hills wind power project will be good for oregon's renewable infrastructure the economy and put oregon's oregonians back to work nolan hills wind power project should go through a careful review by our professional regulators to ensure compliance with their existing laws however we should never put up roadblocks to other hundreds of middle class jobs and financial support that this kind of energy will bring to this project will provide important short and long term boost to our regional economic economy the proposals will create jobs in transportation and trades in both the blue collar and the white collar workers just as important the projects like this strengthen our tax bases for our local economies and that have been hit so hard by this recent pandemic and thank everybody for coming through this we are seeing signs of life in our urban areas but our rural areas the impact clearly still lingers the projects and jobs create new revenues for our schools and other vital there was a time quite a long time ago years ago that we lacked our knowledge the technology the tough environmental laws and procedures to achieve both a strong economy",

        "text": " at least in the policy discussion that comes out and I just included some of the thing we've heard a lot more than this actually but but some of the things we've heard so far you know there's the tension between um development and land conservation um there's you know what do we do with um industrial zoned areas um when we're reading developing them there's there's a lot of discussion about um Urban growth boundaries for housing versus um solar sighting um we're paying very close attention to the land conservation and development commission's uh solar sighting um rules advisory committee and kind of the discussions and how they're unfolding there um and we've also heard a bit about Agra full take so this is really just a flavor and just to say that we're we're just at the start of the conversation um so we we're um we'll be talking about ways to engage shortly in this presentation so if we go to the slide um there are also some things and and this is really the list of things that's difficult to model in that Central model but we still want to include some technical analysis so um one thing that we'll be doing is thinking about um household budgets and so the energy wallet the idea of this concept is really to look at the household budget across different um types of energy that we pay for they they tend to be separate bills but it's important to look at them um together particularly when when you think about somebody buying an electric vehicle um that's kind of the easy example because you're not paying for gasoline but now your electricity consumption goes up and your electric bill is going to go up but the other bill is going down and so we want to make sure that when we're thinking about things like Michael mentioned energy burden that we understand what that picture really looks like and it won't be the same for every household so we want to do some differentiation and this will be one of the ch Alles in the working groups too and how we develop some representative um kind of customer groups it you know there there will be too many to include um everyone but we will try to be as inclusive as possible so that we can provide some useful information for makers um we'll also be looking at Health impacts so there's a there's a tool called the the envir the US Environmental Protection agency's cobra model it essentially looks at um air quality and health and the link between the two so uh we can learn about what happens to um air quality and what the impact is on public health when we um reduce uh internal combustion engine vehicles on roads or reduce biomass combustion things like that that would produce pollutants that this model can measure so we'll be looking at that um and we're also considering how um how to how to consider the geographic differences um and the kind of different economic and other differences across the state if we look um even by county for example so we haven't figured out how exactly we're going to do this it's another area that we're going to engage with folks about but um but but we we kind of recognize that this is really important that we need to consider the difference differences across Oregon so we'll be doing that and we'll also be looking at things like Community benefits um so kind of building on on existing discussions in Oregon it's not just about cost it's also about the the benefits that can come from some of these measures so one example is um you know uh uh there are co- benefits in terms of resilience of things like weatherization um PV panels and batteries right so kind of thinking through those things and how they can um benefit communities and then we'll also be looking a bit at um the economic and employment impacts of different uh Pathways if we go to the next slide um so I just want to emphasize something that Michael mentioned which is that we're we're not we're not just making things up here we are starting we're grounding the analysis and existing policy in existing uh utility integrated resource plans and clean energy plans uh CPP compliance plans where reviewing uh Oregon energy policies with other agencies to make sure that we're fully aligned and that we're taking into account everything that's in place today um and we're also reviewing recent studies that have happened that provide data and information that we should be taking into account and uh you saw that map of the region so we're we're also reviewing Regional plans like the Northwest power and conservation Council um they they'll be kind of still in the relatively early stages of developing the next power plan but there's a lot of work going into it so we're in touch with them on that um and and we're also going to to um consider the regional efforts that are happening there's a lot happening right now on on electricity markets on resource adequacy on transmission so all of that um we're aware of it we're taking it into account and we're making sure that we're not contradicting anything that's already been decided that's in place that we're we're considering that our starting point um so if we go to the next slide um so next we're going to talk a little bit about engagement opportunity so I just wanted to pause to see if there are any questions on uh the what we've presented so far on the kind of the modeling and the technical analysis um Mr any questions councelor delin yeah thank you Mr chairman um probably somewhat more of a comment than a question uh Mr chairman I could spend about the next 12 hours discussing this but I'll use just about two minutes um as the speaker may know I spent four years on the northwest power and conservation Council which I won't go into now why it was created and and what its uh role is in terms of long-term planning uh for the four states of U Oregon Washington Montana and Idaho but just a couple of comments one is that uh I would just encourage that you look as far beyond our borders as possible in terms of impacts and perhaps in terms of opportunities also uh because sometimes States tend to really stop their discussions at their borders and I know you're not talking about that but this is an area which you really can't do that uh one of the areas that wasn't discussed as a resource and uh at the other Council what we constantly discuss and is the importance of conservation you've uh briefly describe that but in in a sense uh our power needs in the region would be much greater if it wasn't for the uh significant uh uh conservation efforts that we've had over the last several decades uh much different and we're much better off uh it's one of the reasons the hydr power and the conservation that clearly makes it possible even under what we would believe our probable scenarios are um to totally decarbonize the uh um the electric uh Electric provision in the region um by the years required by various uh States um the other thing is um I would hope you'd look at um you mentioned this briefly but uh part of it is not just how many transmission facilities or or resources we have but how they're managed and there are some significant questions about how are existed transmission resources are managed also there's significant questions about how our uh our production resources are managed um I think the other thing here is that um um it's a very hard area to to plan out I mean the the the Northwest power council is a 20year scenario focusing on six years um it's a very hard area to plan out particularly given changes in technology and the last thing I would state is that uh as far ahead as we are on the electricity side that you know impacts uh three out of those four sectors directly unfortunately doesn't seem to impact the transportation sector that much yet we are way behind on the decarbonization efforts in the transportation sector those the remedy to that may not be all electric there may be other Technologies but we are so far behind uh that uh it would take an enormous effort both on a state region and National level to get anywhere close to our objectives yeah I was noticing here 3% in transportation for electricity uh in particular thank you um those are those are all excellent points and I'll just I'll just respond to them very briefly one is that um 100% agreed on conservation and uh we will be look taking a very hard look at it and I'll actually expand that and say we'll be taking a very um hard look to the extent that we can within this model at the demand side because those electric vehicles that um that might be putting a lot of strain on the system actually have batteries in them that can also provide a really big resource for for in uh integrating Renewables into the power system so I think there's a lot when we look out to a 2050 time frame that that needs to be worked out and the demand side is a very very important part of that um I uh also also agree the looking looking Beyond borders I know for example in that in that map that Canada isn't included um but it it we are we are considering Canada it is part of the western interconnection so there's there's a bit of a limitation on that map that we probably just need to fix so we don't create the wrong idea in Texas as well and yeah yeah right yeah that's right there's a there's part of Texas as um uh the the transmission piece and how transmission is managed and how production resources are managed I think that uh some of that might be incorporated into the model but I think a lot of that will be more in the policy recommendations discussion and that's a very important one um the it is really difficult to plan out to 2050 and we recognize that and we'll we'll do the best that we can just like anybody who's doing a really long-term term Outlook I'll just emphasize that this isn't a plan it's a strategy and so it's supposed to give us some strategic Direction and I think that in terms of policy recommendations they're more likely to focus on the nearer term while giving that perspective that enriching a bit our perspective on on kind of long-term trade-offs and options more than anything um and uh yeah Transportation lots to do and it's not just about electrification there's a lot more in there this ccor byon back to the regional piece the first graphic the noodle graphic um with the amount of coal coming into the region still I had no clue so you know and and I think about energy a lot but I forgot that there was still that much coal on the grid in the western area um on conservation um which we've been talking about since the 70s I think and then there was a boom in the early ",

        "text": " the road to frame up what a project looks like and also to potentially identify some some future leaders from those that aren't right now engaged in this conversation if odo staff might be in a position to to help deliver something like that it's a really great idea and it could really potentially make our outreach efforts a lot more successful and targeted if we have kind of that survey um the benefit of of hearing these voices coming directly from the communities so i think it's a great idea and we ought to think about that as we the sort of outreach and community support aspects of the program um that's all thank you thank you shannon um i see several hands up here and we've also had a member of the public raise their hand i don't know if we have any hands that have been up for a while if there's any committee members that have had their hand up for a while and want to just jump in now i don't want to neglect you and i think we will bring in a a public question now because we've got one from one of our i could just jump in um shannon definitely just mentioned one of the things that i was going to say having and i'm coming at this not so much from the utility perspective definitely but having been on the side of representing organizations trying to go after grants and um one of the things that i would say is you're finding more and more that we and learn we especially if you're if you're doing this enough you know the types of things that you need to present so surveys and constantly being engaged groups that you're serving is something that you're you understand it that's a part of what you need to do more and more and bringing those voices in um but for organizations that are not necessarily used to doing that i definitely believe giving them some type of survey templates where they can reach out to their communities would be i would say when you're thinking about things and that you can just easily say to a group like provide us feedback provide us information that shows how you've done this in the past when we submit grants we pull together all the stuff that we've done over the years and we start to go through what's most relevant where do we have good feedback what's what's um still where do we need to go back and actually have some communications with the communities we serve and bring that voice in and make it stronger i i just and you can look at an leadership and their makeup to see if you if you see voices represented appropriately in the community you know i think there's some really simple things that know that they can respond to because you have so many different grants that are out there and focus around environmental justice that you know i think you're going to find that organizations that are used to that are going to yes it's timely and there's limited capacity but they they they're already doing a lot of these things and i would just kind of say that just because an organization may not necessarily qualify for this 50 doesn't mean that they won't qualify for the other 50 of the funding so um that's just something else to keep in mind as we're going through this really good point and i i apologize if i've lost the threat on whose hand was up first and i propose that we go to brandy and then phil and then to alex ruiz who has his hand up as a public participant as an attendee and so it will will go in that order you can skip me i forgot to put my hand down oh all right phil oh all right alex um think am i able to unmute alex oh can you hear me hi good afternoon everyone this is alex over at uec thank you for all of your efforts really appreciate you everything you do one of the one i've seen an example where uh for the community and environmental justice engagement uh the way uh i've seen uh some other parts of the country do it is um and score it is uh you know they had a score matrix um and they assigned a higher preference to a community that had a formal agreement with a municipality or a housing affordable housing provider or some local community organization had a formal agreement that said they were willing to commit and collaborate on this type of project and then they assigned a lower preference number to uh just uh an organization that decided to get some kind of consultation but weren't really really uh committed to an ongoing uh grant writing it's more of a hey we like this idea we're willing to to do it but we just need you to consult us and let us know if it's best and best for our and then um they gave no points to uh to uh an applicant who had no collaboration um you couldn't reach anyone in the community and they got no points so that's one example that i've seen and just wanted to share that with you all yeah thanks for sharing that and also thanks for bringing the discussion nicely back around to focusing on something that can actually be established in rules so yeah that's um ultimately that's what we're kind of looking for here is how we develop this scoring matrix and how we take these challenging components of benefits to and participation by these environmental justice communities and actually apply them to a something as administratively dull as a as a scoring matrix but that's what we are aiming for here so thanks alex for chiming in and um sharing that and kind of bringing us back around so i don't know if there's any other thoughts on this one and i may also just throw it to ruchi or wendy within our staff to see if we're feeling like um it's a good time to move on if we have no other comments they can maybe step to the next any thoughts so let's go to the next question thanks for all of that um discussion and feedback so here we get to kind of this um the administrative burden and the capacity within communities to to put together these grant applications and i put two questions on this slide because they're they're quite related and the first is should applicants be responsible for demonstrating their status as a qualifying or ej community and if so what specific evidence can be and then the alternate question to that or the the kind of follow-up is if applicants are required to demonstrate their status as an ej are there tools available to help demonstrate qualification are these tools accessible to smaller communities with limited staff to develop grant application our ej screen and us census analysis good tools for the program to use so this is getting at kind of how how an applicant is going to be working with the community to make these to demonstrate these claims and naming a couple of specific tools i know that we also heard opportunity zones i think mark mentioned those where there's already sort of a you know definition or zone that is being used within oregon that demonstrates a low income status and so i think i'll throw this out to the committee and see if there's thoughts i know we've touched on pieces of this but specifically around this demonstration and what specific piece of evidence can communities provide and if it's a tool is it the right tool and as we ponder this one i think i will jump ahead to this next question as well because it's also related should oto develop a standardized process for applicants to demonstrate qualifications and so this is where something like that opportunity zone if we can offer up very elements that can be demonstrated on an maybe we can do some of that work up front to make it easier for communities those three questions and get to this you know how do you demonstrate it so brandy i i had a question i wanted to ask more food for thought but hopefully not complicated the process i know with the pandemic the number of people that are eligible for a lie heap for instance has just gone to the root so a lot of the low income measures that we might have looked at typically um have changed right when people have lost their jobs during the pandemic or for other variety of circumstance uh so i guess my question or thought would be the group is if this is looking at certain measurements is there going to be a time frame is it going to encompass kind of the pandemic and all the impacts and the effects it has on people um or is it going to go back and look at some of those other figures and have something like within the past three years or some other conditions like that that's a really good question and you know things have changed so much so quickly that tools like ej screen and us census analysis may not really get to the specific needs that have arisen in some communities so yeah that's a that's a good question while people are thinking i'll also just add that some of these questions we're looking at internally at the department of energy um evaluating um the ej screen and other tools that are out there right this is the white house initiative with justice 40. so we're looking at tools and potentially developing our own tools if we set up that collaborative website or i'll send it during email anytime we evaluate things or find things happy to pass it along to this group i think we'll we'll see more and more um being released in the future and you know it it this these questions kind of bring up a way of thinking about this you know going beyond the rules if you think about what an application might look like and are we able to develop some check boxes that a community can check at that application phase and you know the rules can say that you know the the application will do this or that but within that application phase if there's you know if there's a check box for are you in an opportunity zone that is really quick and easy um or are you you know maybe there's some other designation and if we think of this in terms of check boxes for communities to kind of take a shortcut in the grant application maybe that's one way to look at this um ariana i think brandy was ahead of me oh thank you i i think that you just took her hand and so ariana and then quinn and again sorry if i missed the order up so i think because opportunity zones have come up a couple times now it's just worth naming that opportunity zones are a complicated issue in particular for indigenous black and brown communities and in particular lower income communities who are likely to be uh by investments that have been historically tied to opportunity zones i think there are ways to leverage some of the tax credits but i think if we want to use an opportunity zone as a of need from a community it would feel better at least from my",

        "text": " here because you are stopping something before it happen, because after you approve, there is nothing they can do. And that fight here is amazing. I want to ask you the favor. I know you mentioned the moratorium. Can the residents write a moratorium, bring a proposal to you? I know it has been done around the country. Can they do it? So we are the ones who know we live by there, or close enough to hear the noise, or had problems with the traffic, with the legal. I see they had even legal. They had attorneys here. Can the moratorium be proposed? We cannot wait until the owner of the property comes here, change the name of the project, or tweak something to make it look differently. Or until you do the standards. I can just go ahead and answer that for you. We're going to study fly in communities, and we will put some standards in place. And that is the process. Can you put a moratorium yourselves on? You can go buy that property if you want, and then you can control that property yourself. No, it's different type of moratoriums, when the residents are the city or the counties, and they can get something to be done to stop certain processes. In this case, this new standard that you plan to work with for the flying communities, will the residents be allowed to participate in any way? Whenever we make that final adoption, there will be at least two hearings. It'll come before us, so it will be publicly advertised, and citizens can come in and give their input whenever those policies take place, before it ever gets finally approved by this board. Okay, I want to close with. Thank you. I'm sorry, I want to close with this. Remember that hangers mean more planes, more planes mean more noise. More noise mean more air contamination. The same one that the government claims to protect from air pollution and the congestion. Thank you. And we're very pleased that you chose Marion county. Yes, sir. Mister Minter, do you have a follow up? Yeah, I can just make a couple of observations. The whole idea of, you know, this word moratorium is like a lightning rod word as far as legal issues are concerned. I mentioned a doctrine called zoning in progress, and that's been recognized by some Florida courts. The idea being that while you're working on a zoning ordinance, you can withhold permits, but, you know, we'll have to check legally to make sure we cross our t's and dot our I's on that. What I'm contemplating, I think what the board has in mind is not specific to this particular property. We're looking into our land development code for the whole county on this issue. Correct. And what we're talking about is limited to this airpark issue, not some broad moratorium of any development in the county, notwithstanding Mister Heath desire to do that. So. But that's. That was my focus of my comments. Yes, sir, you were very clear when you brought that forward earlier, and you're right, it morphed off into that. Right. Okay, thank you. Yes, ma'am. Brenda Oswald, 720 northeast 95th street. I live on the north end of the airport. Thank you, Miss Oswald. We bought our property back 52 years ago. I'm one of the oldest residents there and we bought it for the acreage there for our animals, for the peace of life, the lifestyle it could give us. We can't even sit out on the patio now and have a nice quiet family meal on Sunday afternoon without the helicopters flying over very low. You can see them sitting there in the door like they trying to entertain us. We don't need that kind of entertainment. We just need our peace and quiet and the quality of life that we purchased our property for. I have three generations living there. We wanted to raise our children, our grandchildren and our great grandchildren there. And I know they've mentioned the traffic, but we have traffic coming off of 441 that you all may not be aware of. Not just regular cars and trucks, but semis. I have called the county on it to have them look at it. They come down these little two lane highways, 95th street and West Anthony Road. The mileage, the speed limits are 35 and 40 miles an hour with double yellow lines. No one pays attention to that. It's hard for me to get back into my driveway in the afternoon, bringing the children home. We don't let them ride the bus anymore or walk to the school. I go along and pick up neighborhood children waiting on the buses or walking to school. They are in danger of this traffic. The speed limits. 60, 70, 80 miles an hour. Just several weeks ago, we had a gentleman eat up about 15 yards of fencing. He died in two weeks time. On 326, we had four wrecks, not just bump ups. You can look back, I have pictures of them. It's already out of hand. This small community. We can't handle all this traffic on ground and in the air. They're trying to take everything away from us. I'm at an age and time in my life. I don't want to have to sell my property and look elsewhere. This was for our lifetime. And I'm just asking when this comes back again I would like to challenge each and every one of you to come out. You're welcome to come to my place. Not just ride out and say, oh, it looks nice. It's quiet. No. When you live there 24 hours a day, it's a big difference. It's a lot to see. Thank you. Thank you mister. Donnelly. Brian Donnelly. 7337 West Anthony Road, Acala, Florida. 35 years ago my flight instructors told me I'll be right back. And he never came back. He went up into a twin engine plane with a student and on final approach the engine failed. The plane went past knife edge and he corkscrewed right into the ground. It is what made me take up aerobatics. I have done all the flybys, done all the air shows, done all the joyrides. I can tell you what is going on at Jumbalaya right now. The man is never going to grow old. There's an old saying in aviation. There's no such thing as an old and bold pilot. I hope Mister Bull grows old and I hope he stops being so bold. About two and a half months ago I sent Mister Weyrich and this board a proposal, an 18 page proposal for a private overlay district. I studied what was going on in Florida. I went through each county and I culled out all of the information and put it together with references so this county could put in place a private overlay airport district. I was told, give us $6,000, give me three years and hopefully we can get this done. I can't tell you how happy I am today to come before you and hear that this body will finally take this issue up. There are 20 private airports in this county. They're unregulated. We have a problem in our community, but this county has a problem almost everywhere when it comes to private aviation. I understand that you want to set up and study all of this for a period of time. I know that the attorneys are invited. I would like to see a member of our neighborhood be part of such a study so that we can contribute accordingly to benefit the community as a whole. Thank you. Thank you Mister Donnelly. Hi, this is Christina Larson again. 9349 West Anthony Road, Ocala, Florida 34479. I have lived here. This is my 6th year here now and I live in the farmland preservation or protection Area, FPA. I am exactly 17 30ft away from the northern part of Jamboler, according to the FAA that I have communicated with. And I have a ten acre horse farm. I have five horses there now. And like other people I moved here for the beauty and the equestrian lifestyle, the horse capital of the world. I also was happy when the World Equestrian center was completed because that helped my property value by not me doing much. And I have shown at WEC and I was actually planning on doing that again season. And I have tried to recruit trainers to come to my place. And the helicopters were talking, military helicopters, Apaches, blackhawks and hueys. I didn't even know the difference between those before and the way they are flying, how low they are flying. I'm totally unaware when they are coming because these planes have a special side agreement with the FAA of that I think they're called experimental, that they don't have to have the ATSB tracking devices. There is a software on my phone where I can see, okay, I'm going to try to ride now which planes are nearby. And then I hear and I'm like, ah, it's not working. What's wrong with my phone? They are not trackable so I cannot prepare myself. I have to then take the horse back and wait my time. But I never know when I'm safe. They have actually once when I was riding, looking like a paranoid person, person, you know, because I am on high alert, okay, it's very dangerous to ride and jump to start with and you are concentrating, but then having helicopters, in plural, coming two at a time. Once they were over me four times and I'm like, is this a coincidence or is this harassment, you know, or do they think that my horse is extra pretty? What is this? You know, and the Hueys, I guess are the loudest ones. They have a special sound, which I'm not",

members and uh those in the public that are joining us for our meeting today um we will take the roll call after a few uh introductory um remarks and um then we'll also provide an opportunity for commission members to provide any brief updates they might want to provide after the Roll Call one thing I wanted to acknowledge up front is that um Zach and I have been talking about ways that we can kind of improve how we manage public comments um we get a combination of requests and comments through two different channels uh currently that are set up and that makes it a little hard to track and to make sure that we're kind of getting the comments that people want in front of the commission separated from the requests that come in for us to respond to in between meetings and so we did I think Zach we've posted the comments now but just did that this morning and they were not distributed to the Commission in advance none of the comments were directed to agenda items today and most most of them were requests for information and uh from staff in the commission so we we will resolve the challenges that we've had or come up with a better approach for making sure we're being as responsive to the public as we can be before our next meeting we will have time for public comment uh in today's meeting and that's estimated to to occur around 2 30 and uh Zach and Stacy I don't know how many people we currently have on from the public to know if we should uh postpone uh having you do the kind of this is how we will manage the public comments or maybe wait until a little later in the process to do that um do you have a recommendation on that sac it looks like we have a fair amount of folks so I think we should just great um well then if you will just remind people how they can let us know that they want to provide testimony during the meeting depending on how many people want to testify we will ask people to confine their comments to either one or three and uh also on the public to know if for some reason we can't get to all the comments which usually we're able to do but just in case you are welcome to send us your testimony after the meeting and we'll distribute that to commission so with that I'll turn it over to Zach you and Stacy to remind people how to do that sure thanks Sarah McDonald um so just as uh my interface is a little different because I'm sharing my screen but I believe um there is a smiley face emoji at the bottom of the screen for folks from the public and if you uh click on that or near that you should be able to then see a hand icon that can let us know that you would like to speak during public comment and then um once we see that you're interested in speaking uh we'll call on you and there will be an unmute notification that comes to you that you can then um be able to speak and then we'll put you back on meet after you offer your and just a quick reminder before we go to the roll call it can be challenging to monitor hands from Commissioners when they're raised to be able to provide comments or ask questions so if I don't call on you or Zach and I don't see your hand please do feel free to mute yourself and chime in um with your question or comment in this format we don't it doesn't put the person who just raised their hand up at the front uh at least doesn't seem to when I'm tracking it so um I just wanted to flag that

me um Judith Collins who's representing uh Oda today thank you Judith so with that are there are there any commission members who'd like to provide a brief update on some work that's pertinent to the commission I'll um just take the opportunity to flag for folks that we are the Oregon Department of energy this week is hosting two open houses to inform the design of a grid resilience program that we are um going to be receiving federal funds um soon this summer and we've submitted an application to the US Department of energy for these funds and now we are working to put the details on um what the program will look like so we have an open house in Western Oregon at our Salem office on Tuesday and in eastern well not really in eastern Oregon middle Oregon at Warm Springs on Wednesday and there are virtual options for both so I will put um something in the chat for people to see in case you are interested in that topic and don't have that on your excellent thank you director Banner um Christian Sharon uh yes hi uh chair I just thought I would report that I think since the our last meeting um as a commission Portland General Electric filed its combined clean energy plan and integrated resource plan with the Oregon Public Utility Commission um at the very end of March we are now in an open public comment period and will be in um uh a series of public comment periods over the next uh six plus months as we continue to refine that analysis it is our roadmap for how we not only meet our long-term energy and capacity needs for PG E's pge's customers but also how we do so um with the emissions reduction requirements that were set forth in house bill 2021. excellent thank you just looking to see if there are any hands up don't see any so with that I think we can go to our maybe just look at our overall agenda and then go to our first agenda item oh Kathy commissioner Reitman I have my hand up sorry I didn't see that commissioner yes the just to remind her that the Senate bill 530 the healthy soils bill is still alive I'm not sure if the legislature is still alive but we would like to see that one continue its progress yeah I believe it's uh um Senate bill 530 is the natural and working lands Bill and um thank you for your engagement in advocating on behalf of that bill um in your personal capacity commissioner Reedman I appreciate that I think there is also a healthy soils bill which is also still alive which but separate from the right yeah 5 30. uh Gabriella yeah thank you chair McDonald I just wanted to mention for folks that the 2021 session enacted the healthy homes grant program and uh which uh and providing 10 million dollars and then the 2022 legislature added another uh five million dollars so a total of 15 million dollars and many of the agencies um on the global warming commission have been helping us with that we're in rule making right now with a hope to be able to issue a notice of Grant award at the end of the summer and be issuing grants by the end of the year we see this as an important Pathway to leverage use State funds which are flexible to complement uh the resources that are coming in from the federal government and you know existing and new uh to really both Advance clean uh energy healthy homes and Achieve housing retention goals and so just wanted to flag that the rulemaking is open right now and we're collecting the rules themselves are going to be very generic to try to be adaptable to different situations and most of the requirements that we issue will be in the request for Grant proposals that's how we're going to shape things so we're doing a lot of capturing of issues that will be important to make these efforts roll out well so if there are folks who want I'll put in the chat a link to the rulemaking that has the remaining meetings the meetings will be going into July so folks aren't aware of it it's an opportunity to come and and raise additional important ways that OHA should be informed as we roll these out that's great all of those updates are really important parts of implementing the roadmap so great to hear all of that work that's underway all right thanks okay let me just make sure no one else wants to raise a hand then let's take a quick look at the agenda today we're going to get a legislative update from Christy split at Odo and uh we're going to do a deeper dive and at our next meeting after the the legislature um ends for the session the session um but today I wanted to just highlight and provide some information on context for how we see the rest of the some of the legislation that we're paying close attention to but we'll do a deeper dive at our next meeting on what the overall results were and then we'll talk hear a presentation from Colin McConaughey and Janine director Benner on the climate pollution reduction that the state developed to submit to EPA to secure funding which is also going to be very helpful in taking next steps on kind of deepening and advancing a lot of the elements in the roadmap we have done brief presentations on the natural and working lands work that's been happening kind of a little bit separately but under the auspices of the commission and we'll be hearing from uh Lisa",

        "text": " not acceptable for us and so it has to be backed by a out of security of some kind correct okay thank okay Bob Bronson all this body here that bring a little background I wasn't going to say anything because I might be one of the people on this I'm currently screwing on as chairman of the playmation I've been chairman for probably four years I serve at the pleasure that people County Accident Commissioners I also serve on the Harrisburg rural fire and rescue District as of our board meeting Thursday night of this week the only reason we knew about this is because I've been collecting notes on it nobody's going to hurt my interest that fast I would certainly know about can you lean into the mic a little bit okay is that better okay that's that uh because we have to be prepared for it and you know for what type of uh materials on hand and emergency response coordinating with that and so I'm certain that's and the purpose of this whole hearing is addressing subjects like that oh some Podium that notify them you know I sat in your position I've run a lot of hearings over the years and being able to a lot of times people say well this is the final thing no it's bringing the information it's very important to listen to what these people here say and their concerns because they live in there I live in Harrisburg I've been there for since 1970 my family's been there since 1916 and we came out longer than that so I'm deeply ingrained the people in this room I don't know how many of them in my I and I spent 20 years as a grass seed farmer running sheep so I'm quite familiar with a lot of subject matters and I had to take another 28 years in the insurance business to recover or from my farming experience and a lot of you can understand that and so I feel very comfortable with the people here because a lot of folks here have been clients online I know them quite their families and what they're but what they're concerned about is dealing with things we had a 10 acre parcel and I think you're a primary one over the last fall I think it was the solar panel did you look up at that one went through the county well you should it's out by Highway 20 on it and that was limited because of the condition now some of the things we put in there as conditions of it that you had to be dealing with drainage your runoff and storm water runoff the effect on it facing a path and stuff from other neighbors and there's no mentioned up here but uh thanks for me well she got mowing into things I mean I said you use a sheep operation you set for it but you're gonna have to mold and control weeds particularly noxious Foods because it doesn't smoke and grow wild all over there all everyone here will agree with me on that so those things when you're putting your plan together and says for example using livestock for vegetation control or you may use use something else but you can't at this stage in the game you can't sit down we're going to do XYZ you know the energy sighting Council has a real difficult job my youngest son is in the power of the game he builds fire lines transmission Alliance and the Ugly Truth is people are saying that uh and he works for the big stuff the 300 the 500 KW stuff and when he told me about four years ago he said Dad we're gonna make a lot of people unhappy and so what's going to do and we're going to dump the Grid in parts of I said how much notice they're going to get 30 minutes notice they insist that no more fires be started by uh Santa Ana and I called him up a couple days so how's it going he says well I'm sitting in a hotel room eating a can of cold chili it affected me because this trailer was another area because we have the growth and stuff here and that's part of the thing is the planning and citing and looking at is what we're dealing with people's property but also we're dealing with something that we can't argue away that's the laws of physic you can only shove so much energy through a wire so far when people talk about where it is at we have people in this Northwest that want to pull dams out and they don't have an alternative and you know and if you as all individual citizens will let us know the craziness that is because I don't want to be here or my children growing up grandchildren now that in an area that we do not have is upon us sustainable power in one of the best hydroelectric areas there is you know these are things that we have advantages here and uh you know energy science citing Council I realize I you have a difficult job but my son is the one who works those lines I said well how long does it take you to get a new they figure bring a new transmission line in is a minimum 10 years is up are pretty close to the process it just rebuilt one into Seattle they took it up the power up and they put it in and took it 140 000 to 240 000 because a neighbor in the population nobody would expand that I can see why you want that power line out there because you've got a substation there on price row Road you got a line that carries it up you already ppnl already owns access as distribution things so it's a balancing and quality of life people's need for electricity responsible for the farm use and being able to get along with each other and uh and I can't encourage you to hold more meetings like this I would like to have something in the Harrisburg Area next time a little easier we have areas that are large enough for school to get people there but this is very important I know some people doubt it but we listen to people and when I run a hearing I make certain everybody has an opportunity to speak I will tell you if you get off the subject and go into often of the weeds I'm going to call you if I have to call you twice I'm going to ask you to sit down but I feel that it's been very Todd you've done a very good job of bringing out and reaching out to people because it's our communities it's our lives around here and we're looking for ourselves our children our grandchildren and how we put this together so uh I want people you know the resources I first saw this was a little bit about the County Commissioners I've been online looking it up and that's why I've kept up but like a lot of things you've got to do research yourself and particularly since we started coming up with solar farms in the area so uh I just uh give me a call and give a give you my business card you can always contact me down in Harrisburg and uh the uh try to disrespect each other and the neighbors because we do have to have the electricity in some way we got to generate it I questioned about the daylight but now you're efficiency in some of the things that new solar cells and I'm glad to hear is the U.S manufacturer that's building the panels uh and unfortunately some of the people making the decisions have no understanding of the manufacturing process and how long it takes now my son these big transformers you're looking two years out today to get one one goes out and you can't get it and uh we're we're running on the knife's edge you've probably heard this plenty of times Todd on our electrical grid system in the state and I don't want to be the points to get up my power says well you only have power for four hours a day and I want to avoid that we can do that by planning and putting things together but you have to have the people involved and have the desire and a political leadership to recognize that too thank you yeah I would uh I'll just like to comment I'm sorry that you didn't get notified from the city of um we the city yes I see yeah well apologies for not reaching out to you um I would love to continue conversations after this um if you don't mind giving me a business card after this yeah thank you but uh one thing to comment uh about fire like it is definitely a huge concern and in other parts of the United States when we have these projects it's actually um some fire departments actually see this as a positive just because we have stringent requirements within the fenced area you know having like a perimeter the panel set back from the fence by x amount not having any vegetation Etc a lot of places actually see these projects as fire breaks so if a solar project were to somehow actually catch on fire it would actually be self-contained because there are things like not just weed abatement that we do have to abide by and that's actually another comment that I really appreciate hearing from the from the public here because that's something again that I don't really know about so if sheep grazing is not something that can be do like be done throughout the entire year and there has to be a combination of sheep grazing and also mowing that is something that I'm hoping that would be uh hammered out when we have when we actually find a sheep Grazer and we actually sign a contract for them for operation maintenance of it um I would have to be relying on people who are subject matter experts to tell me what's actually needed um and those are little tidbits of information that are very valuable to me back on the record yeah that's critical because in your comment your conditions when you're set when you come back to these people in a future meeting said okay this is a plan we're gonna have somebody brings together working that we have a mowing crew in here because the fall and winter when we have the grass growing there is pasture out there but this time of year it's nothing but stubble and that becomes a fire hazard and you've got to control the thing with the mowing thank you so like I've been doing kind of all night I'm going to tie things back to our standards if I can and and one of the questions or points that got made I think ties back to one of our standards so one of our standards is the public services and we're required to evaluate all the potential impacts to Public Services 10 miles out from the facility you go back to that kind of Bullseye Public Services is 10 miles out so we look at the impacts to buy our water sewer police hospitals schools housing 10 miles out from the facility location so if",

        "text": " and more importantly I've gotten to know a lot of County government and the structure and how different they are and um and some of them even Rule and what we consider my definition of rural counties in Oregon has changed that some of them are actually just pioneers they're not even rural counties they're so I appreciated that I attended a lot of sessions I um mainly uh the transportation conversation that was really good to listen in electrifying our Fleet and cars at the local level was heavy on the and the the administration is really focused on that and and learned a lot like there's a lot of opportunities and fundings available on that and then um and the financial supports that are available the other thing I learned that was really interesting perspective was and now that tolling is happening I don't know how relevant this will be for us but it's something to consider is the the idea of the impact you know examining the impacts of heavy trucks on low bridges now that tolling is going to be implemented how many trucks are going to be rerouted or will try to avoid use some of the local Bridges and obviously the presenter of that conversation really was sort of in a way helping people experience this near-death experience while through pictures so they showed a lot of horrible pictures of bridges collapsing while a truck is crossing and and Neighbors coming out and even some of them showing that there are people standing while the truck was going over the bridge so that was an interesting learning to figure out uh once tolling is up how many bridges are really capable of you know so that was um and just to be continued conversation obviously something that um some of the flyers I took it's more relevant probably the tolling conversation so I didn't but I could share that with you Stephen um and then obviously planning and partnering uh sort of like deploying electric vehicle infrastructure at the local level that was really appealing conversation for me and I've connected a couple people that I want to follow up and see what they're doing over there um just to learn and that we've heard a lot of updates on the um and one thing I I can't I obviously I wasn't there I I kept thinking about the Commissioners that were there when um former president Trump was in power to just hear all the divisions and because this was really heavily the administration was everywhere basically and and presenting and being part of the conversations besides the top people there were also the policy advisors that came that also actually some of them were local level government um that I it was interesting to hear their perspective um I attended arpa conversations as well that was really interested to me especially with our arpa conversation so that was good learning um and and then I think I we all followed each other on the urban the conversations and many of the other conversation so I'll leave it off I don't know oh I have time so you have 30 seconds one of the other thing I mean I appreciated that I enjoyed is building relationships along with you all getting to know us at a personal level laughing and and actually experiencing our I appreciated our Uber experience and our food uh experience um and just getting to know each other at a personal level I I feel like I can honestly say I know you all better a little bit at a personal level we get to know each other professionally but it provided that outlet to just connect at a human level us you know and leave the policy and the commission hat off so thank you for giving me a positive experience and and my colleagues know how vital caffeine is for me early in the morning to get going and commissioner Willie really did uh take care of all the uh cars and we needed to take and it it was really so helpful and appreciated and I also appreciate it and hope you'll uh share some information you attended the rural caucus County Rural County Caucus meeting so what have you got for it right I did I attended at the same time the chair was at the large County I was at the small and it was uh it was very interesting their primary topic was the farm bill and so they're going to be negotiating that farm bill and there's a lot to this actually that budget I was told as 1.4 trillion dollars it's a lot of money and and they were saying but still that's that's really not a big piece of the total budget so I don't know how many trillion we're talking about probably include snap yes yeah it includes yeah it includes a number of things Environmental water nutrition rural Broadband uh there's a lot to that um that was my first entree into the farm bill so I got a lot of work to do if I'm gonna follow up on that um and then like the chair said we learned a lot about rural Broadband that was a I mean that was two or three sessions that was real Broadband was discussed and it was very very good to get caught up on that the meetings that we had with Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden and uh bonamicis congresswoman bonavinci's office all good information their staff is all over this so I look forward to having a lot more acronyms to uh to learn and also learn about what next steps we need to do we are um that chair and I have that meeting I believe it's on Thursday and included will be that will be David from Van as well as Rachel from wyden's office so we are trying to get at the deep end of the pool pretty quickly here and the most to me the most fun one was uh the electric charging stations one um the presenters um is a is kind of a data collection place and so they've done a lot of research across the country about where uh how many charging stations you have in your region and of course they put up a map of the entire United States and and populated it with uh EV charging East Coast is doing a lot better job than we are um and then the variety of options they a couple of terms they used was EV desert so of course charging station deserts and I've experienced that when I drove to Roseburg and back um in the winter time so you don't get as many miles on your charge and so that was always interesting Megan was in the constant research of where's your next charging station and how do you get um so that was good and then range which is another thing I mean I I have experienced a little bit of that again whenever you plan a trip it's not like you can pull into a gas station and 15 minutes later you leave with a full tank of gas you you have at least an hour commitment of of level three Chargers um level two Chargers all that kind of stuff so they're gonna have to we as a county I would I would ask Stephen this if we have a permit process for charging stations or allowing charging stations and I I think there's some more work that I need to get find out about in regards to that but also focusing on some of our low-income neighborhoods to make sure that we have charging station availability there I know we have a couple of charging stations right out here that seem to be very highly used so that's good so anyway just some of that information I think probably we're going to see that there's going to be an additional emphasis on charging stations into the future and of course the question was always ask okay do we really have enough electricity to do these things and uh so as our electric vehicle is going to be stuck at home because we don't have any juice I've been assured that that's not going to be the case but you know we're going to have a lot of new electric cars charged or um brought online here in the next few years so we'll see anyway that was that was a fun conversation and I left 50 seconds on the table so there you go one of the sessions that commissioner fi and I each attended was Investments and opportunities implementing the energy and climate provisions of the inflation reduction act at the county level uh and that one of the speakers highlighted the climate pollution Reduction Program at I'll have to I think I need to type up my notes to look at how many different follow-up items I've got here then in the understanding the child care Workforce and mapping the policy landscape session I learned about wioa w-i-o-a for child care and learned a lot more about the wage supplements and Pathways the preschool development grants that went to 42 different states for the pathways into the child care and there's home visitation home visiting work for support in the Appropriations bill of last year that included apprenticeship and Early Child Care education Workforce support um and I don't know how much of this we need to look to take advantage of for Grants or if it's already there with the state so that's why I think we we need a little help to catch up because it sounds like we've had some unprecedented legislation that's been passed and I don't know beyond Broadband what programs counties need to follow up on they I want to give a big shout out to Naco because every single one of the sessions that I attended had a great roster of uh some part of the administration but multiple County Commissioners speaking uh telling giving us case studies they did what the problems were they were trying to solve the challenges and the opportunities and uh working to make information available so as we look to Future years we'll have to see because I know a year ago we had some more staff that were able to attend as well you know I walking in uh Diane and I were walking into the session together and we were talking about Nico and you know I need I wish I had spent more time with my clean water services lens on I don't know if if you did or uh commissioner Frye or anybody else but I think as as a whole the infrastructure bill is it's it's all of us together in there and I think the big the big message that we all walked out with was you know either you know get on the train or you're you're going to be standing at the station for a long time because this is this is a huge um injection of uh frankly money into the system that we're not going to see again so I I think lesson learned for me was I want to go with more clean water services lens next time and also I want to make sure that we are again like the chair said accessing the opportunities that present were there any particular items that you got out of meetings with staff that you want",

commissioner Willie online and over to you chair Harington good morning everyone and welcome to to the Washington County Board of Commissioners work session for Tuesday January 30th uh this is chair Katherine Harrington I'm joined in the room with Commissioners Pam tce and nefisa fi I assume commissioner Rogers will be joining us momentarily and we have commissioner online uh so welcome so um the first thing on today's agenda is checking in with the formal agenda for our meeting does anyone have any qu well first if I um given that we have bear with me for just a moment given that we have uh the a public it's not a public hearing but it's marked as a public hearing uh we have board deliberation on B and gross ordinance 882 uh and we are not opening a formal public hearing remember we've had that closed that and decided to delay our deliberation till today's meeting but uh through emails uh I I know that there are some folks who are planning on wanting to come and share their public comment during the public comment period so what I plan to do as the presiding officer is to ask clerk Moss if we have anyone who wishes to make public comment on anything not welcome commissioner Rogers anything not on today's agenda or um on any items on our action agendas meaning consent agenda or item two I'm explicitly not not going to say anything or exclude the ordinance 882 as well as findings um so if uh you could look out clerk Moss for people who want to speak on consent action item two or anything not on the agenda and those will be the people we prioritize in that public comment period I was planning on limiting it limiting it to the 10 minutes as we always have posted unless there are six people on non-agenda items and you know little slop there does that work for everyone here in the room first well let me check in with commissioner Willie commiss Willie are you okay with that okay thank you Shandon I have a question yes sir okay no I just going to say that I may have to depending on how strong my internet stays with me I may have to I shut my camera off but for right now we're good so and I'm good with what you just suggested terrific thank you commissioner Willie commiss Commissioners here in the room any thoughts yeah I have a question commission um chair Harington um what you so the the first 10 minutes will be non-agenda items for people who or any yes anything not on the agenda or on things that are on the agenda other than F1 or or G1 okay and which is the okay good I I I only point that out because there's a um group of people that reached out to come um to testify in terms of their building their advocacies just to get in front of the board and I wanted to make sure they had an opportunity to that's what non-agenda items means y yep great yes chair can I I just want to clarify that so um ordinance 882 is listed under public hearing because this is a continuation of the public hearing process so to be clear with um the commun need this is board deliberation only for that for that item your board had already held the public hearing on that item and so when this um situation occurs um clerk Moss list in r or deliberation only on your agenda to um with the hopes of providing that Clarity to community members yep so we will not be taking testimony on 882 correct it's the bottom line we've closed record on that and that's I'm I'm supportive of that I just wanted to yeah say those words you with us commissioner Rogers on that okay all right um were there any other questions on anything else for agenda okay and um while I could um I know we'll have board communication later uh but I wanted to to take advantage of the opportunity first thing in the morning um thank you very much for uh helping my husband and I leave a day early for our vacation uh the second ice rainstorm uh started just as we boarded the airplane and uh the airline folks told us we were the third plane out before they closed the airport down uh so complicated saon um but we got out we had a wonderful vacation um I really appreciate all of you uh Commissioners leadership staff and all of our Washington County Employees for helping our community through a very difficult time I'm really pleased to see the business Outreach as well and I know that especially our Lut team uh really stepped it up uh I could see it while I was here during the first storm in terms of getting uh every Road open so that no one was stuck in their home so that emergency vehicles could get through uh but also stabilizing our community and uh also assisting small businesses who uh felt the impact of closure for over a week so good job everyone I know that our Lut team particularly has continued work to do uh I saw through the Friday facts the number of Lane miles that were sanded that's half the job so they still have to go through and Street sweep all those very same roads uh so I I expect that there's some overtime in in employees future uh and I really appreciate the efforts that our team has made so thank you thank you thank you so and I Washington County particularly and commissioner tesa's District district two was really hit hard by the wind damage I absolutely feel for those folks whose homes have been damaged by Fallen trees and can only imagine what it's like now that we in the height of the rainy season and what continued damage will ensue on their homes and we've already had a tight labor market and finding uh contractor folks so I just oh my heart goes out to them really absolutely okay so our next item is item two resolution and Order discussion on using future trans at lodging tax revenue to assist the City of Hillsboro in the development of a minor league ballpark so uh this uh agenda item has our um County Administrator Tanya Angie and Mr Anderson and I would imagine that commissioner Willie also has uh some things to contribute as well so I'll turn it over to you folks good morning chair and board uh County Council Anderson and I will jointly be doing this uh presentation so the purpose of today's presentation is to uh present a resolution in order for the purpose of assisting the City of Hillsboro in the development of a minor league ballpark so really the question before your board today is if you would like to add a proposed resolution in order to your February 6th board meeting consideration so background on this item at the January 11th Round Table um BCC requ requested staff to bring forward a draft Arno for discussion uh by your board this was based on commissioner Wily's request to the board for $8 million to support ballpark funding so today I am not going to go through um the details of the actual ballpark um um or um Hillsboro Hops operating pro forma on the park there is some attached material materal within um your packet really what the action and the resolution in order would be would be an rno with the city of Hillsboro the C City of Hillsboro is the OWN would be the owner of the ballpark and they would be issuing revenue bonds to complete and construct the ballpark for the purposes of the Hops leasing the ballpark so it's really in the city of Hillsboro's hands to work through all of the details with the Hops as far as the oper ating Etc so we won't be getting into that today because our staff really are not the subject matter experts in that space so the proposed funding um um uh Source would be our transient lodging tax also known as TLT so on this slide here and I'm not going to read through because your board has seen this in the packet just wanted to provide an outline of what the County's TLT um proceeds are and how they are um um split between uses within County uh so the next slide one of the questions your board had asked is if not the Hops what are other Capital needs the county has that TLT could be an allowable use for so one of those items are the fair complex what you'll see in the first bullet point is just phase one there is a hyperlink to the full Fair master plan and there are actually three phases es that the master plan contemplates of funding as your board is aware this plan was adopted in 2019 and there was not a fun funding strategy attached to um the fair master plan that is on I will call it the list of items that the county does need to address as we continue to work through um building our robust Capital Improvement plan the other element is our wingspan events on Center your board has been briefed that we really need to address long-term operations and capital at winsan it is very customary um in a small Market venue such as wingspan that there is public financial support helping to offset um operations of the center we are seeing that as a need also we don't have identified um minor maintenance or long or large Capital maintenance for wingspan we do anticipate bringing more of a robust conversation to your board in Quarter Two of 2024 on this item as I indicated at your round table on January 11th today I would not be able to come with the full answer to some of these but just highlighting what those potential um uses would be um in response to your question at this time um County Council Anderson can walk through the rno or address any questions on the rno I appreciate um both County Council Anderson and our CFO Greg mun um and assistant to the County Administrator McKibbon meeting with Hillsboro to um to bring these materials forward Hillsboro staff have reviewed this rno and this has been a collaborative effort in constructing the rno and with that Mr Anderson sure so if you look at the draft Arno um basically all the recital are kind of a description of the details of the project why there's a need for a new uh Stadium out there are you you g to walk through each page I can if you want uh I just have uh two comments on the contents that um I think would improve or clarify the rno I think it's a quite good",

        "text": " or come as close as possible to using them uh although it will be 90 days before they're actually officially enforced but that's going to be at the baseline for proposals for this year we will then be sending of course uh we have university of oregon doing some site some additional analysis to make where the old code was what the target is for the new code so that everyone who is doing a proposal can sort of do an apples to apples sort of look at what proposals do come in so everyone can analyze and repeat other people's so the next steps of course would be to look are to look for the upcoming announcement uh that begins the proposal period again either friday the 1st or i believe it's the 5th i think it's tuesday would be the date to look for that starting baseline point we will try and have all of the um when that when the probe the announcement goes out we will have the information available such as the baseline written document as well as some of the baseline inputs that you would be using for doing any energy any questions for mark and do want to let everyone know that this is for the intent of you you know getting this out to hopefully be an april 2023 code of course depending on publication delays and like it might be june 1 and then with the grace period for between that allows for use of the old code or the new code and probably by october of 2023 the new energy provisions will be mandatory so it sounds like no codes or no questions or comments residential be happy to talk about this is david haslam um from earth advantage and i the question i had mark was uh in in looking at the materials that have been shared previously i wasn't sure on the cost information that bcd was going to be are you going to be providing ground rules for how a proposer would the costs of measures or were you um gonna try and actually the costs that a proposer should use we would be providing sort of a baseline you know the usda federal building is sort of the baseline so we're looking at same square footage and same square footage would be sort of the starting point and then there's a baseline home so you're noting what was so that you can put analyze what went in when it went out so sometimes it's adding new sometimes there's stuff taken out replacement put back in but some general guidelines on that so that people know it's more giving the background information so that if someone says well we took out 200 square feet of window when actually there's only 100 square feet of window involved so so that people can look at the numbers and compare them properly and then so but for instance if someone just is a follow-up if someone were to say oh we should increase insulation our estimate for the increased cost of increasing that particular insulation you know whatever 10 cents a square foot or something what you're putting forward would be the rules of the proposer substantiates 10 cent per square foot cost increase so that that's how people are doing it on an apples to apples basis yes and then if you're saying this is how my this is the wall square footage area that you know let's say well wall cavity and selection here's how much or total square footage of exterior wall this is how much we're saying for the the home and it should hopefully align with the usdoe home so with your david to answer your question for the cost no that's up to you um the rules are going to kind of outline um all that so take a look at the rules that will be presented on the 22nd and then within that um it's up to the proposer to give us the cost the one cost wise that we will be producing that will be part of it will be standardized cost for the uh cost of energy so depending on what kind of fuel is being used you know whether it's electricity gas or bone dry tons of biofuel um we're gonna have that just like we've got the commercial posted on our page we're gonna do a residential um and so that's the only cost that we're gonna provide you guys proposers will provide their own their own costs in their own format okay and then thank you for that explanation mark and kelly and just to make sure i understand but the costs that a proposer would propose awesome they'll be using the same square footage um assumptions from one proposer to the next but is do the rules and i guess i can wait and see but do the rules spell out and here's the here's the at least the type of substantiation that um you should explain your pricing is based off of so that the review committee can say oh that 10 cents was based off of you know builder interviews or actual bids or you know some other thing i put the rules in the chat there so you can read the rules and how that's all written out okay thank you kelly and i mean that's all the rules that are happening that day it's a busy calendar and then there's then it's linked to the 3 p.m one is the rules that are being put forward so um the answers to your questions should be in there but if if not ask them next wednesday ask for their i have a question i'm looking at the requirements on the site and i'm wondering um the difference in the cold climates are a bit more so you know a lot of the rural areas are lower income and i'm wondering how that's going to be accounted for within these specifications so it's an equity question you know rural areas have a higher uh requirement to meet so are are we going to be showing that the energy savings is going to uh be the same or more as the mixed climate zone oh no we're gonna when i produce that uh document for the um the cost it'll be a statewide average so it'll be you know a little bit higher for rural and a little bit lower for urban but then the proposer say you know the cost of uh increasing going from r49 to r60 you know might be higher in a rural area versus a urban area but again we would hope it would be a statewide average we wouldn't split them into uh two different okay and so as as far as the energy savings goes uh is it kind of the uh lifetime payback of that measure or how are you weighting that when you're making that well there's a waiting um though the weights are done by type of house and there's eight different um types of homes uh it's not based on on um and you know composers can do a lifetime or life cycle assessment or they can do you know straight across we're not really um we're not requiring that uh at this time obviously you know life cycle is is the best but even the national i'm on the national modeling code committee and um you know for for this and maybe they even punted on on requiring that there's there's a spreadsheets and information plenty of information out there uh that's been produced but the well the subcommittee at least um has left that open to uh to a proposal as well so we're basically following with national icc iecc is doing okay thank you and mark is there opportunity on the 22nd when the rules are discussed for more clarification on these issues as just real quick so the 22nd is for giving feedback only on that on that date that's you know we're at the last stages of the the rulemaking so this is the sort of additional public comment period where the division can take additional input from the from the public so yes but there won't be feedback from us it's really taking testimony day is what the rule making hearing happens that's what happens on the rule making hearing got it okay and by the way uh david hessleman had to leave for a board meeting so he had to jump off angela you have a question in the chat um can you clarify that question yeah i saw those traditions this meeting so the like rules that were linked um those rules for the hearing next week looks like those rules are only energy efficiency tables not anything related to salute pv is that am i reading that correctly uh this is mark heiser with division yes this is well about adoption of energy efficiency measures within within the residential building code yes this is about that of when it comes to renewables there's also the ability to comment but i see that kelly posted um a little bit there which does include yes the chapter 11 does include the solar ready provisions that are required under executive order 1720 to show the updates that are in for for that when you see the posted new version the new chapter 11 will have the solar ready provisions that were in residential reach code so there was a lot of discussion um good input that went into that we thank everybody for it and so we are bringing in the more modified solar ready provisions from the 20 residential reach code those provisions are being brought in to replace the current residential solar ready provision so they're they're getting expanded slightly let's reach here thank you i didn't see this link that was that kelly put there in the chat is where can i find these new solar ready they will be in the draft version that will be posted in uh when the 45 day period opens up but was just letting people know that right now that yes what was put into the residential reach code is what will be baseline residential code for solar ready that's going to be the baseline that the residential reach code is available you can look at those provisions and if you're if you're wanting to start on something right now that is available and kelly put in the link to the residential code residential reach code excuse me okay and then you said they'll be when will they be posted in 45 days uh no it'll be posted either the first or i believe fifth of july with the notice they may be up a little earlier but when the notice goes out the shall we say baseline chapter 11 will be available and any revisions that want to be made should be made based on that posted chapter 11. just one other thing i don't know if anybody um caught it i posted it in the chat the notice went out yesterday about having a uh on the 13th uh the rmsb is going to appoint a code review committee um and so they're you know looking for and well participants through an application and so i posted the application process and just kind of the first part of the",

        "text": " to um to that tax credit where it doesn't take a whole lot else to to meet that meet that specification to help support the new code uh next slide um then just a couple quick uh bullet points on some of the other Ira Provisions there's tax credits for manufacturers there's Advanced industrial facilities deployment program and then some additional funding for a variety of programs in rural areas that are that's included with the IRA uh I think that rounds it out Roger uh next slide is there anything else oh yeah never under the biannual Energy report so I'm happy to if there's any questions uh we can take those now any questions from the IRA stuff there's one in the chat there Blake from Kevin oh yeah for the codes finding does each take an equal cut or does that depend on um right now a lot of that's actually still in in flux I think there's still some ambiguity whether or not that's a formula based grant where they just assign you know each state um you know that qualifies that has to you know submit a plan for how they're going to use the funding if it's just like based on that formula amount um that each state gets or if it'll be more competitive um and from what I understand that still hasn't really been determined yet I know there's some organizations I think like uh I recently heard that nazia which is where it kind of represents a lot of State energy offices was providing some just support for it being formula based but that hasn't uh that hasn't been really decided yet all right any more questions yeah I just had a question around um the state's plan uh to implement These funds um how can we follow that or be involved as as the funding comes in yeah it's that's a really good question um we will certainly be part of a public process for us to develop our plan um you know I would anticipate I'm not exactly sure what that Forum would look like but um but it could certainly be something that we could bring to this group or a separate group um but we would fully um you know expect and want to receive public input on on how to implement those programs great thank you there's a always information available on oto's front page of the website as well you'll see a link right there in the front talking about the federal one of the things that you know we've just really identified as a need for our agency and a lot of other agencies is just general coordination on a lot of these funding programs from a federal level utility level you know across the state like Oregon Housing and Community Services has um Energy Efficiency weatherization funding that could potentially overlap with some of this funding um and you know our our end goal is to make it as you know as streamlined and as understandable as possible for for the consumer right like that if somebody has a project that they need to know which potential incentives that might qualify for that to make it you know at the least confusing that that it could be if somebody's trying to trying to utilize these available funding sources and you know ideally it's like okay you'll make one application and the other state you know of all these available State funding is is kind of there and somebody can identify whether or not they qualify for the different funding sources in kind of one location but that's something that we're we're really exploring and trying to hopefully optimize when it when it all gets implemented great thanks Blake yeah we can follow up with uh other questions too after the next couple of slides um but for the moment I'd like to talk to you about the biennial Energy report that Oregon Department of energy puts together every two years and this one is the 2022 Burr and affectionately known and as you can see on the on the page here it has an introduction and I give you a link there if you'd like to go see there's a huge amount of information involved in the Burr it's a report that's based on analysis of data and information collected and compiled by the by Odo and provides data and information on key energy resources policies Trends forecasts and what that means to Oregon the 2022 report is divided into several sections as you can see here energy by the Numbers timeline of energy history in Oregon resource Technology reviews and energy 101 the first one there the energy by the numbers is detailed information on how energy flows through the second one the timeline of energy history in Oregon I gotta tell you this is an amazing flow chart that it's a timeline and it's just got a ton of information from before the 1800s actually uh to the present day one of our Communications people was nice enough to put this together and you should just go take a look it's it's the resource and Technology review page that section covers the spectrum of traditional and Innovative energy resources and Technologies from the basics about electricity generation to energy efficient buildings technology and transportation fuels and then the last section here noted is the energy 101 that section aims to help readers understand the basics about how energy systems are planned and managed along with Innovative actions within communities and sectors a lot of good information there as well but then the very final section is something we added on this year and that's the policy briefs and I noted a link on here as well that might be more relevant to this discussion here and that is a a discussion about what can be done in existing buildings so a lot of good information there in the 2022 Burr and I want just want to call your attention to it and provide those links to you to go take a look and thank you so much to all the people in this audience that have helped us with compiling that report so the next slide we want to move to is uh Blake talking about the Joint Task Force on resilient efficient buildings yeah thanks Roger um yeah not a lot of huge updates to give here but you know for folks that have been kind of tracking this this work just wanted to highlight that the final meeting of this task force is actually happening right after this meeting um and you know you're uh certainly encourage every anybody who's interested to tune into that but um you know this task force has done a lot of uh a lot of great discussion and Analysis over the course of the last like four months I think um so there they've got a lot of material and reports and Analysis that's out there for for review but their final meeting is happening at three o'clock uh um or they're kind of going to review their final report and findings so good to call that out Blake yep any questions for either of those two topics the Burr or The Joint Task Force not seen any all right so I guess we can move Mark to the next section teaming you up for let's see there we go results of the 2023 RSC code yes thanks Roger uh again Mark Heiser with building codes division gives sort of an update on what has been happening with the code adoption committee uh a majority of the work on chapter 11 has been done uh there will be a a little less cleanup relative to the last item on the page the ERI path at the last committee meeting um the committee decisions are done of course this is just the very beginning there's again review by the residential and manufacturer structures board they will do another review of all the items that are coming out of the code committee and be forwarding them to um making their vote and recommendations for final uh sending on to the division for adoption for the 2023 residential a bit of language cleanup um some things that were were worked on uh one note is it's uh then I think is covered again on uh another slide that if people were really trying to move toward getting Ducks inside such a big impact and if people wish to remain uh have things with deeply buried Ducks um they do have to do a an extra additional measure so not just one but two of them uh future code may have more more ways to look at the code you know and on excuse me on additional measures as we noted there was an approval to get rid of the old really sort of an energy modeling path for residential buildings which very few people do have ever done and moving on to something aligns with the international energy conservation code residential version which is the ERI path which is essentially a codified version of getting a hers rating so that was approved for forwarding by the we'll go to the next slide so the items were presented to the code um on October 27th and November 3rd it started with the division's draft chapter 11 intending to achieve the goal of uh meeting EO 17-20 to get equivalent of the I think it's version 0.06 of the zerh program so equivalent performance not exactly adopting it but getting the equivalent energy performance um proponents of energy proposals came in looking to continued improvements to different paths or to go beyond the base 1720 um code recommendations are moving forward again to the rmsb which is the residential and manufactured structures one quick note when we put this out it looked like January 11th was going to be the rmsb meeting that is going to be put residential code has a lot with um some other issues kind of slowed down the adoption process and the review by the committee relative to structure snow um and the like so um the committee is going to take a little longer and we're expecting the rmsp probably to be rescheduled for sometime in February again yes this so we put the schedule together when we thought they'd get through the uh review a little faster solar ready is moving to section R 324 there may be continuing work on that as time goes on I'm trying to remember the final results on that um had to be in another meeting but they I believe they got through most of the solar ready section and did some to that Dan really trying to move all of the solar Provisions the construction Provisions that are in the structural code as well as what was in chapter 11 into one location so that it can all be found in one place next slide Roger again some of the highlights um the additional measure seven was had a not a very positive impact on the 2021 code and it's being removed for the again as earlier note noted earlier we're looking to get the um Ducks inside moving more towards having it be a integral part of the code the FAU fan unit air handler unit does need to come inside now no exceptions for that language was cleaned up the option to",

        "text": " state um and how to maybe um create a rhythm like that one thought that came to mind is sort of rob actually in particular works closely with the regional solutions team um i can put a link in the chat for that but that kind of has some organization to it so that if if we were to sort of sponsor try to facilitate a workshop that was perhaps co-facilitated with community-based groups that are active in that region learn about areas of interest for projects and try to match up where we can with resources to help those communities as well as potential public bodies that are eligible but we would i think need some help in figuring out you know within those regions which um you know we don't i don't think yet know exactly um who we should be maybe reaching out to to partner with on perhaps co-facilitating or co-hosting workshop like that and so that might be something for this um committee to to think about if if you're um comfortable with offering some suggestions on who we could sort of reach out to kind of going back to um quiche's comment about helping us sort of build some relationships there this is les perkins um just to build on what you were just saying um there's a strong need for the figuring out the public private partnership component of this um and so it seems like there's a couple of different components of outreach i mean one is is looking for potential projects which could be coming from just about anywhere but i think the difficult part you're going to find is the public private partnership and figuring out that relationship we've been trying in hoodover county to look at how the county could facilitate taking federal funds for projects and it's not there's a lot of liability questions roles and responsibilities it seems like you're first outreach really needs to be um helping to support those organizations that could be the public side of the public private partnership uh because if that's not figured out not going to get projects in the ground uh and so that's going to be a barrier early on that's great feedback less and you know you're not in a great position as a as a county commissioner to kind of represent the the public body side of that equation and in this discussion from randy's comment and what you just said thinking about you know as projects get developed sort of a top-down communication where we can reach out to public entities the utility you know consumer-owned utilities or municipalities and if they generate projects we need to figure out how they reach down into the communities but then the other part of it is to think about the project that starts in the community and they need tools to be able to and communicate with the public body and how do you march into a city or a utility or a county and enable you know sort of get a project to be visualized within that public body so thinking about both directions and how we can support project creation for both the applicant public body and also the the community members that are ideas for projects and they have a difficult time engaging um a city or a county or a utility so good thoughts i maybe we'll pause and i see um ruchi did you want to share oh um i think i might pass it to christy um on the line to talk a little bit about a couple of um workshops that are already sort of in the works yeah i just wanted to it's just so relevant to what commissioner perkins shared and we still have some work to do on this front but um we have a draft outreach plan in the works and one of the things that seemed pretty clear to us was that reaching out to the organizations that represent the sort of the umbrella groups for the eligible entities listed in the bill would be a good place to start we already have um although word hasn't gone out yet publicly but we just settled on a date for an aos association of oregon counties in league of oregon cities um shared webinar sort of event that would happen most likely on march 18th is the date that we've settled on so you'll start to see information about that coming out and i need to do some reaching out to the special districts association of oregon we've had some suggestions about irrigation districts less i'd love your ideas of who would be a good a good place to host that sort of webinar what we're asking is we'll sort of put the webinar on we're asking these groups to share them out to their membership and sort of co-host them with us so i'll reach out to you under separate cover and see if you can give me some ideas about the irrigation district hat on of who the right convener is for that we also have an offer from danny martinez who's on this committee to have him bring bring us to third thursday meetings of the nine federally recognized tribes that they hold every month so we're working on kind of doing those sorts of things first and then doing the outreach we were talking about um to more like community-based organizations as well but but like doing first things first those four groups like you said uh commissioner perkins and then moving on thank you it's very helpful yeah thanks i hope you enjoyed me calling you like six different things in one i'm just good less is fine i don't need commissioner perkins just know that we're gonna like not be able to help ourselves and do both all right thanks so that kind of speaks to sort of trying to support outreach and engagement from sort of uh two angles one is sort of the public bodies which frankly our agency has a little bit more experience with and these sort of um you know meetings and workshops that rob said earlier where we sort of may see the familiar faces over and over again but we really want to explore different ways to approach it from the other angle which is the communities themselves since the eligible bodies need to be able to demonstrate in their applications that serving communities how do we sort of um help communities also bring forward projects and find you know an eligible body to work with to to explore that project and there's sort of um an interesting piece there where we have the planning grants of course which i think would provide a lot of support but wanting to sort of get uh the word out to a degree where people feel um that they are at a place where they can apply for a planning grant is the sort um space in which we are looking for ideas from the committee as well do you see what i mean there in terms of the rhythm of the likely application process and where we can try to bring more people to the table especially on the community side and i think that also highlights where um in some cases you know we at odo do have some strengths as a state agency for reaching out to public bodies and consumer-owned utilities and christie's got a lot of contacts um throughout oregon like aoc and loc and these events king perkins can also you know representing couldn't help it um representing counties you know we we have kind of both sides of the of the application process covered pretty well in the committee and some some folks are going to be well entrenched on both the community side and the public body side but you know we definitely see that odo is going to have a very active role in this outreach as well that we're going to every opportunity we possibly can to be presenting at conferences and to meet with loc and aoc and um you know we we meet with the consumer-owned utility managers every three months and you know the the type of outreach that happens during working hours you know monday morning at 10 a.m where we get the public body we're going to be helpful in that front but then reaching out to the folks who are not able to attend that type of meeting is you know a spot where we're going to need a lot more help so this has been great feedback any other thoughts on on this one all right for number four it sounds like we'll just do a next step and if committee members um or others are sort of interested in helping us understand what number four could look like i think that's kind of the takeaway from from that as well as a request from all of you to think about um your own network and and what you might be able to offer as it relates to support and sharing information does that sound like the right next steps from number four rob did i miss anything that sounds just right yeah and um so yeah i think that having having this kind of group that's focused on rigorous outreach tasks and and wanting to explore the financial support would be great you know we will be taking care of kind of the admin side of how we get those contracts out to folks in a way that's hopefully not too administratively burdensome and we can come up with you know simple deliverables um that we can all agree upon and make make it so that the contract generation isn't too painful and we can just carry on with our work all right so i think that that was um that was a really good discussion around community outreach piece and around the idea that we could be providing support to committee members and potentially other based organizations to help spread the the next question is just down to kind of some operational things how frequently should the advisory committee meet and for just the proposal four times a is four times a year a good number should the meetings be tied to program activities or just scheduled on a recurring quarterly basis so that we all have them set in our calendar something along those lines so that's about meetings i think a quarterly uh touch base is probably a good idea so it is on our calendars and doesn't get lost in the rest of our great thanks stan and you know we started out this whole thing with a four-hour meeting and now we're on two um two seems a lot more digestible and if we're just doing check-ins i would two or even one could be possible although it's really nice to be able to dig into things especially now as we're we're building the program so that's the other thing is to think about duration of meetings maybe we plan on two hours and if we wrap up early everyone gets some time back bob i this is quisha um i agree on the four times a year i am just wondering what do you do if timing doesn't align with certain program activities or you know the application review processor and advisory committee is needed so i mean i guess four times a year with the understanding that special",
